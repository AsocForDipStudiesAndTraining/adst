                <p>AMBASSADOR ROBERT B. OAKLEY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy and Thomas Stern</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 7, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1999 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Bob, thanks very much for giving us your time to review your Foreign Service
                    career. Let me start by asking you about your background and your education.</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was born in Dallas, Texas, but moved to Shreveport, Louisiana where I
                    stayed until I attended South Kent School in Connecticut. I was there for three
                    years and enjoyed it tremendously. By happenstance, without having much
                    information, I decided to go to Princeton. The people at South Kent had enough
                    credibility to get me into that University, despite my apparent indifference
                    during the admissions interview. At Princeton, I majored in history and
                    philosophy, but I had no idea what career I wanted to pursue. The Korean war was
                    ongoing at graduation time; I decided to volunteer for the officers' training
                    program being offered by the Navy rather than being drafted. So in 1952, I
                    joined the Navy; it assigned me eventually to naval intelligence and sent me to
                    Japan, where I spent two and a half fascinating years in Yokosuka as a member of
                    the staff of the Command of Far East forces. While in Japan, I decided that I
                    was really interested in foreign affairs, although it was not clear to me how I
                    might pursue that interest. I did conclude that, in light of the people I was
                    working with, the Navy was not up to my expectations and I decided to get out of
                    that service. I hoped that if I ever entered government service again, I would
                    try to avoid the kind of bureaucratic problems that I had encountered. I thought
                    that the senior levels of the Navy paid too much attention to individual desires
                    rather than basic policy issues. On the other hand, towards the end of my tour
                    in Japan, I worked for Captain Rufus Taylor, who headed up the intelligence
                    staff. He later became the chief of Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and later
                    Deputy Director of CIA. I told him that had he been my boss six months earlier I
                    probably would have decided to stay in the Navy. Unfortunately, there were not
                    enough Taylors in my experience and that pushed me to leave the Navy.</p>
                <p>Not knowing what I was going to do, I talked to a number of corporations, looking
                    for a job in their government relations departments. I was told that the
                    positions in those small departments were primarily filled by ex-government
                    people that the corporations had hired away from places like the State
                    Department and CIA after they had been in those agencies for a dozen years or
                    more. After that experience, I decided to attend graduate school and selected
                    Tulane University, and I also decided to take the Foreign Service entrance
                    examination which I passed. After going through all the clearances, I was asked
                    to report for duty in the Department in July, 1957. That ended my efforts to get
                    a master's degree.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>When I started the A-100 course, it was at a time when Wristonization was in full
                    force. The Foreign Service grades were being adjusted to cover eight grades from
                    the six that had existed before. That meant that some people had to go back to
                    being an FSO-8 and some of them were sent to the A-100 course. Frank Carlucci, a
                    Princeton classmate of mine, fell in that category. Dan O'Donahue, who spent
                    most of his career working in Asia was in this class. Quincy Lumsden, who became
                    an Arabist, was in the class as was Alan Davis who had a career in Africa. Paul
                    Cleveland, who had a career in Asia was there. They all became Ambassadors and
                    had over two decades of distinguished careers. I think that every one was
                    considering the Foreign Service as a career; no one looked at it as just a phase
                    of life. I must say I found the course very boring. I told that to my mother who
                    replied that perhaps that was part of the training program; she was not
                    necessarily wrong on that score. But FSI was not a complete loss. I met my
                    wife-to-be there, thanks to another classmate, James Briggs, who had known her
                    at Fletcher. She was a class behind us when Jim introduced us in the glamorous
                    facilities of Arlington Towers. We fell quickly in love. As a Foreign Service
                    officer she had to give up her career to marry me under the regulations then in
                    effect in the Department. I still marvel at my good fortune and her willingness
                    to sacrifice her career.</p>
                <p>1957 was a year when the Department had too many FSOs and not enough jobs for
                    them. In fact, late in that year, a freeze was put on further recruitment. After
                    finishing the A-100 course, I was assigned to French language class in Arlington
                    where I learned little if anything. Then the Department sent me to the language
                    school in Nice, which was superb. Being in a totally French environment 24 hours
                    a day made all the difference. I really learned to speak French there and to
                    speak it quite well.</p>
                <p>For all my troubles, I was then assigned to Khartoum. I was called by phone about
                    two hours after our graduation (every one else had an assignment, an unnerving
                    situation) and told to leave within the next two days to go to the Sudan as a
                    General Services Officer. I didn't know very much about Khartoum and even less
                    about being a General Services Officer. That was my first real taste of the
                    Foreign Service. A new position had been created, a General Services officer.
                    That post had never had one. Now, however, the Embassy had been given the
                    responsibility for supporting an ICA [International Cooperation Administration]
                    assistance mission - a first in the annals of the State Department. The ICA
                    staff had not yet arrived, but there I was in charge of general services, not
                    knowing anything about it.</p>
                <p>The assignment turned out to be a very interesting one. From the career point of
                    view, I have always maintained that you are better prepared for the Foreign
                    Service profession in the long term if you start out in a general services or a
                    vice-consul position than in any other first assignment. Such jobs give the
                    opportunity to see post operations from the bottom up.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So for sixteen months, I was the GSO. I had a peculiar boss, the administrative
                    officer, who preferred to sit in his office with the door closed. If he got any
                    complaints about my activities, and there were a lot of them, he would scream at
                    me. Never mind that I had absolutely no training in this function and that I had
                    to learn everything by trial and error. The ICA assistance mission was not to
                    exceed twenty employees; by the time the first year was over, it had reached 85
                    and was still growing. We had to support all of those people, and the main
                    burden of it was mine. This included wild drives across sandy miles of desert
                    tracks to and from the temporary airfield, an old WW II Royal Air Force base.
                    One night, in addition to diplomatic pouches, I found an ICA family of six. No
                    one at the post had known they were coming. It was a wild time. The Sudan had
                    inter alia placed an embargo on all imports except essentials, to save foreign
                    exchange; therefore there was very little available on the local market.
                    Furniture and furnishings had been sent by Washington for twenty people; it went
                    very quickly and we had to scramble every day to support the growing aid
                    presence; we bought up all the furniture and office furnishings in Khartoum. The
                    number of acceptable apartments and houses in Khartoum were soon also all taken
                    up; I suspect we managed to triple the rents in that city in that one year
                    period of time. So our increasing presence was very useful for Khartoum's
                    economy. But it probably took two years before the assistance staff could mount
                    any kind of aid program. They lived in Khartoum in large houses,
                    air-conditioned, driving big cars, working in big offices - all of which I had
                    managed to acquire, with the help of a few local employees and a few American
                    staff employees, most of whom were almost as inexperienced as I was. Needless to
                    say, this ostentatious American presence with no visible benefits for the Sudan
                    generated a lot of criticism.</p>
                <p>After four months, my fianc�e, Phyllis Elliott, flew to Cairo where we were
                    married. There had been no time for this earlier because of the suddenness of my
                    assignment to Khartoum, rather than Europe or the Department which we had
                    expected. Khartoum seemed somehow too small, so we decided on Cairo where we had
                    friends at the Embassy. Phyllis' father gave her a one-way ticket as a wedding
                    present.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>At the same time, we had a wonderful Ambassador, James Moose, who had spent
                    almost all of his career in the Arab world. He spoke Arabic fluently. The Sudan
                    had just achieved its independence and was in the throes of great political
                    excitement and great optimism for the future. The young Sudanese were returning
                    from the best schools in the West - Oxford and Cambridge. My wife and I were
                    practically the only young people in the Embassy. The Ambassador and Mrs. Moose
                    apparently decided that they wanted to use us to get to know the younger
                    Sudanese generation, who were expected to be in charge of the country in the not
                    too distant future. So Phyllis and I were invited to many receptions and dinners
                    at the Ambassador's residence. Ambassador Moose made it very clear to me that he
                    was depending on me to meet the young Sudanese returnees. So we had a great
                    time; these young people would drop by our house and tell us that their sister
                    was getting married that evening and that they wanted us to join them for the
                    ceremony and the festivities. They would also ask us to go with them into the
                    countryside. We represented to them the younger generation of Americans and we
                    were all anxious to know each other better.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Moose was an introvert, who understood the Arab world and the Arab
                    mentality. He viewed the Sudan as another Arab country; he had been disappointed
                    in his career. He compared himself to Ambassador Raymond Hare, then our
                    ambassador to Egypt. I remember Ambassador Moose telling me that most of what
                    you become in the Foreign Service - that is what you achieve and how high you
                    rise - was due to three factors: what you know, who you know, and luck. He
                    thought the “who you know” is best achieved through contacts made in Washington.
                    Moose felt that he could have risen higher in the Service had he had more tours
                    in Washington - he had served there only for two years out of his whole career.
                    But I believe that he did not reach the levels to which he aspired because of
                    his personality rather than his lack of Washington assignments. He enjoyed his
                    overseas stints, but he felt that Hare had done better because he had spent more
                    time in Washington and therefore knew more people who could influence his
                    assignments. I must say that as I look back on my own career, I believe that
                    Moose was absolutely right. An officer can be absolutely competent, but if he or
                    she is not noticed by “movers and shakers”, then it will not be reflected in
                    assignments and promotions. If - and perhaps that is the “luck” side of the
                    Moose doctrine - on the other hand, your work is brought to the attention of the
                    Department's senior officials, they will see to it that you are rewarded. Phil
                    Habib and Joe Sisco were the two senior officials who did the most for my
                    career. But Moose did not have a flair for bringing his work to the attention of
                    the right people; he operated by making quiet contacts.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My activities did cause some strains with the administrative officer. One day, he
                    called me into his office and told me that I was not to see any more Sudanese
                    and that my job was that of a General Services officer and not political
                    officer. I told him that I was meeting those that the Ambassador wanted me to
                    stay in touch with and that if he, the administrative officer, had any problems
                    with this, he should take them up with the Ambassador. Needless to say, my first
                    efficiency report was less than stellar; I got a 1 plus on a scale of 1-6 (six
                    was the top). After sixteen months, the Department finally sent not one, but
                    three experienced FSOs to replace me; I guess it figured it would take that many
                    to clean up the mess I had left behind. I was transferred to the political
                    section.</p>
                <p>The Sudanese civil service was very good; many of the officials had received
                    excellent training from Great Britain during the colonial years. I would say
                    that the British Sudan Service was ranked between the British Foreign and
                    Colonial Services. The individual Britisher who served in the Sudan would have
                    acquired many friends and a wonderful reputation among the Sudanese, even though
                    the Sudanese were strongly opposed to being a colony. They wanted their
                    independence. The Sudanese, as individuals, have wonderful qualities. We made a
                    lot of close friends, many of whom are still close to us, even after thirty
                    years. But they have never been able to govern themselves well; as a
                    generalization that always has exceptions, they are not very good managers; they
                    are too fractious for that. The North-South, Muslim-Christian/Animist split has
                    made things much more difficult for Sudan. The civil war was going on even while
                    we were there and it continues to this day.</p>
                <p>We greatly enjoyed our personal relationships with various Sudanese individuals.
                    Phyllis and I traveled widely in the country and also accompanied the Ambassador
                    on some of his trips. We loved the country. It was an exciting tour for us; we
                    watched the rise of a younger generation of Sudanese, full of hope and
                    expectations. Unfortunately, the country collapsed later on several occasions
                    and never fulfilled the aspirations of the younger generation. But in the late
                    1950s, it was a wonderful country in which to serve.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, we mounted a large assistance program - roughly $100
                    million - which at that time was a very significant amount. The assistance
                    agreement had to be ratified by the Sudanese Parliament; to our astonishment, we
                    found that the British were lobbying against ratification. They didn't want us
                    to “poach” on their territory. The British showed a lot of animosity at the
                    policy level, even though we had a number of close personal friends among the
                    British. In fact, they were spying on my wife and me which was very amusing.
                    Since we had moved into a house previously occupied by a CIA officer, and I had
                    a background in Naval Intelligence, the British could not believe I was a GSO.
                    To them, this was a cover. Eventually, the British pressure on the Sudanese
                    Parliament did not succeed and the agreement was ratified. The U.S. was not
                    looked upon as the Sudan's savior, but we were regarded as an important player.
                    We viewed the Sudan as an important country in Africa, but not a major factor in
                    our foreign policy scheme. Egypt, to the North, was the important country and
                    the Sudan worried about its relationship with that country. Egypt was the
                    keystone to the Sudan's foreign policy; they were well aware that Egypt had been
                    vexed because it couldn't annex the Sudan. A referendum had been held in 1956
                    and independence had won. But Egypt viewed itself and was viewed as the “big
                    brother”, which engendered a love-hate relationship. While I was in Khartoum,
                    the Egyptians and the Sudanese negotiated, with considerable difficulty, a
                    treaty concerning the Nile water rights, which enabled Nasser to move ahead with
                    the construction of the Aswan Dam. He could not have done so had he not had
                    agreement from the Sudanese on how the Nile waters were to be divided. The close
                    U.S. relationships with Israel were obviously well known to the Sudanese, but
                    they were not an important factor in our relations with them at that time. It
                    was not a big issue; the Sudan was far enough removed from the Arab-Israeli
                    action and had enough domestic problems to be too concerned by events that were
                    taking place far away.</p>
                <p>Internally, the Sudanese were concerned with their economic development and the
                    political rivalries between the UMMA Party and the National Unity Party. Not too
                    long after my arrival, the military conducted a coup de etat with General Aboud
                    becoming the President. My friends belonged to the established political
                    parties; such as Sadiq al Mahdi - the grandson of the President of the Sudan who
                    was in office when I arrived in Khartoum and who was the posthumous son of the
                    first Mahdi who had defeated Gordon and freed the country for a brief period
                    from the Ottoman and the British, who became a very close friend. President al
                    Mahdi was a very impressive man. One day, his grandson, Sadiq, came to me - this
                    must have been early in 1960 - telling me that we Americans had to assist in
                    getting rid of General Aboud. I told him that in the first place, as a matter of
                    principal, the U.S. does not take that kind of action to interfere in internal
                    affairs. That statement brought a wry smile to his face. I then asked him what
                    planning he had done if Aboud were to be removed: who would take his place, what
                    kind of government, which individuals, etc. He said he had done no planning. I
                    said that after he had completed that task he should come back and we could
                    perhaps talk again.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>When I left the Political Section, and returned for an assignment in Washington,
                    I was replaced by a CIA officer under Foreign Service cover. I found out very
                    soon that my contacts with the al Mahdi family had been taken over by my
                    replacement and the Station Chief. I was concerned not so much that my
                    replacement had picked up some of my contacts, but that his boss, the CIA
                    Station Chief, had done so. I thought that was inappropriate because my contacts
                    were overt, had nothing to do with CIA interests in the Sudan, and was with
                    individuals already friendly to the U.S.. Why get the CIA involved? Those were
                    the days when CIA was very operational and very competitive with the Department
                    of State. CIA operations in the Sudan led to many misfortunes for the
                    latter.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I still vividly remember when I went back to Khartoum on a visit in March, 1967
                    returning from a tour in Saigon. I stayed in Khartoum for about five days
                    renewing acquaintances. The then President, whom I had known when he was the
                    President of the National Unity Party, received me with open arms; he and my
                    other friends seemed very glad to see me. Strangely, the only person who would
                    not see me was the then Prime Minister, Sadiq al Mahdi. I found out that this
                    refusal was apparently due to the fact the Station Chief didn't want him to see
                    me. All my Sudanese friends told me that it was the Station Chief who was
                    running the Embassy. I asked how they knew that he was a CIA official and was
                    told that it was an open secret. Everyone also knew about his very close
                    contacts with the Prime Minister. My friends, who had worked diligently and
                    consciously in getting rid of General Aboud and had supported Sadiq al Mahdi for
                    the Prime Ministership, were very disillusioned. Many of them hoped for a return
                    of the military because they found that he was not doing what they had expected
                    of him; in fact, the Sudan was in bad shape. I mentioned this to the Ambassador
                    who pointed out that I had attended a staff meeting that morning when the
                    Station Chief and others said that all was going extremely well in the Sudan. I
                    was staying with Cleo Noel, the DCM, who had been in the Political Section at
                    the same time I was in 1960. I told him that my contacts were saying that the
                    Embassy had lost touch with a lot of key Sudanese and were speculating that the
                    Sudanese government would collapse soon and be replaced by a military
                    dictatorship. Although my friends certainly did not support military rule, under
                    the circumstances existing in early 1967, they thought it would be better than
                    the civilian regime then in power. Cleo said that he was happy to hear what I
                    had to say because he thought that he was the only one who was seeing the
                    situation as I had described it. I had told Ambassador Weathersby the same
                    things I had told Cleo, but it didn't have any impact. Six weeks later, Sadiq
                    was overthrown. That was followed by the Six Day war and the U.S.-Israel
                    relationship then became a very sensitive issue in the Sudan. Ambassador
                    Weathersby was asked to leave and the Sudan broke diplomatic relations with the
                    U.S. in June, 1967. Furthermore, the Sadiq-CIA relationships became public.
                    Sadiq's wife Sarah - whom we had earlier arranged to come to the United States
                    with a college fellowship - went to Cleo, who was then the senior U.S.
                    representative in Khartoum and asked that the U.S. provide assistance to get her
                    husband out of the Sudan. She considered him in mortal danger because of his
                    association with the U.S. government. Cleo was not in a position to help. There
                    was absolutely no reason for the CIA to take over the contacts with the al Mahdi
                    family to begin with. Any sensible judgement would have concluded that putting
                    the Prime Minister on our payroll was just an invitation for trouble and totally
                    unnecessary; he would probably follow our general policy line in any case, but
                    by putting him on the CIA payroll we corrupted him politically and made him
                    extremely vulnerable. In the final analysis, the al Mahdi family and the U.S.
                    paid a harsh price which was completely unnecessary.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I saw the same phenomenon when in 1974 I traveled with Joe Sisco to Greece during
                    the limited war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. I saw how the CIA had
                    managed to get itself deeply involved in domestic politics there, and Ambassador
                    Tasca was almost completely captured by the Station Chief. In the 1960s and
                    1970s, the CIA became over-entangled in country's domestic affairs apparently
                    because the CIA saw it as an opportunity in its bureaucratic battles in
                    Washington. I remember when I returned from the Sudan in 1967, I went out to the
                    CIA headquarters to see my old friend, Rufus Taylor - my boss during my Navy
                    service. By then, he had become the Deputy Director of the Agency. We discussed
                    the Sudan situation; I was curious about what CIA thought it was doing in
                    Khartoum. I told him that it made no sense for the Prime Minister to be on the
                    Agency's payroll - it was counter-productive for the Agency and more importantly
                    for the U.S.. Taylor said that he didn't know anything about it. He asked for
                    the file to be brought to his office and read it while I was sitting in his
                    office. After a while, he looked at me and said; “How did you know all this?
                    This information is supposedly very closely held”. I told him that my
                    information had come from Sudanese; not from Americans. He was absolutely
                    astonished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960, you were assigned back to Washington. What was
                        your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was assigned to the Office of UN Political Affairs in the Bureau for
                    International Affairs (IO). I didn't have the slightest idea what I would be
                    doing. Before leaving Khartoum, I had asked Ambassador Moose what I should do
                    about this assignment given to me by the Department. That is when he described
                    the personnel process which I mentioned earlier and talked about what you know,
                    who you know and luck. He thought that Washington was a good place to develop
                    contacts and for people to get to know me. He suggested that I take the
                    assignment, which I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I worked for Bill Buffum and Joe Sisco. I enjoyed it tremendously and think I did
                    a fairly good job. This assignment was very helpful to my future career. The
                    Kennedy administration had just come to power and took the United Nations very
                    seriously. Harland Cleveland became the Assistant Secretary for IO; he had
                    direct access to the White House as well as to Secretary Rusk, and relied
                    heavily upon Joe Sisco and Bill Buffum. The UN was viewed as a serious
                    organization; votes in the General Assembly were a matter of great concern to
                    the administration, not to mention the activities of the Security Council. The
                    UN was used as a primary vehicle for implementation of U.S. policy even
                    internally. For example, if the State Department wanted to do something in the
                    foreign policy area, it could sponsor a General Assembly resolution to force a
                    policy decision. The easiest thing in a bureaucracy is to duck a decision.
                    However, during my tour in IO, I observed that when a vote was to be taken on a
                    GA resolution, an active bureau such as IO under the Cleveland/Sisco leadership,
                    could significantly influence policy, as could the Department of State. If the
                    issue were managed skillfully after a decision was taken, such decisions led to
                    an enhanced role for the UN. The fact that there would be a vote taken in the GA
                    was taken very seriously by the Kennedy administration. Not only would this
                    process bring forth the U.S. position, but it would also stimulate our Foreign
                    Service to lobby for the U.S. position in capitals around the world. That didn't
                    mean that the U.S. automatically followed GA resolutions with which we didn't
                    agree, but we worked hard to push through resolutions that we favored. We tried
                    to be consistent so that our overall policies were consonant with our votes in
                    the UN; the Kennedy administration did not ignore the UN and its resolutions as
                    many later administrations have done. During the Bush and Clinton
                    Administrations, the U.S., I believe, returned to the view that the UN is an
                    important institution, although the emphasis has been on the Security Council
                    and not so much on the GA. But in the late 1950s and 1960s, our positions in the
                    Security Council were always subject to Soviet vetoes, so that the Kennedy
                    administration tended to lean on the GA for support.</p>
                <p>The major UN decision that was reached while I worked in IO dealt with the Congo
                    - now Zaire. I became personally involved in that issue, working with the
                    African experts in the Department. At one critical point, [G. Mennen] Soapy
                    Williams, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, was looking for guidance
                    on our policy in the Congo including what position we would take in the UN. The
                    immediate question was whether troops would be used in Katanga. He was raising
                    these questions in a large meeting at the State Department while Cleveland was
                    at the White House having a one-on-one breakfast with the President, to get
                    decisions on these issues. Cleveland returned to the Department with the
                    decision that the UN could use force. Williams was so far “out of the loop” that
                    he had no knowledge of what was going on. This reflected in part the vigor and
                    drive that IO exhibited under Cleveland, Buffum and Sisco; they saw the UN as a
                    way of forcing and getting support for U.S. policy positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We were judicious on those days in selecting which countries to lobby for
                    support. We didn't approach every country for support on every position, but
                    selected our targets carefully. We stressed the important countries on such
                    issues as Chinese representation, which was an extremely important and
                    contentious issue. I was in New York on detail during the consideration of this
                    issue, serving as liaison with African countries. My assignment, and that of my
                    colleagues, was to make sure that the African delegates and those from other
                    regions actually attended the GA session while important debates on China were
                    going on and that they understood that their instructions from their capitals
                    were to support the U.S. position. Sometimes, we had to pull them out of the
                    delegates' lounge or out of a bar because some of them didn't want to cast such
                    an unpopular vote. This reluctance was even truer for the Latin American
                    representatives than it was for the African ones; we would approach the
                    reluctant ones and tell them that we knew what their instructions were and that
                    we expected them to carry them out. On occasions, we had to be very heavy
                    handed; often their predilections were to vote against us and we had to twist
                    arms forcefully. The State Department later devised a system of rating countries
                    according to their UN votes, whether they were for us or for the USSR. We
                    compared how countries voted to how we voted and the Soviets had voted on
                    perhaps twenty-five key issues. That became a sort of score-card which was used
                    to judge whether foreign assistance and how much might be given to a particular
                    country. That simplistic score card was an over-emphasis on the importance of UN
                    votes as an indicator of a foreign country's support of us.</p>
                <p>I worked with Virginia Hartley, who had been with our delegation at San Francisco
                    when the UN charter was approved, and had been in IO ever since. Unfortunately,
                    today we don't have such institutional memories or people with such considerable
                    UN experience. That becomes a problem when the delegation changes every two or
                    three years. But in the early 1960s, we had a few people who had been around for
                    a long time and they were absolutely invaluable. Unfortunately, their advice was
                    not always heeded and that often ended us up with problems. I remember Virginia
                    Hartley arguing against one of Cleveland's wishes to push for the ouster of the
                    Soviet Union from the UN. The International Court of Justice ruled that the
                    Soviets had to pay their share of the peace-keeping operations even though they
                    were supposed to be voluntary contributions.</p>
                <p>Of course today, the situation is reversed. The Russians are current on their UN
                    contributions and we are the ones that are very delinquent. If we had paid
                    attention to Hartley, we would not now be embarrassed by the precedent set in
                    the 1960s. It was a real boon to have “old hands” available.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>In IO, Buffum played the “institutional memory” role. He had all the facts and
                    history. Joe Sisco was the operator; he could smell out a developing policy
                    issue before anyone else. So he would have a thoughtful, detailed memo on
                    Cleveland's desk concerning the handling of the upcoming issue before anyone
                    else knew that it was even coming up. When that issue would come to a crisis
                    point and when the Secretary would turn for advice, there was Cleveland, with
                    memo in hand, suggesting what actions should be taken. Of course, that memo
                    always proposed the involvement of the UN in one way or another. Ironically, one
                    of Joe's first acts when he became Assistant Secretary for NEA, was to minimize
                    the involvement of the UN in the Middle East. One of the reasons, I think, that
                    he moved from IO to NEA was because he had squeezed all the bureaucratic
                    leverage he could out of the UN, at least as far as Middle East affairs were
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>Joe Sisco was a superb Washington operator - one, if not the best, that I have
                    ever seen. Cleveland took full advantage of Joe's capabilities, even though he
                    had a direct connection with President Kennedy. He understood the value of the
                    UN as an institution and its value to him and IO in proposing solutions to a
                    variety of policy issues. Sisco was also smart enough to recruit some of the
                    best talent in town. He spent many, many hours looking through personnel
                    folders, looking just for the right person for any vacancy that might be
                    occurring in his office. He invariably recruited good staff, which would be
                    responsive to his demands for papers when he sensed a policy issue arising. So
                    he and his staff were always ready to be players in the policy development
                    process. Joe's efforts made Cleveland and all of IO look good. Joe's keen
                    antenna was a hall-mark of his actions; he was always ready whether he was in IO
                    or NEA or the Undersecretary for Political Affairs under Kissinger. He always
                    had high quality analysis and recommendations ready whenever his bosses wanted
                    them.</p>
                <p>Harland Cleveland gave Sisco full support. I think I have already given the best
                    illustration of this Cleveland/Sisco strategy; while “Soapy” Williams thought he
                    was in charge of African policy, in fact, the most important issue of the day -
                    the Congo - was handled by IO. The desk officers in AF [African Affairs] would
                    prepare all the texts of messages and speeches, get them typed, but the name of
                    the “drafting” and “approving” officer were left blank. When these documents
                    were brought to the Office of UN Political Affairs, we would add an IO name as
                    “drafting” officer and Cleveland or Sisco as “approving”. This was the only way
                    that the AF officers could get anything sensible out of their own Bureau.</p>

                <p>The Congo became the first major battleground between the U.S. and the Soviet
                    Union in Africa. It was therefore viewed by all as a major Cold War issue. The
                    U.S. was able to get its way by pushing the UN to enter the conflict and support
                    what today might be termed the “moderate leadership” of the Congo; that also
                    meant the removal of [Patrice] Lumumba, whom we viewed as a Soviet and Chinese
                    puppet, a challenge and a threat to the U.S.. We did not see him as the
                    nationalist leader as he liked to portray himself. With our help, UN Secretary
                    General Hammarskjold and Under Secretary General Ralph Bunche did intervene:
                    they took the kind of action that many would have liked to see today in the
                    former Yugoslavia and Somalia. But I think nations have come to understand that
                    interventions of the kind that the UN undertook in the Congo can be very tricky
                    politically and militarily, and must be handled with great skill. Today, the
                    nations are again shying away from those actions because of disappointments and
                    difficulties in Somalia, Bosnia and Cambodia. In any case, The Congo became
                    stable - more or less. Mobutu began to emerge from behind the scene; no one
                    realized at the time what kind of leader he would become. One of his main assets
                    was always that he has been a staunch anti-communist, but with the end of the
                    Cold War, it was no longer enough. Tshombe, on the other hand, was not one of
                    our favorite leaders. We did not share the view of the Belgian government which
                    was driven by its commercial interests. We were trying to be both
                    anti-colonialist and anti-communist; that meant that we had to look for other
                    leaders besides Tshombe, such as Adoula, a young man when his country became
                    independent who suddenly emerged as the President of the Congo in 1962-63. There
                    is a wonderful story connected with that event that has been mentioned before
                    that I would like to repeat. Frank Carlucci had befriended young Adoula in
                    1959-60 when he was a member of the Parliament. In 1963 Frank was one of the
                    desk officers for The Congo. Adoula camto visit the U.S. after the defeat of
                    Lumumba. That was considered a great triumph because he was viewed as very
                    pro-American, who had brought stability to his country while driving the
                    communists out at the same time. So we had a perfect situation which met both
                    our anti-colonial and anti-communists predilections. Adoula was given a State
                    Dinner at the White House during which he looked around the room and then turned
                    to President Kennedy, who was sitting next to him and asked: “Where is Frank
                    Carlucci?” That inquiry eventually reached Secretary Rusk's ear who summoned
                    Carlucci from the Blair House where he was keeping company with the more junior
                    members of the Congolese delegation. Carlucci was given the seat between Kennedy
                    and Adoula so that he could serve as the interpreter for the rest of the
                    evening. That was the beginning of Carlucci's meteoric rise! Frank turned out to
                    be a good friend of our new hero, the Congolese President, whom he had known
                    when he was only a Congolese Senator.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I should mention that at this time, the UN had a very good staff. Brian Urquhart
                    and Ralph Bunche were in charge of the political side of the UN and they were
                    very careful about their staff recruitment. Dag Hammarskjold was the Secretary
                    General, who was succeeded by U Thant, who wasn't quite as able as his
                    predecessor, although I think did a quite acceptable job. The staffing gradually
                    began to deteriorate later. But in my time, the UN Secretariat was well staffed.
                    That was due in part to the general world acceptance that the UN was an
                    important instrument for world order; that meant that almost every country sent
                    some of its best diplomatic talent to staff its missions in NY. We certainly
                    were well represented by such people as Adlai Stevenson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the IO in 1963 and were assigned to the Ivory
                        Coast. Hodid that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was the system that sent me to the Ivory Coast. I did not ask for the
                    assignment. Joe Sisco had asked me to stay with him for a third year which I was
                    happy to do. Then it was time for me to move on and personnel knew that I was a
                    French language officer. An opening became available as Economic officer in
                    Abidjan and off I went. My wife, two children - ages 1 and 2 - and I all moved
                    to the Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>The 1963-65 period was a fascinating one in the Ivory Coast because it found
                    itself right in the middle of the Cold War. It was surrounded by Socialists
                    close to the west and China: Sekou Toure in Guinea, Modibu Keita in Mali and
                    Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana - all left-leaning leaders, very actively supported by
                    both the Chinese and the Soviets. These neighbors plus their communist backers
                    were engaged in subverting the Ivory Coast government through propaganda and
                    other activities because that country was perceived as the Western capitalistic
                    bastion in West Africa. James Wine from Kentucky was our ambassador in Abidjan.
                    He was a political appointee who had been a Kennedy campaign worker - he was a
                    tremendous help to Kennedy in building bridges to the Protestant vote; he was
                    close to Averell Harriman. Phyllis and I made a lot of good friends in the Ivory
                    Coast and enjoyed our social life there immensely. The beach was great!
                    Professionally, it changed my expectations. This assignment enabled me to
                    clearly notice and begin to understand the inter-relationship between political
                    and economic affairs. It was clear that economic development had a major direct
                    impact on political growth.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The U.S. faced a critical decision soon after I arrived in Ivory Coast. The
                    international coffee cartel was strong; it held to a rigid quota system. The
                    U.S. was the world's largest consumer of coffee and Brazil was the major
                    producer, but the Ivory Coast was increasing its coffee production. In 1964, the
                    Ivory Coat had a bumper crop, the world's second or third producer, just as
                    prices were reaching a peak level. President Houphouet-Boigny had been a coffee
                    grower himself and had risen the political ladder based on his success as a
                    coffee grower and his ability as an organizer of other coffee planters. He
                    started his political career as an opponent of the French, although in later
                    years, he became France's best friend in Africa. He was in the forefront before
                    1960 of the drive to gain autonomy but not independence for the Ivory Coast.
                    When he became a leader of his country, Houphouet never forgot his roots and the
                    support that the small coffee grower had always given him. These people owned
                    only ten acres or less, but there were hundreds of thousands of them, making
                    them a powerful political force. The Ivory Coast government therefore always set
                    a very high producer price for coffee and cocoa, bringing cash to the
                    countryside, further empowering that sector politically.</p>
                <p>The crisis in 1963-64 arose when the Ivory Coast production greatly exceeded its
                    quota as set by the International Coffee Producers Association. This presented
                    the government with a major dilemma: high production and prices and a low sales
                    quota. If it would have to purchase all that coffee and cocoa for local storage,
                    unable to sell it in world markets, the government's budget deficit would fall
                    out of sight. That would have a devastating effect on the economy. The
                    Department of State in Washington did not see any answer to the Ivory Coast's
                    dilemma despite our cables and reports.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I became greatly concerned by the consequences of this confluence of events and
                    the Ambassador came to see the problem, as well. He understood the importance of
                    maintaining a stable Ivory Coast in light of the ambitions of its neighbors. He
                    and I worked on a letter that he sent to his friend, Harriman, then the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs. Harriman took the letter to the White House and
                    was able to arrange for a one-time loan waiver of the Ivory Coast coffee import
                    quota, allowing it to sell that extra coffee. That one action made a major
                    difference in the Ivory Coast's long-term economic and political future; it was
                    able to export its coffee and dollars came flowing into its economy; it was a
                    real boon because, as I said, prices were at their peak at this time. The cash
                    went into the countryside and not into the bank accounts of a few rich, well
                    placed people - bureaucrats and businessmen - as so often happens. Tens of
                    thousands of people came from Guinea, Mali and Ghana to seek work in the Ivory
                    Coast, either on plantations or on the docks where imports were coming in, or on
                    the roads that were being built, or as labor on the coffee and cocoa farms. The
                    proceeds from exports plus economic assistance from France and the U.S. gave the
                    Ivory Coast an opportunity to engage in serious economic development. That made
                    the 1963-65 period an illustration of a single U.S. decision having a major long
                    lasting effect on the future of another country. It became a key decision for
                    the political configuration of West Africa of the strength between West and
                    East, as well. As the Ivory Coast became economically stronger, the pressures
                    from its neighbors collapsed. Their citizens, having worked in the Ivory Coast,
                    understood the advantages of a free market economy compared to the system that
                    their leaders were trying to sell to them. Within ten years, the Communist
                    leaders of Mali, Guinea and Ghana were all overthrown, and the idea of socialism
                    totally discredited. The loss of Soviet influence was equally evident.</p>
                <p>I should also note that the presence of a well-connected political ambassador was
                    very useful in this series of events. Although Wine had not been one of the
                    major players in the campaign, he did have important political contacts in
                    Washington who helped him to carry the day. I don't think that a professional
                    ambassador, good as he may have been, could have managed to have the coffee
                    quota issue raised in the White House because all he would have had to depend on
                    would have been the regular communication channels of the Department. We in
                    Abidjan had tried those channels which were entirely unresponsive. It took
                    Wine's personal letter to Harriman to get the appropriate and necessary
                    Washington action. The State bureaucracy never did fully understand the
                    political import of providing relief to the Ivory Coast in the context of its
                    rivalry with its three communist neighbors. Furthermore, the bureaucracy did not
                    know how to obtain a quota increase which required a Presidential waiver.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I should note that while Wine was working his personal channels, the U.S.
                    assistance agency was working on establishing an Ivory Coast Development Bank.
                    That was a very welcome step by the Ivory Coast because it saw it as a very
                    useful institution to encourage foreign investment which would accelerate its
                    economic development. But we, in establishing this bank, paid very little
                    attention to the average Ivory Coast citizen, nor did the Ivory Coast government
                    try to do that, even the representatives of its own business community. Sekou
                    Toure in Guinea insisted that the investments all be indigenous - not foreign.
                    By taking this “politically correct” line, I think he destroyed Guinea's
                    economy. Houphouet went in the opposite direction pushing for maximum economic
                    development in the shortest possible time relying upon foreign investment. But
                    in doing so, he paid scant attention to the development of his own people and
                    did not try to engage them further in economic development. That led Ambassador
                    Wine and me to the conclusion that the new bank should have a loan capacity for
                    local small business people; it was to provide capital resources as well as
                    human resources - accountants, etc. - to assist in the establishment and
                    development of the small business sector of the Ivory Coast. I can't say that my
                    AID assistance colleagues were very happy with this concept; they insisted that
                    they had already reached agreement of the bank with the Ivory Coast government.
                    We pointed out to them that they had forgotten to talk to the Embassy about
                    their program before talking to the host government. Finally, Wine had to tell
                    the assistance agency that if it insisted in pursuing its program without our
                    modification, he would have to appear before Congress and express his serious
                    reservations. That changed the program quickly and a small business component
                    was added to the development bank. A few years later, I read that the Ivory
                    Coast was pointing to this new program for the small business man as a model
                    that all of Africa should emulate. Once again, this was an illustration of the
                    power a political appointee can have to push through the ideas of the staff if
                    he or she is willing to use leverage and take a few risks. Wine was not a
                    special ambassador, but he did have a good deal of common sense and was willing
                    to stick his neck out.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The French felt that the Ivory Coast was their province; that caused many
                    tensions between us. We took a more liberal approach, particularly in economic
                    development which by its very nature was bound to make the new country more and
                    more independent of France. So we always had a struggle with the French. It was
                    just one more area of continuing French-U.S. tensions that have always existed
                    and are still with us today. I had many contacts with French representatives in
                    Abidjan, but clearly we were going in different directions. I remember that we
                    had serious differences on how to handle the Congo. By now, Tshombe had become
                    Prime Minister. The Ivory Coast was instrumental in providing him support.
                    Tshombe came to a meeting of the West African countries which was being held in
                    Abidjan, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian ambassador. That ambassador had a
                    reputation which had preceded him to Abidjan. He came from a very wealthy,
                    aristocratic Belgian family. He was a great lover of African women - literally
                    speaking. His wife did not come to the post with him giving him opportunities to
                    gather intelligence in a very undiplomatic fashion. He was very successful at
                    that having more “inside” information than all other ambassadors. He also had
                    better access to the President - through his liaisons - than the French
                    Ambassador, who was always very frustrated by that situation. One day, I went to
                    see the Belgian Ambassador to discuss something about the Congo. Before our
                    discussion started, he was on the telephone, but he threw me some photographs
                    which he said I might be interested in seeing. They were pictures of him and
                    some of his “ladies”; I must say that he had exquisite taste in women.</p>
                <p>At one point, I remember the Italian Ambassador who lived right next door - by
                    this time I had been promoted to be the Political Counselor and therefore was
                    living in better quarters - invited Phyllis and me to dinner. The evening was
                    going along very smoothly until we were all invited into the dining room. All of
                    a sudden, a great chill came over the party of 14-16 people; conversation
                    stopped. The Italians and the Belgians had refused to accept the French
                    Ambassador as the automatic Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, even though the Ivory
                    Coast had agreed to that as part of their independence agreement. The Italian
                    Ambassador had placed his Belgian counterpart in the place of honor - to the
                    right of the hostess. The French Ambassador was supposed to be seated on the
                    hostess' left. But the French Ambassador, always alert to such slights, had
                    sneaked into the dining room before the guests had entered and had switched the
                    name cards so that he would be seated to the right of the hostess. He then
                    entered the dining room first and sat where he had put his name card. Almost all
                    of the guest of course guessed what had happened and then no one spoke another
                    word to the French Ambassador for the rest of the evening. That gives you some
                    of the flavor of the diplomatic community of Abidjan in the 1963-65 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The French had always exacted a deal from the Ivory Coast which required that 50%
                    of all tracked vehicles imported into the Ivory Coast would be bought from
                    France. Some French businessmen, who were involved in logging and construction,
                    signed a petition to the French Ambassador saying that they didn't want French
                    equipment because it was inferior to other manufacturers. They wanted the quota
                    removed so that they could procure from Caterpillar. The U.S. assistance agency
                    was providing approximately $15 million for purchase of heavy equipment for
                    highway construction. The lowest bidder was another American bulldozer
                    manufacturer. But the Ivory Coast government refused to accept the bid; it
                    wanted Caterpillar equipment because it felt that it was of higher quality and
                    had lower maintenance costs. The assistance mission pointed out that the other
                    bidder was the lowest, but the Ivory Coast government insisted that over a ten
                    year period, the Caterpillar would prove to be a better purchase. Our assistance
                    people eventually went along with the Ivory Coast which was just as well because
                    the lowest bidder went out of business the following year.</p>
                <p>I should say a word about what American interests in the Ivory Coast were, as we
                    saw them in Abidjan. We understood that it was not our role to replace the
                    French, but to serve as a supplement to them and in some cases to serve as a
                    prodder in a effort to get them to change some of their policies. We were in the
                    Ivory Coast to fill in some of the niches that the French were leaving, such as,
                    for example, assistance to small businessmen, that I have referred to before.
                    The French were not very supportive of our efforts because they were concerned
                    that such assistance might have a negative impact on the large French monopoly
                    corporations that were operating in the Ivory Coast. But essentially, we were in
                    the Ivory Coast to supplement French efforts and thereby provide support to
                    efforts that we believed would be beneficial to everyone in the long run. That
                    was our general policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Occasionally, we would try to support the Ivory Coast on a major economic
                    problem, as we did in the coffee quota issue that I described earlier. We also
                    bolstered the government in its contest with its pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese
                    neighbors. In the period we were discussing we were fortunate that
                    Houphouet-Boigny was a very good President. We wished that he would have spent a
                    few more resources developing the country's human capital, but in general we
                    found him very helpful. He insisted on rigor in economic development - i.e. no
                    corruption was allowed, the funds went into a development budget and not towards
                    supporting a lavish life style for himself or other high ranking officials. He
                    did have a large palace, but at that point, it was not an issue. There were some
                    indications that this stable situation might change. For example, the planning
                    for Yamoussoukro - the future grandiose capital of the country - was beginning.
                    But it in 1963-65, this was not seen as a major threat to a very rigorous and
                    disciplined economic development program that the Ivory Coast was pursuing.
                    There is no question that Houphouet was not a “democrat”; he was authoritarian
                    and somewhat paranoid. In the African tradition, the country had only a single
                    party and the President did not tolerate much dissent within that party. There
                    were “elections” but they were pretty well pre-ordained. Houphouet really
                    concentrated on economic development, giving no attention to political growth.
                    His economic policies enabled him to build a solid base in the Ivory Coast, but
                    after 1970, the rigor of the economic development system became frayed and
                    corruption began to take its toll. The economy of the country began to collapse
                    because the controls over expenditures collapsed and the Ivory Coast lapsed
                    intoan economic malaise that occurs too often in “Third World” countries.</p>
                <p>Unlike its operations in the Sudan, the CIA station in the Ivory Coast played a
                    very positive role. Its focus was primarily on events in Mali, Guinea and Ghana
                    and its intelligence collection efforts were very helpful. While I was in the
                    Ivory Coast, Jack Matlock arrived in Ghana, assigned as the political officer to
                    our Embassy in Accra. Matlock was even then a Soviet expert and later became our
                    Ambassador in Moscow. Jack looked at Nkrumah and his cohorts through the eyes of
                    a Soviet specialist. His analysis was that what he saw was not “African
                    socialism”, but rather essentially a Soviet sponsored communist clique that had
                    captured Nkrumah. His reports were well considered and convincing. William
                    Mahoney, our Ambassador in Accra, also a political appointee, fully supported
                    Matlock; between the two of them, they made a sufficiently strong case that
                    brought a complete reversal of U.S. attitude toward Nkrumah and Ghana.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Under Secretary of State Averell Harriman visited Accra on a couple of occasions
                    in an effort to bypass the clique around Nkrumah and talk to him directly, but
                    he failed. So the U.S. concluded that Nkrumah was not worthy of our support and
                    we used our influence with the World Bank and other donors to cut Ghana off from
                    any economic assistance. That termination of assistance in addition to the
                    already poor performance of the Ghanian economy, stemming from the
                    nationalization of their major export productions - coffee and cocoa - led to
                    the collapse of the Nkrumah regime. That event was also helped by the good
                    performance of the Ivory Coast which was so evident to all Ghanaians who worked
                    in or visited that country. I found this change in U.S. policy very interesting
                    because it was based on new insights into a local African situation that a
                    Foreign Service officer, trained in analysis of the Soviet system, brought to
                    his assignment.The Soviets and the Chinese tried to bring their influence to
                    bear in the Ivory Coast as well, but they were not successful. On one occasion,
                    a group of communist rebels were intercepted as they were trying to infiltrate
                    from Mali. CIA sent one of its agents to assist in the interrogation of the
                    captured. These infiltrators had originally come from the Ivory Coast, but had
                    left the country for one reason or another. They had been brought together in
                    Mali, from where they were sent to the Soviet Union and China for training in
                    propaganda and armed subversion. Then they had been brought back to Mali to
                    infiltrate the Ivory Coast. When they entered the Ivory Coast, they brought
                    their classroom note books with them, which made for a rich intelligence
                    collection for the CIA. The Station then assisted the Ivory Coast in preparing a
                    “white” paper about the perfidies of the communist powers which was widely
                    circulated in West Africa. This is how the CIA operated with its host. The
                    Station Chief was Robert Whittenhill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1965, you were assigned to Saigon. How were you so
                        lucky?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was totally unexpected. In the first place, I was a French language
                    officer. Secondly, Cleo Noel was the Personnel Officer responsible for staffing
                    of Far East posts. We had talked in 1964 and he asked me whether I was looking
                    for something different outside of Africa. In fact, I was getting a little tired
                    of African Affairs, having spent a lot of time on its issues. Cleo suggested
                    that I look to Vietnam where he felt there were some very interesting jobs. This
                    was just at the beginning of our major involvement in that country. So I
                    consulted Phyllis and she was willing to go. That was supposed to take the
                    Oakley family to Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>However, between the time the assignment was made and my departure, the security
                    situation in Saigon changed dramatically. Families were no longer allowed to
                    accompany official personnel. Phyllis was greatly displeased by this turn of
                    events, but we finally agreed that the best thing for her and the children would
                    be to for them to go to Shreveport, LA, where I had grown up and where I had a
                    lot of friends. But it was a strange place for her. Those two years of
                    separation - the first in our married life - were not particularly enjoyable for
                    her or me. But we were sufficiently impressed by the fact that our soldiers were
                    actually risking their lives in Vietnam and could not see any way around the
                    moral dilemma that my refusal to go to Saigon would have created. I would not be
                    subjected to physical danger unlike our soldiers; they too were separated from
                    their families and we didn't see how I could now seek another assignment with a
                    clear conscience. We weren't happy with the prospect of separation, but felt
                    that it was part of a Foreign Service career commitment. Fortunately for all of
                    us, my best friend from childhood, Stanton Dossett, and his wife and children
                    lived across the street from Phyllis and Tom and Mary. They probably saved
                    Phyllis' family and my marriage.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Saigon, I became one of Phil Habib's “boys” - a member of a 26
                    man Political Section. That was an experience! I was first assigned to work with
                    John Burke on internal political affairs; we were part of the Embassy's
                    Political Section under Phil Habib. Someone should write up the history of that
                    section; it was absolutely extraordinary. Dave Lambertson, Dick Teare, John
                    Negroponte, Paul Hare, Bill Marsh, Tom Corcoran, Bob Miller, John Burke, Freeman
                    Matthews, Richard Smyser, and Ken Quinn were all members of the section at the
                    time; most of them rose to be ambassadors. They were outstanding in their
                    knowledge of Vietnam, SE Asia, and Asia generally, and also innovative,
                    intellectually curious and excellent at interpersonal relations. Dick Holbrooke
                    and Frank Wisner were working as special assistants to Ambassadors Lodge and
                    Porter, but were really part of Phil's group. The section included a special
                    section of language officers who reported on activities in the provinces; they
                    went out in the countryside for 2-3 weeks at a time to get first-hand views of
                    the situation and then came back to write up their reports. These collected
                    reports provided the most accurate information of activities and trends in the
                    countryside. Too bad they were largely ignored at the policy level in
                    Washington. In fact, worse than ignored, they were denounced by agencies other
                    than State that found them too pessimistic. Eventually, the U.S. Pacific Command
                    and the Pentagon succeeded in having the provincial reports stopped and the
                    section disbanded on the spurious grounds that the reporting was too subjective.
                    They were replaced with a new, objective measure of the situation in the
                    countryside, which came to be called the Hamlet Evaluation Program. Everyone
                    recalls that it measured the provinces as over 95 percent secure and stable just
                    before the Tet Offensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Our living conditions in those days were very good. We lived in a compound of
                    five houses; Habib, naturally, occupied the one in the middle and his acolytes
                    lived around him. The security situation was well in hand and didn't have any
                    fears for our security even though we were not heavily guarded. The Ambassador
                    was Henry Cabot Lodge - his second tour. The Deputy Ambassador was Bill Porter -
                    in addition to his DCM duties, he was also the head of CORDS (a program to try
                    to stabilize the provinces with assistance). I found my assignment fascinating -
                    very exciting. My work was on internal Vietnamese political affairs. I got to
                    Saigon shortly after the old Embassy had been blown up and left just before the
                    new one suffered the same fate. Fortunately, the old building had been repaired
                    by the time I arrived.</p>
                <p>As I said, I worked on matters relating to the political situation in Saigon. I
                    was supposed to try to understand and analyze South Vietnamese politics. Before
                    my arrival, there was a period of “rolling coups.” - that is one government
                    after another. My job also included working with the U.S. military to try to
                    understand the political role of the Vietnamese military. They had a tremendous
                    amount of political information but did not understand it. I remember one day
                    going to MACV - the U.S. military headquarters - to see a couple of generals. I
                    needed some information about some Vietnamese officers which I thought they
                    might have. They met my inquiries with the answer: “But they are involved in
                    military affairs; they have nothing to do with politics. We can't answer your
                    questions and give you any information.” I was pretty sure that the Americans
                    knew, but were not prepared to provide it to me. I think it was clear to many of
                    us that the American military was quite aware of the political activities of
                    their Vietnamese counterparts, but were not ready to share their knowledge with
                    the Embassy. My dealings with the U.S. military were primarily because I was
                    assigned as head of a committee dealing with the Montagnards (tribal people
                    living in the highlands who worked with the U.S.). The committee had on it
                    representatives from the military, CIA and AID. The purpose of the committee was
                    to coordinate all the programs and activities that the U.S. government carried
                    on in support of the Montagnards. That brought me into contact with the U.S.
                    military; tangentially, I had contacts with the military on other issues as
                    well. We worked very diligently on this coordinating committee because we found
                    out that - unconsciously - our Special Forces and the CIA had picked up where
                    the French had left off, treating the Montagnards as a special group, providing
                    assistance and protection far more generously than that received by other
                    indigenous groups; in fact, we protected the Montagnards against the South
                    Vietnamese government. One day, we attended a graduation ceremony at the
                    Montegnard training center, a group trained by the U.S. was ready to go into the
                    field. It was a big event with lots of fanfare and pomp - wives were invited to
                    attend. Ambassador Lodge was there for the U.S..</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>At one moment during the day, we noticed all of a sudden a lot of scurrying
                    around; people bringing messages to Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky. It turned out
                    that a number of Montagnard units had rebelled; they had pillaged a number of
                    South Vietnam towns and had then retreated into the countryside. These units
                    happened to be crack units that we had trained to fight the Vietcong and the
                    North Vietnamese. They had rebelled against their South Vietnamese leadership.
                    When members of one of these units returned to town, they were arrested and put
                    in jail along with a U.S. Army major who was with the Montagnards. The major had
                    been assigned as an advisor to these units and in an act of loyalty decided to
                    go to jail with “his” men to try to protect them from any retribution that the
                    Vietnamese might have wished to mete out. He was upset that the Montagnards had
                    been arrested. Our relationship with the Montagnards had reached the point at
                    which we not only treated them better than other indigenous groups; we in fact
                    sheltered them, just as the French had done.</p>
                <p>The events of that day made me become aware of what was going on generally. I
                    recognized that we had fallen into the same mental trap as the French had and
                    that instead of trying to bring about a rapprochementbetween the Vietnamese
                    government and the Montagnards, we were continuing the policy of separation. We
                    failed to realize that one day we would leave Vietnam and that made it
                    imperative that the Montagnards and the Vietnamese be able to live together. So
                    I took the issue up with Ambassador Lodge and the Embassy leadership. That
                    brought the development of a new U.S. stand vis-a-vis the Montagnards and the
                    establishment of the coordinating committee I chaired. As I suggested, our
                    policy of treating the Montagnards differently from the Vietnamese just
                    developed unconsciously and before we were aware of it, we were following the
                    policies of the French. We did then make the conscious decision to bring the
                    Vietnamese and Montagnards closer together, enabling us to abandon the role of
                    intermediary which we - the U.S. military and the CIA - had unconsciously
                    assumed. These two American agencies had trained the Montagnards, as they were
                    supposed to do, but in the process had become so close to them that they became
                    the protectors thereby perpetuating the French policy of separation. The
                    Montagnards of course did not object to having this special status; they had
                    become accustomed to their role during the French rule of Vietnam. In fact, they
                    really didn't like the Vietnamese; so this separation suited them.</p>
                <p>The internal political situation in Saigon was always full of intrigue. We didn't
                    know as much about what was going on as we should have. That was the main reason
                    that we were continually surprised by a new coup, which as I mentioned had
                    happened frequently in the period preceding my assignment to Saigon. While I was
                    there, Ambassador Lodge received orders from the White House to transform
                    Vietnam into a democracy. Those instructions were passed on to Phil Habib and
                    the Political Section. This seemed highly unrealistic but President Johnson
                    insisted. I worked on that effort, which was an interesting experience. Phil and
                    I along with a professor of political science from Penn State started a joint
                    project with the South Vietnamese government. Our first objective was to write a
                    draft constitution. That was followed by the election of a constituent assembly
                    to ratify the document so as to make it the supreme law of the land. After that,
                    there were presidential elections.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The Embassy trio - Habib, the professor and me - set to work and ended with a
                    Vietnamese version of the U.S. Constitution. It had three separate power
                    centers: the executive, the legislature and a judiciary. The president was to be
                    elected by the Vietnamese voters. When we had finished with our draft, we sent
                    it over to the Constituent Assembly which fiddled around with it. But the “fine
                    tuning” did not change the essence of our draft. I must say that from the outset
                    we did not think that a constitution based on Western principles was likely to
                    work in an Eastern culture. The question for us was not would the new
                    constitution be in effect while the U.S. was present in Vietnam, but what would
                    happen after we left? The concepts underlying the document were alien to the
                    Vietnamese and we did not give them a very great chance of becoming permanent.
                    We did it because we were instructed to do so.</p>
                <p>We then got the word from Washington that the presidential candidates would be
                    General Thieu and Air Marshal Ky. This was somewhat contrary to our hopes. We
                    had hoped that a fine civilian, Mr. Huang, would step up and become a candidate.
                    But Washington felt that we could not afford to take any chances; i.e. we had to
                    stick with those we knew. A new candidate would be unpredictable and Washington
                    didn't want to take any risks. It was satisfied with the status quo and didn't
                    want to rock the boat. We proceeded with elections and a new Constituent
                    Assembly and President were elected. General Thieu was elected President.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I have been asked whether the approach we took to political reform in Vietnam
                    bore any similarity to what General MacArthur did in Japan. We did not really
                    review that experience primarily because the situations were so different. We
                    occupied Japan and we were completely in charge of all governmental functions
                    for a period after WW II. MacArthur had many experts on his staff who could not
                    only develop appropriate legislative approaches, but could also over a period of
                    time correct any processes that seemed ineffective. We in Vietnam, never did
                    quite figure out what our role was. We were not an occupying power; we were
                    allies, but how far did that allow us to interfere with domestic affairs? Were
                    we the “big brothers” with all the responsibilities that that term often
                    connotes? We were in fact ambivalent about our role and the South Vietnamese
                    were not any clearer about this question than we were. I think that in the
                    absence of a clear understanding of our role, the Vietnamese leaders manipulated
                    us to a great extent; we did not ever manage to understand or lead them. Of
                    course, the Vietnamese had had a lot more practice at manipulating Westerners -
                    starting with their former colonial masters. But we created a situation which
                    was neither fish or fowl. We left ourselves open to charges by Vietcong and
                    their Hanoi masters that we were acting just like the French had during their
                    colonial rule. It wasn't true because we never managed to achieve that level of
                    influence because we wanted thVietnamese to maintain a certain amount of
                    sovereignty. So it was a strange situation. The Vietnamese played the “game”
                    because it was obviously to their advantage; they adopted some of the outward
                    attributes of democracy knowing full well that the full concept would never be
                    acceptable to them. Of course, our role in selecting presidential candidates was
                    hardly a model of democracy; the Vietnamese learned that lesson fast. In fact,
                    once the South Vietnamese army leaders made their choice of winner known, that
                    was it; he was elected. We all knew that Thieu was going to win.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Although I am not a cultural anthropologist, it was quite clear to everyone that
                    often we and the Vietnamese talked past each other. For example, I remember the
                    day when several mid-grade Vietnamese Army officers came to see Frank Wisner and
                    myself. Frank at the time was working for Bill Porter. The officers asked us
                    whether we realized what General Westmoreland was about to do. He was going to
                    remove all Vietnamese troops from the front lines; they would be exclusively
                    devoted to the pacification efforts. The front would be manned entirely by
                    American and South Korean troops. These officers pointed out that regardless of
                    our opinion of individual Vietnamese units, such a move on the part of
                    Westmoreland would have a devastating effect on all Vietnamese troops. Their
                    morale and self-image would be completely destroyed; the Americans were in fact
                    saying that the Vietnamese were not good enough to fight their own war, fight
                    for their own country. My answer was that they obviously had misunderstood the
                    import of Westmoreland's concept; he and we felt that pacification was extremely
                    important. Their comment was something along the lines: “For us and our men, it
                    is the garbage detail!” One of the officer pointed out that he had been a
                    regimental commander in an airborne division; he was then the chief of staff to
                    Minister of Defense Co - who by the way was a complete crook. He said that the
                    airborne men had a tremendous amount of pride; he thought that the airborne
                    troops were still very good. There were other units that were mediocre and some
                    that were poor, but he was sure that if Westmoreland followed though on his
                    plans, all the South Vietnamese troops would end up being poor. There wouldn't
                    be any left to fight. Frank Wisner and I understood the Vietnamese anxieties and
                    agreed with them. We got Habib to support us. He got Ambassador Lodge to see
                    Westmoreland and held a long meeting with him. At the end, Westmoreland said: “I
                    am in charge of military operations in Vietnam. This is a military issue. I have
                    the support of all of the Vietnamese command. End of conversation!” He did not
                    have sufficient feel for Vietnamese “face saving” needs. Of course, later
                    Westmoreland was replaced by General Abrams to “Vietnamize” the conflict, to
                    bring the South Vietnamese army back into the war. That was too late because by
                    that time there were no effective Vietnamese fighting forces left.
                    Westmoreland's move destroyed the morale of the Vietnamese troops so that Abrams
                    had nothing to work with when he arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>This story also illustrates the American command structure in Saigon. On
                    “military” matters, the CINC [Commander-in-Chief] called the shots. The issue of
                    what units would fight where was perceived to be a “military matter.” Habib was
                    frustrated by the situation. We understood that there were very few matters, if
                    any, which were strictly “military.” He and others like myself tried to
                    interject ourselves when we thought that larger political objectives were at
                    stake. We did our job as best we could, recognizing the limitations dictated by
                    the situation. It is true that we managed to force some decisions to the
                    Washington level and that would end the local debate. I should note that
                    episodes such as the one I described seem to have been overlooked by McNamara in
                    his book on Vietnam. I have mentioned CIA. I should note that the relationships
                    between the Political Section and the Station were quite good, although we did
                    not always agree with what they did. On a minor scale, I think they may have
                    been undertaking actions which were not known to Ambassador Lodge, but this was
                    not a major problem. There was one specific problem that we had. As I mentioned
                    earlier, we received word from the White House that either Thieu or Ky would be
                    South Vietnam's next President. The choice of the winner was to be left to the
                    Vietnamese military command. CIA sources maintained that Ky was going to be the
                    winner and so reported to Washington. We in the Political Section maintained
                    that it would be Thieu. John Negroponte was by this time working with me on
                    internal Vietnamese political affairs. We were certain it would be Thieu because
                    he was much more Vietnamese; Ky appeared to be much more western. I had left
                    Saigon by the time the final choice was made, but John told me later that the
                    last report from the CIA - still predicting Ky - was filed just at the time that
                    Ambassador Lodge was called to a meeting with the military command at which he
                    was told that its candidate would be Thieu. CIA had had a very close
                    relationship with Ky for a long time; so they had a bias in his favor which
                    undoubtedly colored their reporting.</p>
                <p>When I left in 1967, I was not optimistic about Vietnam's future. I could not
                    predict the outcome of that struggle, but I was less than sanguine about the
                    possibility of a free South Vietnam - much less a democratic one. I remember one
                    day attending a Westmoreland briefing as the representative of the Embassy. He
                    was talking about building a large military complex in the Delta which would
                    have cost millions and millions. At one moment, he looked at me - as if I were
                    representing the enemy - and said: “If you think this is a waste of money, you
                    are wrong! We will still be using this facility ten years from now.” It was at
                    that moment that I recognized that we had no strategy which would permit us to
                    leave Vietnam under less than panic circumstances. It was inconceivable that any
                    one could seriously believe that we would still have a major presence in Vietnam
                    in ten years. I had a sinking feeling at that moment; the lack of an exit
                    strategy did not bode well for the success of our efforts in Vietnam. Our
                    military command at least and others as well did not have the slightest idea how
                    to bring our involvement in Vietnam to a conclusion. That was a disturbing
                    thought since I was certain that the American public would not support our
                    involvement in Vietnam for anything close to another ten years. I am not sure
                    that it took a rocket scientist to figure that out; I was only a mid-level
                    political officer, but I knew that Westmoreland's statement lacked
                    credibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Joe Alsop came to Saigon at one time. Many of my bosses were in Manila for a high
                    level conference with LBJ. Alsop maintained that a major victory was just around
                    the corner and that we would be leaving South Vietnam in triumph in six months'
                    time. He and I had a very strong argument about that. I told him that I thought
                    he had lost his mind. I may have expressed my doubts a little more vigorously
                    than others, but I don't remember any great feeling of optimism in the Embassy
                    about Vietnam's future. But we had not yet reached the point at which “exit
                    strategies” were not only acceptable, but as is the case today, mandatory. There
                    are some who will maintain that our effort to bring democracy to South Vietnam
                    was in fact an “exit strategy.” If we had been successful and if the concept
                    would have won the “minds and hearts” of the Vietnamese, then perhaps those
                    analysts would have been right. But in fact, beyond writing a new constitution,
                    I don't remember any other efforts made by the U.S. to bring democracy to
                    Vietnam. CORDS may have been thought to have been an effort along those lines,
                    if you believe that bringing better administration is fundamental to democratic
                    development by winning the loyalty of the population and reducing corruption.
                    But I don't think the basic goal of CORDS was to bring democracy to Vietnam; it
                    was designed to bring support to our friends in the government in Saigon. We did
                    have democratization as a political goal, but our implementation efforts were
                    very shallow and superficial. I suppose the Vietnamese themselves could have
                    taken greater advantage of the opportunities for democratization that we would
                    have supported, but when we write the constitution and dictate who should be the
                    candidates for the highest office in the land, it is a little hard to fault the
                    Vietnamese for not taking democratization a little more seriously. Our policy of
                    democracy was not an “exit strategy”; I think it was a cynical move dictated
                    primarily by U.S. domestic politics.</p>
                <p>I might mention a couple of other efforts in which I was personally involved. We
                    tried to establish a youth committee for younger Vietnamese - student leaders,
                    recent graduates. I was personally interested in this project because it related
                    to my interests in trying to do something about the city of Saigon. I spent a
                    lot of time working with the Mayor and other city officials on the subjects
                    related to the administration of Saigon. CORDS and AID focused on the rural
                    areas and other cities besides Saigon. I thought that our target was somewhat
                    misdirected because the real action was in Saigon where the politics was
                    focused, where most of the people were. I thought it imperative that assistance
                    be provided to Saigon because in addition to the problems it had under the
                    French, it was being overwhelmed by a flow of refugees from the countryside. So
                    I managed to get some assistance directed to improving the administration of the
                    city, its public transportation, infrastructure, etc. AID helped us to get some
                    projects going, even though its principal target was still the countryside.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I found a project headed by Charlie Sweet, an AID advisor, to be one of the most
                    intriguing efforts. Together with Frank Wisner and Sweet we were able to get the
                    Vietnamese themselves to establish self-help programs in the Saigon's outlying
                    districts - 6, 7 and 8 - which were filled with refugees. Some of the former
                    student leaders, who had led demonstrations against their government while at
                    university, found a challenge in helping to bring some order to the chaotic
                    situation in those districts. It was a satisfying experience for those young men
                    and women. We worked with them to improve the infrastructure and housing
                    conditions by trucking building materials to these young people in the middle of
                    the night so our help would not be visible. At our request, Lodge issued an
                    order that no Americans were to enter those districts without the explicit
                    approval of his office. That insured that the effort would be seen as entirely
                    Vietnamese. The young people managed to get the refugees to provide the “sweat”
                    labor; they put up the housing. SEABEES would go in at night to lay the concrete
                    slabs - the young people and the refugees didn't have enough skills to do that,
                    but the Vietnamese built the rest of the houses. So it could be and was said
                    that this was a Vietnamese self-help project, which I think was a very important
                    symbol.</p>
                <p>In fact, these self help measures assisted the inhabitants to take the political
                    process into their own hands. In those three district, they held elections and
                    voted for their own municipal officials. That did make the rest of the city
                    officials very uneasy because the representatives of those three districts were
                    not corruptible at all. As I said, most of them were student leaders who were
                    not interested in “feathering their own nests.” That made the others very
                    nervous. They began to wonder what the Americans and the students were doing in
                    these three districts. These new political development came to a crunch when the
                    Tet offensive took place; it was that part of the city that we destroyed to get
                    the Vietcong out of Saigon. That was most unfortunate. It put an end to what was
                    an inspiring, growing project.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I just mention one incident which I believe is instructive for anyone trying to
                    understand our role in Vietnam. On one occasion, a team from the Pentagon and
                    CINCPAC came out. Habib was gone. I was the senior officer in the Political
                    Section at the time. They presented a plan which would have changed the nature
                    and methodology being used by the Provincial Reporting Section of our Office.
                    Negroponte, Teare, Lambertson were part of that staff. Ken Quinn was a member of
                    that section - he just went out as our Ambassador to Cambodia. All the members
                    of that section spoke Vietnamese or Khmer. They would go into the countryside
                    for 18-19 days and then return to Saigon to write their report which would take
                    approximately a week and a half and then they would head back into the field.
                    They gathered information about conditions and programs from whomever would talk
                    to them - Vietnamese, Americans, civilians, military. Their reports provided us
                    and Washington with a composite picture of the situation in particular
                    provinces. It was not long before some of the other agencies staffs - CIA,
                    military, army civilians, AID - began to mumble resentment about these reports.
                    That was because the reports from our provincial reporting staff did not square
                    with the usually optimistic and up-beat tones of the reports that the
                    representatives of these other agencies were submitting to Saigon and
                    Washington. So this Pentagon-CINCPAC team wanted to change our reporting system
                    - they considered the reports to be “faulty.” The team complained that our
                    reports were “subjective”; they insisted that only “objective” measures be used
                    to measure what progress we were making in the countryside. So I asked what the
                    team suggested as “objective” criteria that might be used. The answer was a
                    classic; I was told by the team that the war was progressing much more favorably
                    for our side than our Embassy officers were reporting. They had looked at
                    certain statistics such as the number of local officials killed or wounded; that
                    number had dropped from the previous year and therefore they concluded, and
                    thought that I would conclude, that the war was obviously going our way. I think
                    the team was somewhat startled when we told them that the reason for that
                    “improvement” was because the local officials had all moved back into safe
                    military bases; there were in fact very few local officials left in the
                    countryside. Their “cause and effect” analysis was completely mistaken; we just
                    had to laugh. Unfortunately, these kinds of analyses led to the end of the
                    Embassy provincial reporting and to the quantified “hamlet evaluation” program
                    which was intended to prove how well pacification was working. It showed 96%
                    success just prior to Tet. False premises lead to false conclusions!</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In general I found the younger generation - the student leaders for example -
                    much more progressive than the power structure. I was greatly impressed by the
                    young people. They lived in those districts among the refugees. Initially, they
                    viewed us as the “enemy”; when they saw that we were also interested in their
                    agenda and were willing to give them support, their whole attitude towards us
                    changed. Sweet worked with them constantly; there were some NGOs
                    [non-governmental organizations] out there as well, but we tried to stay in the
                    background as much as we could. We had no U.S. military involved nor any senior
                    people from the U.S. civilian agencies. The emphasis was Vietnamese management
                    and it worked. Perhaps even more importantly, the people who lived in those
                    districts became strong supporters and vocal fans of the students, in part
                    because the students withstood considerable pressure and intimidation from City
                    Hall and other power centers. I suspect that we might find similar circumstances
                    if in a large U.S. city run by a political machine all of a sudden finds wards
                    declaring their independence and distancing themselves from City Hall.</p>
                <p>There was no question that corruption ran rampant in the government. I remember
                    one time Bob Komer coming out to Saigon; he gave us a briefing of Washington's
                    views of the situation. During his presentation, he insisted that we should get
                    rid of the corruption. I and some others asked him whether he wanted to get rid
                    of the whole Vietnamese government? That upset him. But we kept insisting that
                    Washington face reality; it had to understand and accept that most of the
                    Vietnamese leadership was extremely corrupt. They were pocketing a lot of money.
                    We named the Minister of Defense and others as illustrations. Washington knew
                    that the Vietnam leadership and much of the bureaucracy was corrupt. But what to
                    do about it was another question. Our only solution - inadequate at best - was
                    to run our own programs as honestly as we could and to target areas that were
                    likely to be less corrupt or quite clean like the three districts in Saigon I
                    mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>Corruption is very hard to ferret out. If we are occupying a country, such as
                    Japan, then it is possible to have control of the process. But where we are
                    “advisors” at best, as we were in Vietnam, the best we could do is observe,
                    preach and try to protect our own programs from the insidiousness of corruption.
                    In Vietnam, we were trying to prop up a leadership and a process that was not
                    able to gather sufficient popular support on its own; and therefore failed.</p>
                <p>Occasionally I had an opportunity to discuss the Vietnam situation with American
                    journalists. I had to use my own best judgement in those discussion; I was not
                    under any censorship, but I certainly was not giving a prediction of gloom and
                    doom. There was no “party” line, but I tried to stay as positive as I could. I
                    think Habib certainly agreed with my assessment of the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>During my tour in Saigon, the Buddhists were a very important element in the
                    political process. They were very much opposed to American involvement. At one
                    point there was a civil war in Hue and Da Nang; some Vietnamese army units
                    actually revolted against the central government; they were led by some
                    Buddhists. So we had to keep a wary eyes on the Buddhist monks. I find it
                    interesting today to recollect this religious involvement because it comes as a
                    great shock to the American public when it is mentioned that a major religion
                    and its leaders - Islam - are involved in a political process. That is nothing
                    new to those of us who watched the Buddhist monks leading political actions in
                    Vietnam. Of course, we also used the Catholic Church in Poland to put pressure
                    on the Soviets to leave that country. The use of religion for political purposes
                    has a centuries long history - e.g. the Crusades - , but somehow or other many
                    Americans found the Buddhist involvement novel and unacceptable. Much of this is
                    discussed in Don Oberdorfer's excellent book on the Tet offensive and its
                    effects. He and I - we are good friends - have discussed that issue on more than
                    one occasion.</p>
                <p>I must say that my Saigon tour was an extremely busy one. It was fun; I enjoyed
                    it, despite the family separation. I spent a lot of time in the office and going
                    around Saigon to talk to people. For a change of pace, John Negroponte and I
                    spent a lot of time playing badminton; it was a healthier form of release than
                    bar hopping or finding female companionship. Sometimes, we would find two other
                    officers and play tennis. Most Embassy officers, including Ambassador Lodge,
                    belonged to Cercle Sportive de Saigon - a Vietnamese club that we could join.
                    That is where we played because the Embassy had no facilities of its own. Of
                    course the Vietnamese used the club and some of them used to petition Ambassador
                    Lodge with one favor or another or provide some advice to him.</p>
                <p>There were a number of lessons that I learned from my Vietnam experience. In the
                    first place, I found out first hand how complicated situations could be.
                    Secondly, I learned that the U.S. had to be very careful about its involvement
                    in matters outside this country; it is far easier to become involved than to
                    disengage. As I mentioned earlier, we had no exit strategy in Vietnam and
                    therefore suffered frequently from the law of unintended consequences. That
                    lesson was an important one when later I was confronted with the Somalia
                    situation; I knew by then that all the facets of U.S. involvement had to be
                    drawn together - political, economic, humanitarian and military. When I got to
                    Mogadishu, in fact, I put three very good political officers together with some
                    AID folks - from the disaster relief program - and started a mini-CORDS program.
                    I would send them around to certain locations in Somalia to work with the
                    military teams and NGOs that were already stationed there in an effort to pull
                    all activities together towards some common objectives. I think that was a very
                    useful management technique.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I also learned in Vietnam - and later in other situations - to not mislead one's
                    friends. It was better to be above board - even if it was bad news - than to
                    take a position which later would obviously be seen as not honest. I think we
                    did that in some respects in Vietnam. We led some people down “a garden path” -
                    not necessarily deliberately or with malice of forethought - but some of our
                    analyses were obviously too optimistic. I had some qualms about that approach,
                    and I tried never to repeat what I consider to be a major mistake.</p>
                <p>I learned another lesson too, as illustrated by the following anecdote. I used to
                    talk to a Vietnamese journalist because he often had information that he could
                    not print.. On one occasion, he finally turned to me and said: “You know, you
                    Americans look on us as if we were just a basket of crabs. You don't really care
                    what the crabs are doing in that basket as long as they don't escape or as long
                    as someone is not stealing the basket away from you.” I thought then that he had
                    that right. It was exactly the way we viewed South Vietnam. These were “our”
                    crabs; they could do whatever they wanted in that basket as long as we held on
                    to the basket. It was obvious to the journalist and to others, I suspect, that
                    our motives were often quite selfish even when disguised in very noble
                    terms.</p>
                <p>There is no question in my mind that my tour in Vietnam stood me in good stead
                    for some of my later assignments. I look back on it frequently. For example,
                    during my first week in Somalia, I sat down with the Marine generals and
                    discussed the lessons of that “police action” and our unhappy experience in
                    Lebanon to make sure that we tried as best we could do avoid the mistakes made
                    during those U.S. actions.</p>
                <p>Vietnam was interesting. The only problem was that between the time I decided to
                    go to Vietnam and the time that I actually went, the Department had changed its
                    policy and was barring dependents from going with their sponsors. So that made
                    it tough on my wife Phyllis. We were separated for twenty months during which I
                    came back to the States once - on Lodge's plane. Lodge had been unable to
                    convince the Department to authorize Embassy officers to travel back to the U.S.
                    to see their families. It was alright to see the families somewhere overseas,
                    but not in the U.S.. Other agencies however authorized their officers to fly
                    back to the States for family visits. That was a major discrepancy in the
                    personnel policies of different agencies of the U.S. government and not helpful
                    to the morale of State employees. Finally, on one occasion, Lodge had to return
                    to Washington to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; he was
                    going to tell them how well things were going in Vietnam. While in Washington,
                    he went into Bill Crockett's office - who was then the Deputy Under Secretary
                    for Administration. Lodge told him that he would not leave that office until the
                    travel regulations were changed. It is wonderful how quickly an immutable
                    regulation can be revised! But for me, by that time it was too late. So except
                    for that one time, I did not see Phyllis for twenty months.</p>
                <p>Q: Your next assignment was to Paris. Was that an assignment that you sought?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Paris was not a post that I had requested. I guess it came as a reward
                    for my tour in Saigon.</p>
                <p>My job in Paris was in the Political section of the Embassy, reporting on African
                    and Middle East affairs. I had some experience in Africa and some interest in
                    the Middle East; in fact this became my first working relationship with Middle
                    East issues - a subject that I would follow for much of my career. Chip Bohlen
                    was my first Ambassador; he was followed by Sarge Shriver. The first was the
                    most senior career officer; the second an extraordinary political personage. The
                    same thing happen to me again after Paris when I served with the U.S. Mission to
                    the UN where my first ambassador was Charlie Yost who was followed by George
                    Bush. The chance to work for such special people was personally a very enriching
                    experience. My first DCM in Paris was Chris Chapman who was followed by Bob
                    Blake. The Political Counselors were Dick Funkhouser and Bob Anderson.</p>
                <p>Let me make a few comments about the stylistic differences between Bohlen and
                    Shriver. The first was an obvious super-diplomat; he was unparalleled in his
                    ability to work with de Gaulle - to the degree that any U.S. official could work
                    with the General. But he handled his ambassadorial duties in the formal way that
                    he had learned in his career. On the other hand, Shriver was just superb in his
                    P.R. efforts. I just recently talked to Shriver; he told me that Bohlen had
                    predicted that there was little he could accomplish in Paris. I told him that
                    had he come a year earlier, that probably would have been true. He arrived just
                    at the time that France was beginning to open up, thanks to the quasi-revolution
                    of 1968, after which France's relations with the rest of the world changed
                    dramatically for a time. The French began to look outwards and finally forced de
                    Gaulle out of office. He knew that it was time for him to leave the reins to
                    others. Shriver had a unique style; he went to the Left Bank to observe the
                    anti-de Gaulle student riots - before he had even presented his credentials. It
                    was that uprising that forced a change in French attitudes and in fact was the
                    beginning of de Gaulle's demise and, as I told Shriver, it opened the door for
                    an American ambassador to play a more important role in France. He agreed with
                    that assessment.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In fact, Shriver acted as if he were the U.S. ambassador to a third world
                    country. He went down into the pits with the coal miners; he visited the
                    vineyards to talk to the growers; he would talk to the shop-keepers. He had many
                    of the ordinary French people to Thanksgiving dinner. The Embassy was a real
                    live place during Shriver's tour. Shriver set up a “youth committee” to sort of
                    parallel the Embassy's structure. Ted McNamara, Frances Cook and I were part of
                    this “youth” movement. On one occasion, during the transformation of French
                    attitudes and in the middle of the student-inspired strikes and agitation, he
                    had the President of Yale - Kingman Brewster - who was visiting, as the guest of
                    honor at one of his typical soirees. The custom was that the guests would mingle
                    briefly before dinner, eat the repast and then have a long, long discussion
                    about issues of interest to his guests. For this particular dinner, he had also
                    invited the Minister of Education, the President of the Sorbonne University as
                    well as some of the radical professors and representatives of the student
                    movement. It was a very lively evening, I can assure you! These kinds of events
                    occurred frequently; on occasion, he would have as many as four events at the
                    Residence in one day - a breakfast, a lunch, a tea, and a dinner - all very
                    lively. On another occasion, he got Wilbur Cohen, the Secretary of HEW, to come
                    to Paris for one of these dinner sessions. Shriver would monitor the movements
                    of all leading Americans; if they were in Europe, he would insist that they come
                    to Paris where he would put them to work, allowing the French to express their
                    views to our leaders and vice-versa.</p>
                <p>For one Thanksgiving dinner, he invited movie stars, sports stars, coal miners,
                    farmers, shop keepers - a real mixture of French society as well as the
                    bourgeoisie such as the Rothschilds. Shriver had an extraordinary effervescence
                    that somehow enabled him to bring together disparate elements of French society
                    for lively, but civil, discourse. Of course, his style created an extra workload
                    for us in the Embassy staff, but it was fun and we did not resent it. It was
                    also an extra workload for Phyllis and some of the other wives; she was not a
                    member of the Foreign Service at that time; nevertheless she became part of the
                    Shriver entourage and she enjoyed the experience.</p>
                <p>On the other hand; Sarge had some weaknesses. He was not a skilled diplomat; he
                    insisted on speaking French which was atrocious. After the first time he had a
                    meeting alone with the Foreign Minister, we got an anguished call from the Quai
                    - the Foreign Ministry. John Dean - he was handling Far Eastern affairs in the
                    Embassy - and I rushed over. We were told that it appeared that we had changed
                    our entire foreign policy on Vietnam, Biafra and the Middle East. So we sat down
                    with our French counterparts and reviewed the conversation that Shriver had with
                    the Foreign Minister. The review obviously called for major revisions in the
                    “memorandum of conversation” which the French note-taker had drafted. That
                    established a pattern; after each of his conversations with the Foreign
                    Minister, we would sit down with our French counterparts and clear up any
                    misunderstandings that Shriver may have left behind because of his unfamiliarity
                    with the French language. As far as I know, he never knew what we had done!</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Shriver was much more accessible than Bohlen was. His door was always wide open -
                    to anyone. He just had a different style and was helped immensely by the change
                    in French attitudes. I remember the Foreign Service inspectors coming to Paris
                    when Bob Blake was the DCM and saying: “Isn't it bad enough to have an 'unusual'
                    ambassador; is it necessary to have an 'unusual' DCM as well?” Blake had a
                    personality similar to Shriver's; he was an extrovert, glad-handing his way
                    through crowds; not terribly well organized but very smart. They were a real
                    combination!</p>
                <p>Bob Anderson, who was my boss for a while, had a lot of French friends. He let
                    his officers do pretty much what they wanted; I could set my own priorities and
                    reporting targets. That was a problem for me because I had to set my own
                    priorities. With all the issues that were pending in the Middle East and Africa,
                    I had to be quite selective; I could not possibly give full coverage to all. I
                    was in contact with the Quai all the time, with other embassies, with the staff
                    of the Ministry of Cooperation. One of our very good friends was the Chef de
                    Cabinet to Foccart; he was a very important source because it was Foccart who in
                    effect ran France's African policy. He was a young man who attended my first
                    meeting with Foccart and thereafter our families became very close. This fellow
                    was very open with me. One day, he called me and told me that Foccart was
                    sending the Minister of Cooperation to Brazzaville. That puzzled me, but then I
                    was told that the French government did not like the way things were going in
                    the Congo. They were concerned that the government was too close to the
                    communists. About six weeks after the Minister's visit, there was a coup in the
                    Congo which brought in a new government. A few days later, my friend called to
                    let me know that Foccart was sending the Minister for Cooperation to Bamako,
                    Mali. I asked: “Just like he did to Brazzaville?” I was told that the French
                    regarded the Mali situation as even worse than the Congo had been. In this case,
                    it took only three weeks after the visit for the Mali government to be
                    overthrown.</p>
                <p>Sometime later, I asked my French friend about Bokassa, the horrible Prime
                    Minister of the Central African Republic. I noted that I thought that Bokassa
                    was a real threat and a terrible leader. I was then told that if we could find
                    someone better in the CAR, the French would be glad to review the situation;
                    they had not been able to find a better leader. I think these events and
                    conversations were quite revealing about French African policies. They could and
                    did manipulate the leadership in their former colonies.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I had a similar experience with the chief of the Middle East division in the
                    Quai. Right after his inauguration in 1969, Nixon made his first Presidential
                    trip to Europe. He came to Paris. The Quai official had not been very
                    communicative, but when the visit was announced he came to me, under
                    instructions, and said: “We are now going to try to work with the U.S. in the
                    Middle East because we also are very concerned about Soviet penetration of the
                    area”. So he gave me a complete run down on the briefing paper that the Quai had
                    sent to de Gaulle for his discussions with Nixon. I was made privy to all of the
                    details of French views and policies. I was able to get that information to
                    Kissinger and Nixon's staff before their arrival in Paris. They were very
                    interested and that French initiative led to four-power talks - U.S., France,
                    Great Britain and the USSR - that were subsequently convened on the Middle East.
                    It was a fascinating process because the French shifted their policy 180
                    degrees; instead of working against us, as they had been, they decided to try
                    and work with us. They had come to the conclusion that the situation in the
                    Middle East had so deteriorated by 1969 that cooperation was by far the better
                    policy. They hoped that Nixon would be a willing partner and in fact, for a
                    while, we did work together on Middle East issues. The four power talks did get
                    started in Paris; I think Dick Funkhouser was our principal representative, but
                    I went with him to all the meetings. His counterparts in the other three
                    embassies were their countries' spokesmen. We were trying to foster and support
                    the UN sponsored efforts led by Ambassador Jarring which were supposed to lead
                    to a peaceful resolution of the complicated Middle East issues. There were
                    parallel talks being held in New York, but that was no problem; the coordination
                    was very good and we never got our signals mixed up. Our Paris group worked on
                    some details. Paris was agreed upon as the location for the talks because the
                    French had been the originators of the idea of four power talks. It was a de
                    Gaulle initiative. Eventually, the talks collapsed because we and the French
                    just had great difficulties working together on anything, particularly something
                    as sensitive as the Middle East. Kissinger's approach, as the NSC Advisor, was
                    to work quite independently of the bureaucracy. Eventually, the talks collapsed;
                    I won't say they were deliberatively sabotaged by us, but the NSC did not give
                    it much support. Furthermore, the Israelis did not like the formula very much;
                    they were left out of the talks.</p>
                <p>At the beginning, I thought that those talks might actually produce some positive
                    actions and coordinated policies. I did not find that the French and the USSR
                    sided against us and the British, as was expected by some; I would say that in a
                    majority of the questions, the French sided with their western allies. That gave
                    me some hopes that the four power talks could have some successes. But like the
                    Rogers' plan and other State Department initiatives, the four power talks in the
                    final analysis went nowhere. Of course, in early 1969, none of us knew much if
                    anything about Kissinger and his modus operandi. But we learned! One day, my
                    friend at the Quai asked me to come over and he let me see a reporting telegram
                    from the French Ambassador in Washington concerning a conversation he had had
                    with Kissinger. After reading it, I wrote an “Official-Informal” letter to Joe
                    Sisco then the Assistant Secretary for NEA, reporting what I had read. He was
                    very grateful for that information because he said that this was the first time
                    he had really found out what the details of Kissinger's Middle East policy
                    were.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I mentioned Nixon's visit. I was involved to some degree with the arrangements.
                    The President made a point of meeting with non-governmental officials - union
                    leaders, youth leaders, political opposition. He tossed all these disparate
                    elements together which was a good approach. In Paris, he just listened for
                    about two hours, trying to get a sense of what the French “public” thought was
                    going on. I found it a fascinating session and an interesting approach to
                    getting a “feel for the country.” I arranged that meeting. But I also remember
                    from that trip how difficult Ehrlichman and Haldeman were. They advanced the
                    President's visit. They demanded an extraordinary amount of detailed planning,
                    making the visit seem more like a movie script than a spontaneous visit. We
                    would have to chart the room that the President was going to enter and then
                    describe - step by step - exactly how he would proceed to his seat. We would go
                    over every inch of the event time and time again; it was an agonizing experience
                    for the Embassy. Everyone charged with responsibility for a particular event had
                    to draw these elaborate and very detailed plans.</p>
                <p>I think in general my personal relationships with the French was quite good. As I
                    said, after a while, several of the officials became quite open with me and we
                    became good friends with a number of them. It made for very good collaboration.
                    It takes the French a little while to extend trust to a foreigner, but once
                    having done so, I found them quite easy to work with. I think we worked well
                    together on Middle East and African matters. The existence of jobs in the
                    Embassy concerned with regional affairs was very useful, particularly in the
                    areas that I covered where France played a leading role. In many African
                    countries they had the predominant role; in others they had important roles. It
                    was in our interest to have officers stationed in Paris concerned with African,
                    Middle East and Far Eastern affairs; the U.S. learned a lot about what was going
                    on in those areas from the French - not only about what was going on, but also
                    about what the French were going to do. Furthermore, African chiefs of state
                    were coming to and going from Paris constantly; after I had become acquainted
                    with their embassies, I also had an opportunity to meet with chiefs of state.
                    That gave us one more point of contact with important African persons - of
                    course, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, we did care about Africa!</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>During my tour in Paris, the French were playing also a significant role in the
                    Middle East and that made our liaison job in the Embassy a significant link in
                    the process. Now the French have largely withdrawn from the Middle East, more or
                    less, but at the time we are discussing, they were a significant player. I think
                    our regional jobs were important not only because of France's roles in the
                    areas, but also because it gave us an additional avenue for access to regional
                    leaders who would visit Paris - that was true for African leaders, as I have
                    mentioned, and Middle East leaders as well. It gave us another source of
                    information of their perspectives on what was going on in their countries and
                    regions. Since I also maintained contacts with the representatives of the
                    African and Middle East countries in Paris, that was an additional source of
                    information for us. Their ambassadors were considered among their top officials
                    because France was an important country and the African and Middle East states
                    used to send the best talent to represent them in France. These were very useful
                    avenues for information collection and the expression of U.S. views on various
                    issues. Since the U.S. had multiple channels to these leaders, there was always
                    the theoretical risk of “mixed messages”, but I never encountered such a
                    situation. My main problem was essentially time; I didn't know what priority
                    Washington gave to all of my contacts and work-load; I had to set my own
                    priorities. I had more to do than I had time.</p>
                <p>I earlier mentioned the student uprisings. I also mentioned that I had the
                    “youth” portfolio in the Embassy; i.e. I was supposed to cover the comings and
                    goings of the French younger generation. The student rebellion started in a
                    courtyard of the Sorbonne University when two groups of students began to fight
                    each other. The riot police then entered the University grounds trying to bring
                    calm. Thereupon, all of the students turned on the police. That began to spill
                    out of the University grounds unto the surrounding streets. More police came;
                    more students came. That melee was joined by union rank and file members who
                    joined the students. That brought police reinforcements from outside of Paris.
                    The confrontation continued to escalate over a period of days. Atone stage, de
                    Gaulle left the country to meet with his generals in Germany; he was totally
                    confused and didn't know what actions to take. When he returned, he found a
                    situation totally out of control. I and others in the Embassy used to go to the
                    Left Bank to observe the action with our own eyes. Much of my information on
                    events came from my friend in Foccart's office; he kept me abreast of
                    developments. Foccart soon brought his friends together - most of them having
                    been veterans of de Gaulle's resistance forces. They organized counter moves,
                    led by Foccart and the Minister of the Interior. After about three weeks of
                    total chaos, they marshaled their forces for a big march down the
                    Champs-Elys�es. This turned the tide.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>It was interesting to us in the Embassy to watch this rebellion spread - from the
                    Sorbonne to Paris to other French cities and then nation-wide strikes. Union
                    leaders were opposed to the participation of their members in the general
                    strike. It was not like the general strike of a couple of months' ago which was
                    led by union leaders; in 1968, it was the membership that led the general
                    strike. They held huge parades, led by standard bearers waiving huge red and
                    black flags. Interestingly enough, the Communist Party leadership also did not
                    support the strikes, but it was forced into support by its rank and file
                    members. The union membership was in essence showing its dismay with ten years
                    of authoritarian de Gaulle rule. They decided to act like “Frenchmen” and stand
                    up for their own rights. So they did!The change of direction in the Communist
                    Party leadership was crucial to the outcome of the uprising. When that
                    leadership decided to throw its lot with the rebels, it scared the hell out of
                    the middle and upper French classes. The Communist made the uprising appear as
                    its own; that allowed the government to capitalize on the fears of the majority
                    of the French people.</p>
                <p>From my point of view - i.e. as the “Youth” officer of the Embassy - , I found it
                    most interesting to watch every major French professional sector - lawyers,
                    doctors, professors, architects, etc - going through a similar process: the
                    young professionals were in revolt against the leadership provided by the older
                    generation. They viewed that leadership as authoritarian and rigid; they viewed
                    the “professional” system as antediluvian - since its origins really stemmed
                    back to the time of the French monarchy. So the revolution was not only in the
                    streets, but throughout French society. All of the foundations of society were
                    shaken; the younger generation was not willing to abide by the authoritarian
                    regime that had been imposed on it by their elders - with de Gaulle being only a
                    symbol of what in fact was a prevailing authoritarian process in all French
                    institutions. The students, with whom we talked, expressed their hope that the
                    American educational system could be exported to France. As always, these
                    uprising had internal contradictions; on the one hand, we and the Soviets were
                    being vilified because in the streets we were perceived as France's principal
                    foreign “enemies”; on the other hand, the students wished for an educational
                    system modeled after ours. Shriver played that for all it was worth; he was
                    always ready to talk to the students about U.S. society and culture. He drew on
                    his experiences in the Peace Corps; he reached out to the French youth and was a
                    real asset for the U.S. image. The riots made no difference to Shriver's
                    approach of trying to get American leadership together with French citizens; he
                    just reveled in his efforts to bring the two communities together, whether
                    through social events or just exchanges on the streets.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Another interesting aspect of the rebellion was the reaction of some of the
                    senior French leaders, like Cabinet members. Although it was their generation
                    and their institutions that were under attack, some of them were quite proud of
                    their children who were rioting in the streets, building barricades and throwing
                    bricks at the cops. They took great pride in their children who were behaving in
                    the “typical” French manner - as history tells us. They thought it was
                    wonderful! My friend in Foccart's office told me that the Prime Minister was
                    making a big mistake when he decided to crack down on the students, including
                    not permitting some of the leaders back into the country. My friend's advice to
                    Foccart was to keep repressive measures to a minimum, in part because he felt
                    that the Prime Minister's tactics were leading to further deterioration of the
                    situation, not an improvement. But his advice was ignored.</p>
                <p>The Embassy did not take any special security precautions because the students
                    and the workers were not targeting the Embassy. Of course, life was hardly
                    normal; there was no gasoline, trains were not running, mail was not being
                    delivered, no schools were open; very little of customary life remained the
                    same. Phyllis finally said: “I think the strike will be broken soon because the
                    women are becoming increasingly unhappy. They are shut in their apartments with
                    the children. The men are having a great time occupying the factories; the women
                    are going to start very soon taking the kids to the factories and dumping them
                    on their husbands. That will bring the strike to a halt!” In fact, I think these
                    domestic tensions did help end the strike. At the beginning of the revolution
                    and for the following two weeks, people were very excited; they could join their
                    friends in the streets and vent their frustrations without consequences. I have
                    never seen a population so elated and on a “high”. There was real comraderie;
                    people were picking up hitchhikers, people were talking to each other - a real
                    feeling of community, such as one might see in Washington in a snowstorm in one
                    of our neighborhoods. It was very un-French - they usually do not speak to
                    strangers or join in communal activities. But after that initial feeling of
                    freedom, the consequences of service stoppages began to fray people's nerves.
                    They began to wonder where and when it would all end. In light of recent events
                    here in Washington, one can say that the French close their governments from
                    below, we from above.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Let me expand a little on my role as the Embassy's “Youth” officer. Sarge asked
                    in essence that a “Youth Committee” be established which would reach out to the
                    younger Frenchmen - young Parliamentary deputies, student leaders, the young
                    French leaders in all walks of life. At one time, he organized a tour of the
                    U.S. for twelve of them, with transportation paid by some of his American
                    friends - not the government. Fritz Stern came to Paris to pick up the crew and
                    take them to and through the U.S.. The group consisted primarily of young
                    professors and younger government officials who espoused anti-U.S. views,
                    although they knew very little about us. We picked them very carefully. These
                    were people who during the revolt had played key roles. Once this group got to
                    the U.S., USIA picked them up and developed a program for them. The general
                    concept was to expose these younger leaders to the U.S. so that they could talk
                    somewhat more authoritatively about the U.S.. After they returned,, they were
                    included in the soirees at the Residence as were many other younger French
                    leaders. We would also include them in events in our apartments. Frances Cook
                    and Ted McNamara, who were members of our “Youth Committee” were very active. I
                    think I chaired the group, but it was an effort that depended on the work of all
                    of us. Some of our more senior colleagues called it the “counter-embassy”
                    because we used to cut across the standard lines of authority - sometime
                    bypassing the Political and Economic Counselors. We used to quote the Ambassador
                    as our authority which I am sure didn't make the seniors feel any better.</p>
                <p>We met with the students continually in informal “bull” sessions. We were all
                    about the same age. I don't believe I ever gave a formal speech, but we were in
                    contact with those students all the time. It was great fun - for all of us, I
                    believe. It was good for our morale; it added excitement to our work, even
                    though it was in addition to our regular duties, which as I mentioned earlier,
                    in my case certainly, was already more than I could handle. Unfortunately, I had
                    left by the time the twelve younger leaders returned from their tour of the
                    U.S., but I am sure that my Embassy colleagues stayed in touch with them.</p>
                <p>I use this example of the younger leaders' travel to the U.S. as an illustration
                    of Shriver's modus operandi. I thought it was marvelous. Had he been in France
                    before the 1968 uprising, his approach would not have worked. At one time, we
                    managed to get a hold of a report written by one of the provincial prefects to
                    the Minister of Interior asking for guidance on how to handle the American
                    Ambassador on his visits. He said that, if it were not the American Ambassador,
                    he would have arrested him for subversive activities! The French were mystified
                    by this very unconventional American envoy; neither they or the Embassy had ever
                    worked with or for such an ambassador. I think the Shriver approach - which was
                    replicated by others in other countries - was a real worthwhile effort. I wished
                    it could have continued. It was atypical, but very effective. It was not the
                    customary “stuffed shirt” approach that the Department, ambassadors and embassy
                    staffs usually take. It requires an unusual leader who will infuse “his troops”
                    with his or her enthusiasm for the unconventional. I thought Sarge's performance
                    in Paris was exceptional and well worthwhile. He had the right perception of
                    what moves a country.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I had some knowledge of the Vietnam talks that were being conducted in Paris
                    while I was there because many of my Saigon friends participated in them.
                    Holbrooke was there, Negroponte was there, Habib was there. We had all worked
                    together in Saigon. I did not know about Kissinger's involvement in these talks.
                    At my farewell party, Habib confessed that while Phyllis and I were on leave on
                    the Riviera and he was using our apartment, he conducted the first secret talks
                    with the North Vietnamese there. John Negroponte was both the interpreter and
                    the food caterer - he had to get it so that the negotiators could eat in our
                    apartment - so that the meetings might be less exposed to public observance.
                    That explained some of the residue that we found when we returned from the
                    Riviera which had been a mystery to us; we didn't know where all the left-overs
                    had come from. So at my farewell - which took place six months after those
                    negotiations had been held in our apartment - Phil explained what had happened.
                    Of course, we knew that Harriman was in town and we knew that some discussions
                    with the North Vietnamese were being held. The fact that negotiations had begun
                    was also helpful to the Embassy because it improved the atmosphere in Paris for
                    the conduct of U.S.-French bilateral issues. Just the fact that we were talking
                    to the Vietnamese removed a French psychological block in the way they looked at
                    the U.S.. I think they were pleased that we were talking to the Vietnamese and
                    doing so in Paris. I think the initiation of these talks helped change the
                    French attitude toward the U.S.; they viewed us thereafter in an entirely
                    different light.</p>
                <p>The change in French leadership - from de Gaulle to Pompidou - did not make that
                    much of a difference because both men had basically the same view; their styles
                    were different, but not their objectives or policies. Pompidou was elected
                    because the French revolted against de Gaulle's authoritarianism, but I don't
                    believe that basic French policy changed much because of the change of
                    presidents. I was there when the change took place, but I think the new French
                    attitude towards the U.S. preceded the change in presidents. Before the actual
                    occurrence, I think that most people understood that de Gaulle was finished; his
                    views were no longer dominant after the revolution of May 1968. I think that
                    even de Gaulle knew that his days were numbered. He expected the referendum to
                    be a vote on his style of government as did the people and they rejected it. It
                    was an elegant way for de Gaulle to leave; I think he felt that he would lose
                    the referendum, and when he did, it was a graceful and democratic way to leave
                    the presidency. I heard that his staff was already packing their stuff in their
                    offices even before the results of the referendum were announced. I suspect that
                    de Gaulle was willing to give the referendum a chance, but I doubt that he had
                    much confidence in winning support. He considered the French people ungrateful
                    for his past services to his country, but I suspect that he was quite fatalistic
                    at the end - “If they are not with me, what can I can do?”</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>As a summary of my tour in Paris, I think I should say that my first year was
                    terribly dull. I was just working on Africa, not the Middle East. There was very
                    little action. But then the Department for budgetary reasons had to cut back on
                    staff. The separate Middle East position was abolished and I inherited that
                    portfolio. Then the action began. Nixon was inaugurated in 1969 and that started
                    a cooperative effort between us and the French on the Middle East, as I
                    described earlier. Shriver didn't leave Paris until March, 1970. The riots
                    started in May 1968. All of these events made the last years of my tour very
                    lively. I had fun in Paris. So did the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in 1970, Ambassador Charlie Yost asked you to join
                        him iNew York as a member of the UN delegation. How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yost was looking for someone to handle the Middle East portfolio on his
                    delegation. I had some knowledge of the area from my tour in Paris, especially
                    my participation of the Four Powers talks in Paris. Through that participation,
                    I must have come to the attention of the UN delegation, which led to Yost's
                    offer, which I gladly accepted. I had not known Yost before.</p>
                <p>In New York, I worked for Bill Buffum more than anyone else. The UN work centered
                    around meetings; there were many of them, particularly with the Egyptian and
                    Israeli delegations. I could learn a lot about what was going on from these
                    meetings. Amr Mousa, a young Egyptian diplomat, about my age - perhaps even a
                    little younger - was a member of the Egyptian delegation; he is now the Foreign
                    Minister and very influential. I remember working with Rita Houser who was a
                    member of our delegation, serving on the Legal Committee of the General
                    Assembly. She was and still is a remarkable person. With a little help from me -
                    but mostly on her own - she wrote a speech about the Geneva Convention and its
                    relevance to the Occupied Territories. It was the first time the U.S. had made
                    that linkage - to the great distress of the Israelis and the leaders of the
                    Jewish community in New York. Rita stuck to her guns. She became a great friend
                    of Arafat and counseled him prior to the Oslo process and since. That was a
                    personal relationship that has survived for many years.</p>
                <p>But the meetings went on all the time in connection with official UN committee
                    meetings and for other reasons. In most instances, we and Washington were
                    working very much in parallel. I knew Roy Atherton quite well - from my Paris
                    days when he would come through town. I knew Hal Saunders from college days when
                    we were classmates and good friends. Joe Sisco, I had worked for in the Office
                    of UN Political Affairs - 1960-63. Joe in fact was really the link in my
                    assignments. So I knew the leading players on the Middle East in Washington
                    quite well. In fact, I participated in some of the Middle East talks that Joe
                    conducted with Soviet Ambassador Dobyrnin. Those Two Power talks were being
                    conducted simultaneously with the Four Power talks which were being conducted in
                    New York, having moved there from Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The Two Power talks probably started in 1970. Kissinger had not yet established
                    total control over U.S. foreign policy; he showed some reluctance to become
                    involved in the Middle East early in his stewardship. Eventually, as he noted in
                    his memoirs, he established his own channels to conduct the Middle East peace
                    process independent of State's activities. Later on, he was able to say that the
                    Department had screwed things up because the cease fire agreement had been
                    negotiated, which was violated by the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>The major objective of the Four Power talks held in New York was to agree on the
                    details for the framework established by UN Resolution 242. There were a lot of
                    details that the four countries had to agree to on withdrawal - from where, to
                    where, etc. Some of the Four Power agreements in NY were later encompassed in
                    the Rogers' Plan, after the Four Power talks had been abandoned for all
                    practical purposes.</p>
                <p>As I said, while these Four Power talks were on going, Sisco held his private
                    discussions with Dobyrnin and his deputy, Yuli Vorontsov, who is now the Russian
                    Ambassador to the U.S.. Out of that came the 1970 cease fire agreement. But, as
                    I said earlier, the Egyptians subsequently violated it - with the support of the
                    Soviets—by placing SAM missiles along the Suez Canal. The Israelis found out
                    about that deployment and that brought all the discussions about peace to a
                    screeching halt. As I also mentioned earlier, this Egyptian move was used by
                    Kissinger against the State Department; he accused the Department of “allowing”
                    the Egyptians to break the cease fire agreement.</p>
                <p>I thought at the time that the Four Power talks could have been useful. But they
                    became less and less important as agreement became harder and harder to achieve.
                    We were limited on our side by the Israelis and the Soviets did not show enough
                    flexibility. There weren't enough incentives for all sides to make the necessary
                    compromises. The U.S. government wasn't willing to make the extra effort which
                    would have required the imposition of some limitations on Israel. This was an
                    outcome that might have been foreseen before the start of the talks, but it was
                    not clear to me at least that the talks could not be conclusive. The Two Power
                    talks were a little more specific. They were not about frameworks, but more
                    concrete issues; in general, they were intended to enable the two super-powers
                    to reach a better understanding of each other's positions. Those talks did lead
                    to some agreement, but, as the Soviet Mission to the UN's Political Counselor
                    told me when I showed him photographs of the SAM sites, there were times when
                    the Soviet diplomats also did not know what was going on in the military sphere.
                    The Soviet military had something going with the Egyptians and probably were not
                    about to have it scuttled. The Politburo probably decided to work on two tracks,
                    with neither necessarily knowing what was going on the other. I did have the
                    feeling that Dobyrnin was interested in achieving some concrete results from his
                    talks with Sisco, although the authority on that is really Joe Sisco.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I said earlier that the UN delegation and Washington worked well together. I did
                    have one personal disconnect and that was related to the 1971 Pakistani problem.
                    Over a period of time, it became clear to me that the U.S. was tilting towards
                    Pakistan and protecting it. Of course, I knew nothing at the time about
                    Kissinger's use of Pakistan for our opening to China. We did not, for example,
                    criticize Pakistan for its atrocious behavior in East Pakistan, where thousands
                    of people were killed and millions of refugees were forced to flee. In New York,
                    we worked out a plan with Brian Urquhart, the UN Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, to have the ICRC (International Commission for Refugees) working in
                    East Pakistan and the UNHCR (the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) working in
                    India with the East Pakistani refugees, along with many NGOs, to flood East
                    Pakistan with relief workers in the hopes of stemming the violence being
                    perpetrated on the population by the Pakistani military government. We hoped to
                    stabilize the political situation.</p>
                <p>Our hopes came to naught because Sadruddin Khan, the UN High Commissioner for
                    Refugees, wanted to have part of the action. He called a meeting in Geneva and
                    told the delegates that a humanitarian peace keeping operation would be mounted
                    - a phrase so much in vogue today. Both the Indians and the Pakistanis turned
                    down the suggestion in a hurry. They would not support a peace keeping effort;
                    they would have agreed on a humanitarian support program. But with some
                    encouragement from the U.S. delegation, Urquhart convinced the Secretary
                    General, U Thant, to send a letter to the five Permanent members of the Security
                    Council, which in effect said that the East Pakistan situation was very likely
                    to become a serious threat to international peace and security and he invited
                    the five Powers to join him in taking some action to stem the deteriorating
                    situation. We got word from Washington - from Kissinger - that under no
                    circumstances would the U.S. join U Thant in his proposal. We were told that the
                    U.S. would not put any pressure on our Pakistani friends and that we would
                    therefore not participate in any action. Later that year, in December, Kissinger
                    criticized the UN for “doing nothing” about the East Pakistan situation. I had
                    no idea why Washington had put the damper on our efforts to do something about
                    Pakistani atrocities; I was mystified and none of my colleagues in the
                    Department could clarify Washington's policy on this issue before we learned of
                    the U.S.-Pakistan-China connection.</p>
                <p>I thought that the UN was a moderately useful institution. It was not terribly
                    effective, but it was moderately useful for political purposes - not
                    operational. It provided a good forum for multilateral and some bilateral
                    discussions among and between countries. At the time, peace keeping was not a
                    major activity; in fact, besides the development assistance programs, the UN did
                    not conduct many activities at that time. But there were many political
                    discussions among representatives of various countries. Of course, these talks,
                    such as the Four Power ones, could have been held in another venue, but the UN
                    was a convenient site.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>On the Middle East per se, the US, as I said, was trying to move on the
                    implementation of U.S. Resolution 242. The UN, through the good offices of
                    Ambassador Jarring, had not had much success, forcing the U.S. to become more
                    and more active. As UN began to fade out of the picture, a vacuum was created
                    into which we stepped. Despite Kissinger's misgivings, we pushed the Rogers'
                    Plan which was met by a cold Israeli reaction. From that we went to the failed
                    cease fire in 1970; then to a period of detente, during which we and the Soviets
                    agreed just to put a lid on the Middle East. Eventually that lid blew off
                    because Sadat could not take it anymore; he found a situation of “no peace, no
                    war” intolerable; we didn't take his warnings seriously enough because he did go
                    to war.</p>
                <p>I think I had some impact on our UN activities. Even though I was only a middle
                    grade officer, I think people listened to my ideas, both on Middle East issues
                    and others - both in New York and in Washington. Urquhart and I were very good
                    friends and we worked together very closely. The Washington backstopping was
                    quite good; there was no perceivable friction between the Bureau for
                    International Organizations (IO) and the Bureau for Near East Affairs (NEA). I
                    do remember, with some amusement, that when Joe Sisco was the IO Assistant
                    Secretary, he would always latch on to Middle East issues under the guise that
                    these issues were being discussed in UN context. But when he became the
                    Assistant Secretary for NEA, all of a sudden the UN had nothing to do with the
                    Middle East; the issues were all regional and therefore under the purview of the
                    regional bureau - a classic example of “where you sit, determines where you
                    stand.” I think Joe understood that even better when one day he went to the
                    Department in a snowstorm on a snowplow and his picture appeared on the front
                    page of the “Washington Post” the next morning. Being responsible for the Middle
                    East made him a front page item, but only Joe could pull off going to work on a
                    snowplow!</p>
                <p>I thought my tour at the UN very worthwhile. I got to know George Bush there; he
                    had an “open door” policy - although I had excellent access to Yost as well -
                    and somewhat like Shriver, liked new ideas and approaches. I think the nature of
                    the our delegation changed when Bush took charge. In fact, I think there were
                    some similarities in the change from Bohlen to Shriver in Paris and from Yost to
                    Bush in New York. The U.S. delegation at the UN became a much livelier place; I
                    think it took on greater importance in the development and implementation of
                    U.S. foreign policy. Although quite different personalities, both Shriver and
                    Bush were “political animals” with considerable clout in Washington. Both were
                    more open and more lively than their professional predecessors. The Delegation
                    worked well under Yost. It was well organized, but Bush brought to it a new
                    life.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Bush spent some time on Middle East issues, but it was not during this period the
                    priority that it became later. I have always been an activist and undoubtedly I
                    would have liked to see a greater U.S. engagement in the region. I am not sure
                    that I fully understood at the time the dynamics of the political situation in
                    the area; I don't think I predicted catastrophe unless the U.S. became more
                    involved. Everyone was still under influence of the 1967 events when the Arabs
                    were beaten so badly; I don't think in the late 1960s or early 1970s anyone was
                    predicting a resumption of hostilities. As a matter of fact, the record I think
                    will show that the Israelis themselves in 1973 refused to believe that Sadat
                    would mount an attack, they believed that the Egyptians were conducting
                    “military exercises.” We did notice the Soviets and the Egyptians making some
                    minor moves along the Canal, but that was not considered a threat and therefore
                    not very effective. I don't think anyone in this period was concerned about
                    renewal of hostilities. We were more concerned about Soviet penetration of the
                    Arab world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your tour at the UN, you were assigned in 1971 to
                        Beirut athe Political Counselor. How did that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was a lucky assignment. Beirut at the time was calm and as I think
                    most observers will vouch, it was a very lovely city with great places to eat,
                    swim, and enjoy life. I don't think the Oakleys ever found a better place. Bill
                    Buffum, for whom I worked in NY, became our Ambassador to Lebanon and he asked
                    that I join his staff. I remember the advice I received from my first
                    ambassador, Jimmy Moose; he said: “What will become of you in your Foreign
                    Service career will be determined by the time it is all over in equal
                    proportions by three factors: what you know, who you know, and luck!” In the
                    case of Beirut, it was that someone whom I knew had some appreciation for my
                    abilities - or potential - and asked me to become the Embassy's Political
                    Counselor.</p>
                <p>I knew very little about the Lebanon situation before the assignment was made. I
                    didn't have much briefing either; as usual it was “hurry up and get there” - as
                    all my assignments have been. I have always envied those who had time for
                    language and area training. As I said, Buffum was the Ambassador; Bob Houghton
                    was the DCM. Bob was the “Arabist;” neither Buffum or I were.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>In the early 1970s, we were not interested so much in Lebanon. We still viewed
                    Lebanon as a side show in the Middle East. There was some U.S. interest in
                    Lebanese commercial opportunities because at this time, Lebanon was the
                    cross-roads for Middle East commercial traffic. After the 1973 war, with the
                    major spike in oil prices, we began to deal directly with the Persian Gulf
                    states and other countries that until then had been reluctant to deal directly
                    with the U.S. because of the Arab-Israel conflict. So until then, Lebanon was
                    the center of our economic relations with Arab states. Egyptian, Saudi,
                    Jordanian, Kuwaiti entrepreneurs and commercial people like bankers used to come
                    to Beirut to transact business. By the time I left, the reduction in the
                    importance of Lebanon as a commercial center was really beginning, in part as I
                    said because of the opening of the Arab world to the U.S. which included the
                    infusion of sizeable investments. Then came the Lebanese civil war, which
                    certainly reduced and practically eliminated that country from commercial
                    activities. But in the early 1970s, our main interests in Lebanon were still
                    commerce.</p>
                <p>This U.S. focus probably led to some feeling in the Embassy that it was being
                    somewhat neglected by Washington. But both Buffum and I recognized that it was
                    hard for us - in a post considered not central to U.S. foreign policy - to have
                    our views taken very seriously by senior officials in Washington. I always had
                    an aversion to claiming that my post was the center of the universe; so did
                    Buffum. So we accepted our lot and didn't mount any campaign for “greater
                    recognition.”</p>
                <p>Beneath the surface calm, there were many rivalries in Lebanon. There was some
                    terrorism, primarily conducted by one group of Palestinians or another. They
                    used Lebanon as their home base; more specifically, the refugee camps were the
                    breeding grounds both for recruitment and for base of operations. Organizations
                    like the Japanese Red Army, the Italian Red Brigades, the Armenian terrorist
                    groups in addition to the Palestinian groups used the camps as “home base.”
                    There were tensions between the Palestinians and the Lebanese government, which
                    at the time was dominated by the Maronite Christians. There were tensions
                    between the Maronites and the Lebanese Sunni and the Shiites - the Muslims
                    groups. The Sunnis had some influence at the time; the Shiites practically none.
                    These tensions were evident in the early 1970s although they had not yet
                    exploded in open combat. The Maronites opposed strongly all Palestinian
                    activities withiLebanon; they would have preferred to have the Palestinians
                    leave the country. The Sunnis on the other hand defended the Palestinians. The
                    division of political power [between Christians and Muslims] was based on a
                    census that had taken place decades earlier, which was obviously outdated, but
                    was accepted by all parties as politically expedient. As I said, the tensions
                    were beneath the surface.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>My wife and I had been in Beirut about two weeks when we were invited for dinner
                    at his house by a Maronite deputy, who lived about half way up the mountain
                    which separated Beirut from Alay. The deputy's son and daughter - both in their
                    20s - joined us for dinner and we had a wonderful evening. We spoke French, had
                    French wine, French food. The son had graduated from a law school in Paris; the
                    daughter was a graduate of a French medical school. After dinner, former
                    President Chamoun joined us along with some of his militiamen - all dressed in
                    their “tiger” suits. They sat down and had a great time reminiscing about the
                    events of the previous year; they had used this house to plan and conduct an
                    ambush of a Palestinian funeral courtege that was winding its way back to Beirut
                    from the Bekaa Valley. A few hundred yards from this house was an S curve in the
                    mountainous road, which forced traffic to come almost to a full stop to navigate
                    the road. The Maronites at the dinner bragged how they had killed thirty
                    Palestinians and had wounded forty of them; they thought it had been a great
                    evening's work. I was flabbergasted; on the way home, I commented to Phyllis
                    that I could not comprehend how civilized our hosts had been and yet at the same
                    time could relish their participation in a human slaughter. I had a hard time
                    comprehending this dichotomy in their personality. At the time, as I have said,
                    open internal hostilities amongst Lebanese had not yet broken out, but that
                    evening was a real lesson for me about what was going on beneath the apparent
                    calm political atmosphere in Lebanon. I was also convinced that the Chamoun
                    appearance, which caught me entirely by surprise, was obviously staged for my
                    benefit as was the after dinner conversation. This bizarre episode left an
                    impression; no doubt about that. I wondered what kind of a strange world Lebanon
                    really was - from a civilized French atmosphere one minute to the middle ages
                    the next!</p>
                <p>This Lebanese chameleon quality repeated itself several times during our tour.
                    One faction or another was always trying to impress us with their power. In the
                    story I just related, not only was I meant to understand the Maronite power, but
                    obviously I was also to be impressed by the deputy's relationship to Chamoun.
                    All of us Americans at the Embassy were courted by the various Lebanese factions
                    and individuals. The U.S. was viewed as a mighty power and the Christians, at
                    least, as well as some Sunnis who were part of the establishment hoped - and
                    some probably really believed - that we would protect them. The French were
                    similarly viewed as protectors of the status quo. Of course, we were also viewed
                    as the “issuers of visas” - a commodity in great demand.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We were always being solicited by one group or another to intercede on its
                    behalf. I remember that on one occasion, the Station Chief and I sat down to
                    discuss the political situation. We agreed that the U.S. would be very wise not
                    to have any direct linkages to any of the political groups. CIA, based on the
                    Station Chief's recommendations, directed that direct, covert relationships with
                    certain Christian groups, which had been in existence for years and years, be
                    terminated. The Phalange was the group that had had the closest relationship to
                    the CIA. I thought that the Agency had taken the right action because we had
                    come to the conclusion that - given the widespread foreign involvement in
                    Lebanon political affairs - including the Egyptians, the Israelis, the Saudis,
                    the Syrians, the Iraqis, the Iranians and others - the more we became involved
                    with one group or another the less influence we would have overall because other
                    powers would more than match our own efforts, thereby starting a race for
                    influence that we could probably not win. Therefore, it became clear to us that
                    the wiser course was for the U.S. to keep its distance from all groups and
                    appear to be more of a neutral observer and not so much an active participant in
                    Lebanese politics.</p>
                <p>I might just describe an incident at this stage which illustrates my point. One
                    of the owners of a large English-language newspaper invited the Oakleys to have
                    dinner with him. Phyllis and I had a great conversation with him. At one stage,
                    he began to complain how the U.S. was corrupting the freedom of the Lebanese
                    press by funneling assistance to one or another of his competitors. I explained
                    to him, as emphatically as I could, that history notwithstanding, I could
                    categorically assure him that at that time neither the CIA nor any other part of
                    the U.S. government was providing any funds or assistance to any Lebanese
                    newspapers. The next morning, I got a note from him suggesting that since we
                    were not supporting any of his rivals, would we consider putting some money into
                    his newspaper!</p>
                <p>There were a lot of myths about the U.S. in Lebanon at the time. That had been
                    historically true and was true for many years after I left. We had no hopes of
                    killing the rumors and the misperceptions, but we hoped that we might change the
                    realities. The Station Chief was instrumental in this effort. When one of his
                    people was transferred, the replacement never picked up his predecessor's links
                    to certain Lebanese individuals. It was easier for the Political Section because
                    we had never had any operational role and therefore under the new U.S. policy
                    did not have to change our behavior. Tom Carolan was my deputy; he was a
                    wonderful “Arabist”. He was very useful; he finally managed to restore the Arab
                    language training program in Beirut. He was also instrumental in restoring a
                    program of Arab specialists in the Foreign Service when he joined the Office of
                    Personnel after his tour in Lebanon.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Despite the surface calm, we were always concerned about the political stability
                    of Lebanon. The problems in Lebanon revolved around four factors: religion,
                    personalities, outside meddling of other governments in support of specific
                    factions and ambitions for power. These four factors played off against each
                    other. It was an obvious cauldron waiting to boil over. There was always some
                    unease because there were many small clashes and frictions between groups - even
                    within the Muslim and Christian communities. In 1972, there was a major
                    confrontation between the PLO and the Lebanese government, which could have
                    reached the level of intensity that occurred in 1970 when the King of Jordan had
                    to order his army out against the PLO there. The seeds of Lebanese confrontation
                    started in the South where the PLO had increasingly assumed the functions of a
                    sovereign power. They had their own road blocks; they chased the Lebanese army
                    and police out of the area. Finally two good friends of mine - the Army's
                    Assistant Chief for Intelligence and the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations
                    - persuaded the Army Chief who in turn persuaded the President of Lebanon to
                    allow them to conduct a raid on the PLO headquarters, which was then located in
                    the refugee camps at Sabra and Shatila - located between downtown Beirut and the
                    international airport. The President stewed over the recommendation for a long
                    time; he finally approved. The Lebanese army began its sweep at noon of the
                    appointed day. By six that afternoon, they had gone through about 2/3 of the
                    camps, inflicting about a dozen Palestinian casualties while suffering three or
                    four army losses. The army, composed of members of many Lebanese communities -
                    Shiites, Sunnis, Druse, Maronites - held together admirably. The soldiers fought
                    side by side as a single unit. There was no unrest whatsoever in the rest of
                    Lebanon; in fact, most people were relieved that the government was finally
                    taking a strong stand against the PLO. President Franjieh was approached that
                    afternoon by all Arab ambassadors who complained bitterly about the army's
                    actions. By seven that evening, he lost his nerve and recalled his troops from
                    the camps. Included among the ambassadors was the Syrian, but in the early 1970s
                    Syria did not have the sway over Lebanon that it subsequently mustered.</p>
                <p>In June 1972 - a month after this raid - the Political Section managed to get a
                    hold of a PLO “after-action” report. It admitted that the raid had almost been
                    totally successful in destroying the PLO chain of command because it had all
                    been centralized in Sabra-Shatila. The conclusion of this report was that the
                    PLO headquarters would have to spread out into other camps and neighborhoods,
                    especially the poor ones in Beirut which were mostly filled by the Shiites and
                    some Sunnis. The arm caches were to be disbursed in many neighborhoods. The PLO
                    was to open small offices in many neighborhoods to recruit and decentralize
                    their operations. This same report also concluded that the PLO needed to obtain
                    greater support from the Syrians, who had not raised a finger during the recent
                    confrontation. It was also stated that the PLO had to be much more vigilant
                    about the Lebanese army because the raid might occur again.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The President's decision also had an impact on the Christian communities. The
                    more aggressive, such as the Phalange, came to the conclusion that the
                    government then in power did not have sufficient backbone and the army was too
                    weak to impose its will. The conclusion reached was that the Christian community
                    would have to look to its own resources to protect its interests; that meant
                    that Christian officers and men had to be pulled out of the army and assigned to
                    the Christian militias. The inconclusive raid on Sabra-Shatila therefore became
                    one of the key points in the unraveling of the Lebanese country; the splintering
                    really began after that. I therefore consider summer of 1972 to have been the
                    time when Lebanon really began to fall apart as a nation.</p>
                <p>The U.S. refused to provide any significant military assistance to the Lebanese
                    army. We provided some small arms and equipment, but it was nothing like the
                    support we gave the Jordanian army in 1970. The Lebanese wanted the same
                    treatment; we never did reply to their request. So military assistance became a
                    major issue in our relations with Lebanon. I think we should have provided some
                    arms and equipment - limited, but more than we were willing to do. I looked at
                    the issue as a political one and felt that greater assistance was required to
                    shore up the Lebanese army against the PLO, and to shore up President Franjieh.
                    But at that stage Washington was preoccupied with other issues; furthermore,
                    probably the other Arab governments would have objected to an increased
                    assistance program to the Lebanese army to use against Palestinians. So
                    Washington's decision was not to get involved.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Sabra-Shatila. I visited them as well as other refugee camps. I never
                    saw any hostile reaction by the people living there. But it was obvious that
                    these camps were and would increasingly be the breeding ground for major
                    problems. They were obviously over-crowded and suffering from the lack of
                    infrastructure and employment. But having served in Africa, I probably did not
                    have as strong a reaction than others might have had. But the contrast between
                    the camps and the rest of the Beirut was noticeable. Of course, the camps tended
                    to be in poor neighborhoods, which made the contrast not quite as stark. The
                    presence of refugee camps, the poor neighborhoods, the glitter of certain parts
                    of Beirut just accented the wide gaps in the socio-economic conditions of the
                    various elements of Lebanese society. Everybody understood that these wide
                    discrepancies - particularly the refugee camps - would sooner or later be the
                    kindling points for a major conflagration.</p>
                <p>The only major assistance agency was UNRWA - a UN refugee assistance program. But
                    in general, the Lebanese government was not interested in using its own funds or
                    as a matter of fact having any other government or institution using their
                    resources to alleviate the poverty in the camps. A lot of the refugees had been
                    chased out of Jordan into Lebanon in 1970; they had crossed into Jordan from the
                    West bank after the 1967 war. But in the early 1970s, the world's major powers
                    had other fish to fry; they had not become fully aware of the ticking time bomb
                    that was Lebanon. Alarm about terrorism had not yet reached the level when it
                    could have provoked the major powers into action. There was a hijacking of
                    aircraft and smaller terrorist actions, but the scope of terrorist activity had
                    not yet reached the crisis point it would later.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Some of the terrorism came from Iraqi and Syrian agents fighting each other in
                    the streets of Beirut. In the early 1970s, both Iraq and Syria vied for
                    influence in Lebanon and especially about who would be the leader of the Baath
                    Party. The two countries tried to resolve that issue by fighting in Lebanon;
                    that was true for many Arab disputes - they were settled in the streets of
                    Beirut. For example, the Iraqis and the Iranians were fighting for control of
                    the Shiite population. Lebanon's wealth and influence made it an attractive
                    target for foreign manipulations. I pointed out to one of my Lebanese friends
                    one day that almost every Arab country was trying to have some influence in one
                    or another of Lebanon's political parties. Each Arab country also seemed to have
                    a stake in one or another of Lebanon's newspapers. These Arab countries were
                    smuggling arms and money into Lebanon. I wondered whether my friend was not
                    concerned about this foreign interference. He said: “No, not in the least. It is
                    great for trade. You don't understand our history. We have always had an 'open
                    door' policy which permitted all sorts of different groups into Lebanon. We
                    calculate that these groups cancel each other out - and that no single one will
                    be the most powerful and influential. In the process, we get rich!” It was a
                    very benign view of the world which I suspect the Lebanese may have later
                    regretted.</p>
                <p>I had an interesting commercial experience. One of the major Lebanese banks,
                    which collapsed, was owned in part by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). In
                    fact, CCC was the bank's biggest stockholder, followed by the government of
                    Lebanon. The bank had a well-deserved reputation for being less than above
                    board; so when it collapsed, no great harm was done, except that the U.S. was
                    left holding the bag. Donald Nixon's son - the President's nephew - came to
                    Beirut with an entourage which included an American wheeler-dealer. They wanted
                    to buy the bank. There was a difference of opinion in the Embassy. There was a
                    group, primarily the economic-commercial officers who wanted to let the deal go
                    through. Buffum and I had great reservations; we didn't like the “smell” of it.
                    We knew that the bank had been corrupt and that the man accompanying Nixon's
                    nephew also did not have a savory reputation. We were trying to clean up the
                    bank so that it could pay its debts to the legitimate customers. We weren't sure
                    that the American buyers had the same concerns. So we plotted to have the
                    Agricultural Attache, who represented the CCC, and the government of Lebanon
                    postpone the offer. The bank's board met every month. After the first meeting
                    after the offer was tendered, the Ambassador was approached by the Legal Attach�
                    [the FBI representative] who had a message from Mitchell, the Attorney General.
                    The message requested that the board at its next meeting give more favorable
                    consideration to the Nixon offer. There was also a call from Haldeman's office
                    in the White House, making the same request. But we decided to stick to the “no
                    action” scenario.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>It was not much later that “Watergate” hit the headlines. We sent back an
                    “innocent” cable to the Department saying that we had heard from Mitchell and
                    Haldeman, via their intermediaries. We said that our policy was to treat the
                    Nixon offer as we would that proffered by any American businessman. We then
                    added that if the Department wished to have the matter treated differently, it
                    should issue appropriate instructions to us. It was obvious that our message
                    seemed to have hit a sore spot because we heard a lot of squawking and noise; we
                    understood that the Attorney General's office denied that Mitchell had ever been
                    involved. We had created a huge flap in Washington. We heard no more about the
                    matter.</p>
                <p>We had no contact with Israeli agents in Lebanon. One night, some Israeli
                    commandos landed on the beaches of Beirut, found their way into town, killed
                    three prominent PLO leaders and blew up an apartment building in the center of
                    the city. They were never caught. We were accused of having facilitated their
                    departure because it was popularly believed that when they retreated, they
                    entered the Embassy compound and used a tunnel that led to the sea, where a
                    submarine was waiting to pick them up. Otherwise, I don't think the Israelis
                    were a factor in Lebanon in the early 1970s.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Before concluding this discussion of my tour in Lebanon, I would like to make a
                    personal observation about which I feel very strongly. Having watched the U.S.
                    in various places around the world - Vietnam, Sudan etc - I observed that the
                    U.S. periodically made commitments to individuals and groups; then when these
                    people got in trouble, we did not stand behind our commitments. I strongly
                    believe that this was and is very poor policy. I drew a personal lesson from
                    this observation which influenced me for the rest of my diplomatic career; I
                    swore that as long as I had anything to do with policy development, I would
                    never fall into that error. I made a special effort in subsequent assignments
                    not to mislead others about support they might expect. That is why I worked with
                    the Station Chief to bring our activities in Lebanon back to where I thought
                    they should be; i.e. neutrality. Before I left Beirut in 1974, I made a point of
                    calling on people like Chamoun, Gemayel, and other Lebanese leaders to say my
                    farewells. I had known most of them as personal friends. In my farewell call, I
                    told each that I hoped that they were not under a mistaken belief that the U.S.
                    would send its military forces into Lebanon to help one faction or another. I
                    predicted that such event would never occur. I opined that neither the French or
                    the British would intervene militarily. I suggested to each of the leaders that
                    they behave in the future with this cautionary note in mind. I added that I
                    thought that Lebanon had a good future, even though after the 1973 war, there
                    had been a lot of changes in the Middle East and in Lebanon. I was referring to
                    the fact that Syria was stronger than it had been, that Saudi Arabia was opening
                    its country to foreign investment, but I thought that nevertheless that if
                    Lebanon could stabilize its internal political tensions, it could balance the
                    interests of the Syrians, the Saudis and the Egyptians in such a way that it
                    would work to Lebanon's importance. But if the Lebanese continued to maintain
                    that they were the bastion of Western civilization, that would be a huge mistake
                    which would not sit well with their Arab neighbors. Then I repeated my
                    prediction that if Lebanon was counting on U.S. military support in the event of
                    an Arab attack, that would just compound their error in judgement. Most of my
                    interlocutors didn't believe me; they were sure that the U.S. would come to
                    Lebanon's aid. I repeated my prediction that we would not - and as history
                    shows, we didn't.</p>
                <p>Before closing my comments on my Beirut assignment, I should mention that one of
                    my jobs there was liaison with the PLO - not directly with Arafat, but with some
                    of his lieutenants - particularly with a Palestinian professor at the American
                    University. I acted on Washington instructions. At one point, the professor and
                    I were the intermediaries in the exchange of papers between Kissinger and
                    Arafat. The papers were “non-papers”; that is to say, they had no identifying
                    marks. There was no heading nor a signature. But they were messages that we and
                    the professor exchanged in Beirut. This was later revealed by a PLO defector who
                    joined the Popular Front of the Liberation of Palestine using this exchange as
                    one of the reasons he left the PLO because it allegedly showed to him that
                    Arafat was too close to the US. I think in the period we were discussing, I was
                    only one channel to the PLO. Undoubtedly we ran some intelligence operations,
                    but I think I was the only official channel to the PLO. When my operation became
                    public, Kissinger was furious and was blaming me, but I pointed out that I could
                    not be held responsible for PLO defectors who leaked information given to them
                    by Arafat.</p>

                <p>Q: Then in 1974, you were transferred to Washington to take on the job as the
                    senior staffer on the Middle East on the Department's Policy Planning staff
                    [S/P].</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had not sought the S/P assignment; I knew it was time for me to have a
                    Washington assignment and I was satisfied with the S/P offer particularly since
                    I would be working on Middle East issues. I knew the issues and most of the
                    Washington players, like Sisco, Atherton and Saunders. I stayed in the Policy
                    Planning Staff for about six months, which actually started with an assignment
                    of six weeks in Geneva where the U.S. and USSR were co-chairing the talks on the
                    Middle East. We kept stringing the Soviets along promising more meetings in
                    Geneva - while Kissinger was conducting his “shuttle diplomacy” first with Egypt
                    and then with Syria. One of the goals of the “shuttle diplomacy” was to keep the
                    Soviets out of the Middle East. The Geneva “talks” were essentially a sop to the
                    Soviets who kept complaining that they were being left out of Middle East
                    affairs, although nominally they co-chair of a group that was established to
                    bring some settlement to the area. In order to make it appear that the U.S. had
                    some interest in keeping Geneva going, I was sent there from Beirut as sort of
                    an advance man - somewhat as a decoy to make the Soviets feel that we were
                    interested in some cooperative action with them. I was pretty sure that no
                    meetings would be held in Geneva, but my job was to make it appear that I was
                    busily engaged in preparations for those meetings. In fact, I sat around for
                    most of the six weeks doing little while appearing to be very busy. There would
                    be occasional meetings with the Soviets, just to keep up the pretense, but no
                    serious business was ever transacted. For those six weeks, I was the lone U.S.
                    representative to the Middle East talks to be held in Geneva.</p>
                <p>After actually reporting to the Department, I participated soon after my arrival
                    in a Palestinian Working Group which was the first U.S. government effort to
                    study that group in depth. The working group had on it people like Hal Saunders
                    who had worked on the Middle East for some time and academics and other outside
                    experts like Joe Johnson. I don't think we came to any revolutionary
                    conclusions, but several of Israel's friends were somewhat upset by our
                    report.</p>
                <p>Most of my work consisted of participating with others as a support group for
                    Kissinger as his Middle East policy evolved. Bill Quandt was with Hal Saunders
                    in the NSC, but was phasing out. They and Roy Atherton, the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary in NEA, Joe Sisco, then the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, and
                    I acted as a think-tank on Middle East policy and fed ideas to Kissinger. We
                    were planning for a disengagement agreement for Jordan; that had top priority in
                    our policy. That agreement never came to fruition as Kissinger explains in his
                    “Memoirs” because it was just politically too difficult, even though we had
                    promised it to the King of Jordan. Eventually, we began to focus on a second
                    disengagement agreement for Egypt. All of these efforts are covered in some
                    detail in Quandt's and Saunders' writings.</p>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Because of my work for the Policy Planning Staff, I found myself
                    collaborating with Joe Sisco once again. As I have said earlier, I had worked
                    for Joe when he was the Director for UN Political Affairs and then later when I
                    was at the UN. It just so happened, that in 1974, Cyprus was a hot issue.
                    Responsibility for that country as well as Greece and Turkey had just been
                    transferred from NEA to EUR. EUR, as the new boy on the block, didn't know how
                    to handle the crisis. In the area, there were many signs pointing to the
                    possibility of a real war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. EUR was lost
                    and Sisco stepped in to manage U.S. policy. He asked me to join his crisis
                    management team. I said that I had my hands full with Middle East problems. Joe,
                    inhis inimitable fashion said: “I know you, Bob, and I can work with you. Let's
                    go!”</p>
                <p>So we started on a trip to the region - Joe and I and several people from EUR and
                    IO. Bill Buffum had by this time returned from Lebanon and was the Assistant
                    Secretary of IO; he and Joe had worked closely together before and would do so
                    again on the Cyprus problem. We were trying to prevent a war between Greece and
                    Turkey. I am happy to say that we were successful. The trip was very
                    interesting. It was plain that the Greek military junta was being very tough;
                    the Turks were on the verge of moving. Our first stop was Athens where we argued
                    that the Greeks should make some concessions to the Turks. Those few days in
                    Athens were unforgettable. First we were briefed by the Embassy, including the
                    CIA. The latter had said previously that they had assurances from Dimitrios
                    Ioannidis, the power behind the Junta, that the Greeks would not take any action
                    against Makarios on Cyprus - there had been earlier some concern on our part
                    that the Greeks would take some action against the Archbishop. After having
                    those assurances, the U.S. relaxed until we found one morning that in fact the
                    Greeks had taken action precipitating the crisis. So when we arrived in Athens,
                    the CIA was already shaken. It was also clear that Ambassador Tasca was very
                    much under the influence of the Station Chief. He didn't have a DCM - he had in
                    effect eliminated the position. He told us that the U.S. had to intervene by
                    bringing the Sixth Fleet into that part of the Mediterranean, as we had done in
                    an earlier Cyprus crisis. If we did not bring our military power to bear, Tasca
                    predicted that the Greeks would attack Turkey. Sisco and I looked at him
                    unbelievingly; it was clear to us that regardless of Ioannidis braggadocio, he
                    was not stupid enough to attack the powerful Turkey directly. Tasca would not
                    change his tune and insisted the Sixth Fleet be brought off shore; that was the
                    Station's line and Tasca had bought it lock, stock and barrel. There was no way
                    the U.S. would do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We kept trying and trying to see the real leaders of the Junta; our first
                    conversations were only with the nominal government leaders. After many tries,
                    we were finally escorted through a large crowd of security people into the
                    principal government building in downtown Athens. That building was guarded not
                    only by uniformed personnel, but cops and security people in civilian clothing.
                    We were taken to the basement of the building. There we began to talk again with
                    the nominal leadership. After about half an hour, Ioannidis walked in - as I
                    said, he was the real power behind the Junta. He said that the Greeks would not
                    make anymore concessions; they had gone as far as they would.</p>
                <p>So we went to Ankara, essentially with empty bags having come to the conclusions
                    that a) the Greeks were immobilized, thereby inviting a Turkish attack on Cyprus
                    and b) the Greeks were not about to attack Turkey - despite CIA's and Tasca's
                    predictions. But we went to Ankara anyway to see whether we could talk the Turks
                    from taking action. We didn't have much hope of swaying the Turks, but we had to
                    try to avert war. Paul Hare was with us in charge of our public affairs. On one
                    morning, at 3 a.m. we were sitting in Prime Minister [Bulent] Ecevit's office,
                    when he came in saying: “I have just been to our National Security Council
                    meeting where we agreed that we have no choice except to go to the assistance of
                    our brothers on Cyprus. Our ships will land on the Cyprus beaches in three
                    hours.” He looked at Hare and said: “I remember your father was involved in a
                    prior similar situation. At that time, the U.S. assured us that it would take
                    care of the interests of the Turkish minority on Cyprus if we refrained from
                    military action. There was a second situation when the same promise was made. In
                    both cases, you did nothing. Now the situation for our people on Cyprus is even
                    worse; so this time we will go our way, not yours!” After that, there was
                    nothing more we could do; so we rushed to the airport and took off just before
                    the airport was closed to all civilian traffic.</p>
                <p>We went back to Athens. After the military debacle on Cyprus - the Greeks having
                    been pushed around by the Turkish army - we found Admiral Arapakis - the Chief
                    of the Navy and a member of the Junta - who was willing to sign a cease-fire
                    agreement that we had worked out. We believed that the Turks would also sign. In
                    fact, the Admiral was the only member of the Junta who could still be found; the
                    rest had disappeared. We later found out that the Junta had planned to bring
                    back Karamanlis, a popular Greek leader who at the time was exiled in Paris. The
                    Junta was going to bring him back and have him sign the cease fire agreement.
                    After having signed that humiliating piece of paper, the Junta was going to try
                    to defame Karamanlis and make a comeback.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But we did not want to wait for too long; we insisted that some Greek leader sign
                    the cease fire right then and there. We waited for three days to find a Greek
                    leader who could sign the cease fire. It just happened that one of the Embassy's
                    local employees was a nephew of Admiral Arapakis. He took us to his uncle's
                    house in the middle of the night; the Admiral agreed to sign, but only after he
                    had talked to Kissinger. We called the Department and the duty officer was
                    finally able to track the Secretary down - he was having dinner with his wife
                    and Winston and Betty Lord at the Empress Restaurant. Kissinger, in his usual
                    fashion, got on the phone and said: “Sisco, what the hell do you want?” Joe told
                    him that he had to talk to the Admiral; Henry objected; he wanted to return to
                    his fine Chinese dinner. Finally grudgingly, Kissinger agreed to talk to the
                    Admiral who then also agreed to sign the cease fire agreement - the Greeks were
                    ready to stop hostilities.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that it took us three days to find the Admiral. When we arrived in
                    Athens on a Friday afternoon, Ambassador Tasca announced that he was having
                    house guests and therefore he could not invite Joe to the Residence, as he had
                    on the previous visit. So Sisco slept in Tasca's office; I slept in the DCM's
                    office for the week-end.</p>
                <p>On Monday morning, the Administrative Officer decided that he had to talk to Joe
                    about some internal Embassy problem. That led me to suggest that we had been in
                    Athens too long. I said that since we had just gotten the Admiral's agreement we
                    had better leave before the Embassy decided that the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs was there to sort out all sorts of minor details. I should
                    note that we didn't see Tasca for the whole week-end; he entertained his guests,
                    while Joe and his delegation ran around Athens looking for any member of the
                    Junta to stop the war.</p>
                <p>Then it was time to tackle the Turks again. But they wouldn't give clearance to
                    our plane. They knew why we were coming back to Ankara and they weren't really
                    willing to stop their military advances quite yet. They were moving forward, but
                    had not gone as far on the island as their schedule had called for. Sisco called
                    Ambassador Macomber from the Athens airport. He told the Ambassador to see the
                    Foreign Minister immediately and to have the Defense Attach� see the Chief of
                    Staff with the message that we were not going to tolerate anymore stalling. Joe
                    said that we were taking off immediately for Turkey; we would be in Turkish
                    airspace in an hour. If the Turks wanted to shoot down the personal
                    representative of the President of the United States, they could do so.
                    Otherwise he would land in Ankara. Our pilots were extremely nervous; they
                    wanted to know what they were to do once we had gotten near Turkish airspace
                    without clearance. Sisco told them that if we had not received clearance to land
                    by that time, we would circle.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>About five minutes before we were to leave Greek airspace, we got our clearance.
                    Not only that, but once we got into Turkish airspace, the Turks provided us with
                    fighter escorts to lead us in to Ankara. After landing we had to find Turkish
                    Prime Minister Ecevit. Macomber's repeated calls were not being answered. Sisco
                    finally remembered that he had a friend in the Turkish government from his days
                    at the UN. The Turkish friend at the time was an Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs at the Foreign Office. Sisco told me to go upstairs with him to try to
                    find his friend. Downstairs, there was a large group of Embassy officer sitting
                    around a circle debating what we should do next - that was Macomber's decision
                    making process. Sisco became frustrated with this approach. He beckoned me to
                    step outside the room and to get his friend on the phone. I was a member of S/P;
                    I had not worked on Turkey and didn't have the slightest idea who the officials
                    were. Anyway, I put a call in to the Under Secretary. I told him that I had to
                    have a call back within thirty minutes confirming that Sisco had an appointment
                    with the Prime Minister. Otherwise, Sisco would leave and return to the U.S. and
                    tell everyone that the Turkish Prime Minister would not receive the personal
                    representative of the President of the US. Within twenty minutes, the Under
                    Secretary called; he told me to tell Joe that he had arranged a meeting with the
                    Foreign Minister. I objected and said that Joe didn't want to see the Foreign
                    Minister; he wanted to see the Prime Minister; no one less would do.
                    Nevertheless, the Under Secretary insisted that Joe come to the Foreign
                    Minister's office at 8:15 a.m. I asked whether this ploy would work; Joe's
                    Turkish friend expressed the hope that it would work.</p>
                <p>So we showed up at the Foreign Minister's office at the appointed hour. And the
                    Prime Minister showed up, coming in by a side door. He didn't want to be seen
                    meeting with Joe. In any case, the Turks finally agreed to sign the cease fire
                    agreement, but only after Sisco threatened to cease all assistance and withdraw
                    all support from Turkey. I should mention that Sisco had had the foresight to
                    call Kissinger the previous day to review what he would say; he was certain that
                    the Turks would monitor the conversation and therefore know that on the next
                    day, Sisco would not be bluffing. There was something else at work then and
                    again later on. Ecevit had been a [student] Professor Kissinger at Harvard.
                    Kissinger had a predisposition to believe that any of his students would
                    automatically do his bidding. He was certain that Ecevit would not cause any
                    problems because of this professor-student relationship. Of course, it didn't
                    quite work out that way, at least initially. But the Prime Minister knew that
                    Sisco had Kissinger's approval to a complete cut off of assistance and that
                    finally convinced them to sign the cease fire agreement.</p>
                <p>As we were flying home, Sisco commented that in light of our experiences in
                    Athens, we had to find a DCM - whether Tasca liked it or not. That would then
                    have in place someone who could act as Charg� after Tasca's removal. When Joe
                    returned to Washington, he sent a note to Kissinger about Tasca's political
                    naivete as well as his behavior. Joe was outraged by what he found in Athens; he
                    had not been advised by how bad the situation there had been. When Kissinger
                    agreed to get Tasca out, the Department found Monty Stearns in the backwoods of
                    Maine, where he was vacationing. Monty was shipped out within two days as the
                    unrequested DCM; a week later Tasca was recalled.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I traveled twice more on the Cyprus issue. The first time I went with Buffum to
                    meet the British, the Turks and Greeks to work on a proposal which had been
                    essentially drafted by the Turks. It established a series of “Cantons” in Cyprus
                    intended to settle the dispute on the ground, going beyond the cease fire. It
                    would have ratified the situation that existed at the time the cease fire was
                    signed and turn the situation into a permanent settlement. We worked on this
                    document laboriously and tabled the draft. We returned to Washington when the
                    Greeks refused to accept the draft.</p>
                <p>The second time I went to the area with Art Hartman, the Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs; we were a delegation of two. It was in August, 1974. Before we
                    left, we were instructed by Kissinger who told us that “some things may happen
                    in Washington while you are gone.” He never said or hinted what that was. But he
                    said that we were to tell each and every foreign official we saw that regardless
                    of what might be happening in Washington or what they may be perceiving as
                    happening in Washington, the U.S. would react very strongly to any provocation
                    or interference with our goals - he said that he meant the Soviets especially,
                    but the same U.S. policy would apply to any foreign power. Neither Art or I had
                    any idea to what Kissinger might be referring.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Our first stop was Cyprus where we met Ambassador Roger Davies and talked with
                    Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader and other Cypriots. This was just a couple of
                    days before Ambassador Davies was assassinated. Clerides told us that as Greek
                    Cypriot, he understood what was happening in Athens, where the Foreign Minister
                    was totally under the sway of Archbishop Makarios, who at the time was in exile
                    in London; they did not want a Cyprus agreement. Prime Minister Karamanlis was
                    too weak to obtain the Greek Parliament's approval without Makarios' blessing
                    and the support of the Communist Party. Clerides predicted that the Greeks would
                    not accept the proposal on the table at the time. In Ankara, it became clear to
                    us that the Turks were reaching the limit of their patience; they were
                    increasingly bellicose. As Clerides had predicted, Karamanlis was not willing to
                    accept the proposal which would have established a cantonal arrangement. We met
                    the British Foreign Secretary in Geneva; he said he had an intelligence report
                    that predicted that in five days, the Turkish forces would move beyond the cease
                    fire line in an effort to capture all of the territory on the island that they
                    originally had intended to take. That report rang true in light of the mood we
                    had sensed in Ankara. The Foreign Secretary suggested that the British move a
                    squadron of [F-4] “Phantom” aircraft to Cyprus in an effort to deter the Turks
                    from further aggression. He wanted U.S. approval. So we sent a cable to
                    Kissinger; the answer was that our intelligence community had no such
                    information and therefore Washington did not find the British report credible.
                    Back we went by cable suggesting that we believed the British report to be
                    plausible and that the U.S. should support the British. Time passed and we could
                    not get a reply, despite Art's pleadings. He called [Larry] Eagleburger and told
                    him that something had to be done. Larry told him that he didn't understand what
                    was going in Washington; i.e. Kissinger's total preoccupation with Watergate and
                    the President's position. Sure enough, on the day predicted by the British, the
                    Turks moved - which said something about our intelligence and about the chaos in
                    Washington in August, 1974. While in Geneva, we watched Nixon's resignation and
                    his departure from the White House. That made the trip especially memorable. We
                    then also understood better why we had such a hard time getting any meaningful
                    responses from Washington, and what Kissinger had meant when he talked to us
                    before our departure..</p>
                <p>I must say that this experience left me personally very pessimistic about Cyprus.
                    To this day, I do not see a solution that would be acceptable to all parties. I
                    noticed that Dick Holbrooke said last week that he was going to make one last
                    effort to settle the dispute. I think that even suggesting that he would take a
                    crack at it might be a mistake; there is very little hope of any success. As far
                    as I am concerned, that is a “no win” issue. I think we may well be posturing on
                    Cyprus, as I was doing in Geneva, as I described earlier. We seem to be
                    generating a lot of activity without any serious thought about accomplishing
                    much except to maintain a posture of activism. I hope that we will not be fooled
                    into thinking that we can have much influence on the Cyprus dispute; I don't
                    think we can produce a settlement, at least in the foreseeable future. The main
                    risk is that U.S. representatives who do get involved come to believe that they
                    might have an effect; that only brings on greater frustration without any
                    accomplishments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Soon after that you joined the National Security Council.
                        How dithat happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: One day, in September, I believe, Win Lord, then the head of S/P called
                    me into his office and told me that he and Kissinger had had dinner the night
                    before and the Secretary had decided upon the transfer. Hal Saunders had left
                    the NSC to join the Department as Roy Atherton's - the Assistant Secretary for
                    NEA - deputy for the Middle East peace process. Kissinger had been unable to
                    find a qualified replacement for Hal and therefore had decided that I should
                    move from S/P to the NSC. I was happy to make the switch. This was the period
                    when Kissinger was both Secretary of State and the NSC Advisor. Brent Scowcroft
                    was the Deputy NSC Advisor - he became the Advisor when Kissinger decided to
                    become the Secretary of State exclusively.</p>
                <p>My first experience in the NSC was a real revelation. I found that the CIA Middle
                    East “experts” who would not give me the time of day when I was in S/P, were
                    deluging me with attention and information as soon as I moved to the NSC. They
                    were very eager to help. I asked them where they had been while I was in S/P. I
                    pointed out to them that the U.S. “Middle East” team remained the same; we might
                    be in somewhat different positions, but Sisco, Atherton, Saunders and I were
                    still the main parts of the team. It is true that my transfer out of S/P did
                    reduce that Office's involvement in Middle East affairs, but the basic team was
                    left intact. My role may have changed to some degree, but I was as much of the
                    team while in S/P as I was in the NSC. The same people traveled with Kissinger
                    on his “shuttles” and were part of his diplomacy planning team. Where these
                    individuals might have been shown on an organization chart was really
                    immaterial; the Middle East “team” consisted of a small group who would have
                    been members of it regardless of their assignment. Kissinger undoubtedly felt
                    comfortable with the four or five members of the “team” and couldn't really care
                    less where they were formally assigned.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>My first “shuttle” trip was really memorable; I almost got fired and almost got
                    Sisco fired. It was a great start! It took place in 1974. I was eager to make my
                    mark and had not fully comprehended the extent of Kissinger's sensitivities. On
                    our flight out, Kissinger came back - as he rarely did - to the working area of
                    the aircraft. I made a remark - just to show the NSC Advisor how smart I was -
                    about something that Sisco had told us in confidence about the negotiations.
                    Kissinger exploded; Joe had to go to the forward compartment and almost on
                    bended knees ask for forgiveness. He probably told Kissinger that I had
                    overheard him when he was dictating a telegram which recorded what he had been
                    told in confidence. Sisco no doubt said that he was very sorry indeed for this
                    “breach” and that he had not told me or anyone else what Henry had said in
                    confidence. Then Joe came back to the rear of the plane and proceeded to just
                    take my hide off. I then understood the game that Kissinger and his cohorts had
                    played for a long time. Henry undoubtedly understood that mid-level officers
                    like myself needed to have certain information, but he did not want to know that
                    that information had been passed on from his very small inner circle and
                    certainly did not want it to go further. But the bottom line really was that
                    Kissinger did not want the information to go beyond the “need to know” line, and
                    was ferocious in enforcing secrecy. As I mentioned before, I had actually run
                    into this strange system before when I was in Paris being briefed by the French
                    in detail about a conversation that Ambassador Lucet had had with Kissinger
                    regarding the Middle East. I had reported this intelligence to Sisco who was
                    very grateful because, as he said, that was the first time he had found out in
                    detail what our Middle East policy was, as seen by the White House. There was
                    the Under Secretary of State relying on a report from Paris on U.S. Middle East
                    policy because the National Security Advisor never shared that information with
                    State Department officials. Hal Saunders performed superbly when he was at the
                    NSC in very discreetly passing information on a selected basis to the
                    appropriate officers in the Department even though he was under strict orders
                    not to. But it was a game that I was not aware of at first; I blabbed something
                    that I officially should not have known and that created a volcanic explosion.
                    It was a lesson that I did not forget! I have no doubt that Kissinger knew that
                    his strict instructions were being violated; he understood that the machinery of
                    government could not operate without some of confidential information being
                    passed on to the officials responsible for policy implementation, but Kissinger
                    just did not want to know that his “confidences” were being violated. It was a
                    game that we all played. It was fairly effective because it met Kissinger's real
                    goals; i.e. that the information not go beyond the minimum number of officials
                    who needed to know. As long as we knew that we had information that
                    theoretically we should not have had, you can rest assured that we made sure
                    that it didn't go beyond us.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I learned a lot of things from Kissinger - and Scowcroft later - which were quite
                    valuable. On that first “shuttle” I recognized the value of the Kissinger
                    process, which I think Hal Saunders was instrumental in creating. As I suspect
                    he has described in his oral history, before we left for a “shuttle” trip, we
                    would prepare briefing books - as the bureaucracy would do for a principal for
                    any foreign visit. The novel aspects of the process was that as we moved from
                    one stage to the next - from one meeting or one capital - the briefing books
                    would be updated with revisions based on the last conversation(s) and other new
                    information with a new “action check-list” developed to remind Kissinger what we
                    hoped would be accomplished at his next stop or meeting. These revisions were
                    made in time for the next flight, giving Kissinger an always up-to-date action
                    check list. The flights were usually short, although I remember one “shuttle”
                    that took us through Russia, South Asia, Iran and Saudi Arabia before landing in
                    Israel and doing the Middle East countries. But that was an exception; usually
                    we flew within a very circumscribed area in short hops.</p>
                <p>We would arrive usually in the morning; meet with various people or groups during
                    the whole day followed by a dinner or some other social event, after which we,
                    the staff, had to draft a report of the day's activities for Washington, an
                    update of the action check list and whatever else might be necessary to conduct
                    the following day's business. When Kissinger would wake up at 7 a.m. and ask for
                    his briefing books, he would find a completely updated version, and the draft
                    telegrams and report ready for his approval and despatch, as well as incoming
                    cables and intelligence reports. Then the daily routine would start all over
                    again: the flight, the meetings, the social event, the reports and the updating.
                    It was obviously very tiring, but the process forced us to think anew every day
                    about where we were going in light of the most recent events. We were busy with
                    the routine, but it in itself forced us to pause for some thinking, much of
                    which we did on the plane between landings. Most of the planning of course took
                    place before Kissinger and his team left Washington, but the process forced us
                    to update our views as well as the papers.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Let me give an illustration of “thinking while flying.” On one unexpected trip in
                    1974 back to the Middle East - following the Rabat Summit which took all
                    responsibility for Palestine from Jordan and gave it to the PLO after we had
                    assured the Israelis this wouldn't occur - we flew from Moscow to Kabul, where
                    we talked to the Afghan government, then on to Islamabad to talk to Prime
                    Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to New Delhi to talk to Prime Minister Ghandi, who
                    had just authorized the explosion of a nuclear device. Then on to Dacca to talk
                    to the new President of Bangladesh, Mujibur Rahman. Then on to Teheran and Saudi
                    Arabia for the Shah and the King. Kissinger was then scheduled to go to Rome to
                    represent the U.S. at the world's first food conference. Bob Hormats, who was
                    the NSC economic expert, was on the plane with us. He suggested that we should
                    try to marry U.S. farm technology with Middle East oil money to see whether that
                    combination might not alleviate world famine of the kind that we had seen in
                    Bangladesh. Bangladesh in 1974 was one of the most miserable places on earth;
                    this was soon after the war of secession and poverty was rampant - thousands of
                    people lying in the streets dying of hunger and poverty. So Hormats and some of
                    us put together a proposal while flying which eventually ended up becoming the
                    International Fund for Agricultural Development. The costs were shared between
                    the oil rich countries who provided the financial resources and the U.S. and
                    other Western countries which supplied the technical knowledge. This Fund is
                    still going today, but the idea was born on a “shuttle” flight because all of us
                    saw the need for it and because we were in a struggle with the French for
                    leadership of the North-South relations. The French were telling the “Third
                    World” that it was that world's principal supporter among the developed
                    countries and suggested that these countries work with France primarily. That
                    French position did not endear it to the U.S. and we wanted to take some
                    initiatives which would prove otherwise. So we came up with a practical proposal
                    which would be very helpful to the “Third World.” Kissinger discussed the
                    proposal with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and the Shah of Iran asking them to
                    provide the necessary financial resources in a partnership with President Ford.
                    He wanted the three countries to table the proposal together at the food
                    conference in Rome. Both the King and the Shah leapt at the opportunity to be
                    partners with the US; they readily promised to provide the money. They saw that
                    this was a “win-win” proposal for everybody. All the other countries were
                    astonished when Kissinger unveiled the proposal in Rome, particularly when the
                    package came so complete.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>This was an illustration of “thinking on the fly”, but the process in Washington
                    was incredibly difficult because it forced State, Treasury and Agriculture to
                    develop a brand new policy and find some resources. But it was done despite all
                    those ponderous bureaucracies. It was interesting to watch Kissinger operate in
                    such situations. Many of his speeches had considerable “meat” in them, and they
                    were never given without him being sure that he could deliver on any promises
                    that he may have made publicly. He would never have tabled his proposal in Rome
                    unless he was 100% sure that he had commitments from Washington for resources,
                    as well as from the Shah and King Faisal. He used his NSC position and his
                    relationship to the President to get other agencies of the government to agree
                    on a brand new proposal in a short period of time - a week! Within that time, he
                    had a new speech to give in Rome, a genuine helpful proposal which had the
                    support of the President of the US, the Shah of Iran and the King of Saudi
                    Arabia. No mean feat!</p>
                <p>I have been asked for my views of Kissinger's policy development style. I think
                    his process was a good one for him and the US. However, I was not one of
                    Kissinger's slavish admirers. After a meeting in Austria with Mubarak, one of us
                    in the delegation mused that the greatest foreign policy asset then available to
                    the U.S. was Henry Kissinger's mind and the greatest liability was his ego. So
                    the foreign policy process established by Kissinger was a good one while he ran
                    it; I am not sure that in the hands of others it would have served the U.S. as
                    well. Kissinger was extraordinary. Those professionals like Sisco, Atherton and
                    Saunders, who were in a constant dialogue with Kissinger - unlike me who
                    essentially only saw him on the airplane - occasionally saw the real Kissinger.
                    He rarely exposed his mind to others; there was not much dialogue with him. He
                    would speak to you and on occasion he would even listen to someone, but rarely
                    would there be a real dialogue. On rare occasions, I witnessed some “give and
                    take” and those were some of the most fascinating experiences in my life. It was
                    a wonder to watch Kissinger's mind at work; he could literally be thinking about
                    three different problems simultaneously, even though they might have been in
                    three different parts of the world. At the same time, he would be thinking about
                    history and the long term future. He had an extraordinary mind; I have never met
                    anyone who could think like Henry Kissinger. So the foreign policy process of
                    the 1970s was to serve Kissinger; as I said, it probably would not have suited
                    anyone else. Neither Shultz nor Baker could operate in the same way, but it
                    worked for Kissinger. So I had no problem with the Kissinger system because he
                    was able to stay on top of all the major issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>It is interesting to note that both Kissinger and Baker wanted complete control
                    of the foreign policy apparatus and process. Both were quite secretive; they
                    played their hands very close to the chest. But Kissinger could handle
                    considerably more problems - both in numbers and in scope - simultaneously than
                    Baker; the latter tended to pick and choose the most important and leave others
                    unattended. Kissinger had a rare capacity to cover the waterfront; he also was
                    willing to involve his assistant secretaries more in the process than was Baker.
                    Of course he arguably had the best set of professional Foreign Service officers
                    as assistant secretaries; that helped immeasurably. He was not willing to share
                    information and his views with anyone below an assistant secretary, but that was
                    a far wider collaboration than Baker who only talked to his immediate entourage
                    on the Seventh Floor - except under most unusual circumstances. So although
                    Kissinger and Baker seemed to operate in a similar fashion - very tight control
                    of the mechanism run by the Secretary and his immediate staff - their operations
                    were considerably different, stemming primarily from their very different
                    characteristics and personalities.</p>
                <p>I earlier mentioned that I learned some things from Brent Scowcroft. One
                    important lesson was to be thorough. Scowcroft was very meticulous and thorough.
                    Kissinger also had that trait, but he did not manage it as smoothly as Brent
                    did; Kissinger was much more abrupt. There is a story about Kissinger, which
                    might be apocryphal, when he was a Harvard professor. One of his students had
                    written two drafts of his PhD dissertation which had been sent back for further
                    work. When he submitted the third draft, it was returned with the notation: “Is
                    this the best you can do?” So after revising it yet again the student stormed
                    into Kissinger's office, protesting that the dissertation had been rewritten
                    three times and that he thought no one could do any better. Kissinger looked at
                    him for a while and then said: “Fine. Now I will read it!” Sometimes I felt like
                    the student must have, but Kissinger's pursuit of excellence was unremitting. He
                    forced me and others to think clearly, to write concisely, to make arguments
                    clear and logical. He certainly brought me to a level of achievement that I did
                    not think I could reach.</p>
                <p>Kissinger did bring out the best in people, but did it in a very nasty way. Vince
                    Lombardi had a similar approach when he coached football teams. A good coach can
                    inspire his team without being mean; some even use kindness. It is a function of
                    a coach's personality.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Back to Brent for a minute. He was not, as some people mistakenly thought, merely
                    a toady to Henry Kissinger. He had a mind of his own, which he used on occasions
                    to contradict Kissinger. He was very disciplined, very loyal. In my own case, he
                    saved me on one occasion from some dire consequences. One day in 1976 I got a
                    telephone call from Bob Houghton in State Personnel who wanted to know why I had
                    not reported to the Senior Seminar. I told him that I had been assigned to the
                    NSC and was staying there. He thought differently. His assignment sheet showed
                    me assigned to the Senior Seminar. I told him that that was news to me. I
                    couldn't figure out what had happened. So I went to see Scowcroft. I reminded
                    him that in a recent conversation he had led me to believe that he wanted me to
                    stay at the NSC through the end of 1976 - an election year. I told him that I
                    had agreed to stay, but I also thought that Kissinger might be furious with me -
                    that was the only reason that I could see why I might have been assigned to the
                    Senior Seminar. I told Brent that I would wait for him to tell me where I should
                    report; he would undoubtedly find out about my reassignment in the near future.
                    I also told him I would be a good soldier and go wherever he told me. I would
                    have been glad to go to the Senior Seminar and I would have been happy to stay
                    in the NSC.</p>
                <p>I found out later what the story was. Kissinger had promised Sadat at a dinner in
                    1976 when the King Tut exhibit opened in Washington at the National Gallery that
                    the PLO could open an office in Washington, in accordance with Sadat's request.
                    This was still in the period when the U.S. was not supposed to be conducting any
                    dialogue with the PLO. But Henry used Dean Brown - a retired ambassador - as an
                    intermediary. Dean arranged for things, but he never let it be known that he was
                    working on Kissinger's behalf. So the PLO was allowed to open an office in
                    Washington. Six weeks after that office opened, Israeli Ambassador Dinitz
                    lunched with Kissinger. After the lunch, Kissinger sent word out that the PLO
                    office was to be closed. He asked Roy Atherton to call Dean Brown and convey a
                    message to the PLO - only Dean knew where they could be found. Dean was followed
                    by INS people to the apartment where the PLO people were staying. As he left the
                    apartment house, Dean noticed some official looking men walking towards him.
                    They passed each other and later Dean found out to his great surprise and
                    chagrin that the INS people had given notice to the PLO people that they were to
                    leave the U.S. immediately. Dean and I discussed these events at a party hosted
                    by Charlie Yost which took place the next day. We commented that everyone was
                    apoplectic over this turn of events. I noted in the presence of the Egyptian
                    Ambassador that what his President was able to get at dinner, the Israelis were
                    able to undo at lunch. My comment was included in a report that the Egyptian
                    Ambassador sent to Cairo the next day, which somehow made its way to Kissinger.
                    There were some other remarks in that report which were quite unflattering and
                    were attributed to me when in fact most were made by Dean. It took six weeks to
                    turn Kissinger around; he felt that I had been very disrespectful of the
                    Secretary of State. Furthermore, one day Jeanne Davis, Executive Secretary of
                    the NSC, came to me and told me that I could continue to work at the NSC. The
                    whole six weeks were taken up by negotiations between Larry Eagleburger,
                    Kissinger's Under Secretary for Management, and Scowcroft about my future. In
                    retrospect, I find that whole episode amusing, but I can assure you that at the
                    time, I did not see any humorous aspect. This was a good example of Scowcroft's
                    character.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I might just continue with some comments about our relationship with the PLO
                    during the 1974-77 period. Kissinger and I had entirely different views on how
                    to deal with the PLO. He believed that they could never become participants in
                    the peace process; he thought that they would always play the “spoiler” role. My
                    view was that regardless of the PLO leadership and policies, no Arab state would
                    ever agree to any kind of settlement with Israel without PLO approval or at
                    least acquiescence. After all, the PLO was the organization - the only one -
                    that represented the Palestinian people. I felt therefore it could not be
                    ignored and would have to become involved eventually in the peace process, even
                    if the leadership and its policies might have to change. Kissinger felt that if
                    we were tough enough, we could bypass the PLO and still obtain Arab states'
                    approval of negotiated agreements with Israel. This was a continual debate and
                    difference between Kissinger and some of us.</p>
                <p>But Henry didn't close the door completely. There was one point in the 1975 Sinai
                    II talks when the Israelis tried to close the door completely by demanding that
                    there be absolutely no U.S. contacts with the PLO. Kissinger reformulated that
                    by saying that there would be no “negotiations” with the PLO, leaving himself
                    some “wiggle” room. But basically he felt that the PLO would not be a “player”.
                    He and I disagreed on that view. He always called me “the PLO representative”,
                    particularly after I chaired the administration's “PLO working group.” I want to
                    make it clear that I was not promoting Arafat nor the PLO policies which at the
                    time were not helpful to the peace process, but I did believe that the PLO had
                    so much political impact on Arab states as the essentially lone representatives
                    of the Palestinian people that ways had to be found to get the PLO engaged in
                    the peace process. I was not sure that the PLO would play, but I was certain
                    that we had to try to get them involved. Without them, I thought there was
                    little chance of success for peace in the Middle East. I wanted the U.S. to talk
                    to the Palestinians and to Arab governments on certain PLO policies which
                    clearly seemed to be impediments to the peace process. The PLO had to understand
                    that unless some of their policies were changed, they could not be “players”,
                    but if some changes were made, then the atmosphere might change and it might be
                    included in the peace process. That was the purpose of the “non-messages” that
                    were exchanged between Arafat and Kissinger in Rabat in 1974, with me and Walid
                    Khalidi, a Palestinian Professor and AUB [American University of Beirut] as the
                    messenger. They provided some hope and incentive to the PLO to be more
                    cooperative. In the late 1970s, it was clear to me that the PLO would have to
                    change its policies, and perhaps even its leadership, but that as an
                    organization representing the hopes and aspiration of the Palestinian people, it
                    had to be brought into the process.</p>
                <p>In my conversation with PLO members, I could not detect any concrete signs of
                    policy changes, but I was never ready to assume that the situation was hopeless.
                    At one stage, I actually was discouraged by the Israeli Political Counselor, who
                    invited me to lunch about two weeks after I had started my NSC assignment. He
                    said that it was too bad that I could not stay in the NSC much longer; when I
                    questioned this comment, he told me that since I was in contact with the PLO and
                    that was unacceptable to the Israelis.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>This suspicion apparently stemmed from my Beirut days; the Israeli were fully
                    aware of my contacts with the PLO then because every year I would travel to Tel
                    Aviv to brief my colleagues in the Embassy on my activities with the PLO
                    representative. I also briefed, in general terms, officials of the Israeli
                    Foreign Office; we discussed the general substance of my dialogue with the PLO
                    representatives - I did that on my own initiative because I thought it was the
                    proper thing to do; I was not under Washington instructions to give those
                    briefings, but I did it certainly with its knowledge. I didn't tell them of the
                    Arafat-Kissinger exchanges but I did tell the Israelis that I was having
                    discussions with the PLO. Never once, did they indicate then that they objected
                    to my conversations. They never tried to use me as an intermediary; they had
                    enough contacts of their own. It was only when I got to the NSC that they pulled
                    this history out.</p>
                <p>At the lunch, I told the Israeli diplomat that I had not had any contacts with
                    PLO representatives since Arafat had gone to the UN (in 1974). In any case, I
                    said that even if I had had contacts, I didn't understand why that was of such
                    great concern to the Israeli government. After all, the great majority of the
                    mayors of West Bank cities and towns were members of the PLO and they were in
                    constant contact with Israeli officials including Cabinet members. I found the
                    Israeli position somewhat contradictory in light of their own practices. In any
                    event, I stayed in the NSC, but I learned a further lesson about Israeli
                    “games”; I believe that they did try to have me reassigned from the NSC, but it
                    didn't work especially since their charges were just not true.</p>
                <p>My contacts with the PLO did resume to some extent during my NSC tour,
                    particularly after Sadat talked Kissinger into permitting the PLO to open an
                    office in Washington. I didn't have regular meetings with PLO people in the U.S.
                    but I did see them from time to time. When it was closed, my contacts
                    diminished. It was almost totally terminated after the second disengagement
                    agreement when we signed an understanding with Israel that there would be no
                    US-PLO “negotiations.” As I said, that was a reformulation of a “no contact”
                    phrase, but the U.S. decided that at least for a time, we would agree to a
                    strict “spirit” of the Israeli formulation. Kissinger emphasized the role of
                    Egypt; he did not believe, as I said earlier, that the PLO had any role in the
                    peace process. My successor in Beirut discontinued contacts with the PLO,
                    although one of the CIA agents in Beirut did pick up contact with another PLO
                    representative. So a contact was maintained, but in a more clandestine way.
                    Unfortunately, that CIA officer was killed when the Embassy was bombed; the PLO
                    representative was later assassinated by the Israelis. He was married to a
                    Lebanese woman, a former Miss Universe. The contacts with the PLO in Tunis did
                    not start until much later.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>While at the NSC, I did have meetings with foreign Embassy officials stationed in
                    Washington. I always briefed State officials on these meetings, most often with
                    “Memcoms.” This later became, in general, a questionable practice; it was a
                    sensitive subject to State when an NSC staffer held meetings with embassy
                    officials. The extent of State's acceptance of this practice depended on each
                    Secretary of State; some disliked it more than others. Shultz had different
                    views on this practice. At one time, he was apoplectic. Then he calmed down
                    somewhat. But the practice I think was always somewhat suspect from State's
                    point of view.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a little more about the peace process. I think everyone worked very
                    hard and effectively and I include our embassies overseas in that comment. I was
                    particularly impressed by the support we received from the CIA. Sam Hoskinson,
                    who had just moved into a new position oMiddle East National Intelligence
                    Officer, did a marvelous job of marshaling our intelligence resources to support
                    Kissinger's negotiations. The intelligence community built a replica of the Gidi
                    and Mitla passes in the Sinai for the 1975 negotiations - “Sinai II.” That was a
                    full scale model, very precise, which helped us to figure out what each side
                    really wanted, and where the different lines really were. We have taken the same
                    approach recently in Bosnia, although the job now is a lot easier in light of
                    all the satellite and computer capacities that we have. But in 1975, a model had
                    to be built so that we could see precisely what each side would have to do to
                    bring about a viable agreement. For example, the Israelis had agreed to abandon
                    territory which the Egyptians believed included the passes, but there was a lot
                    of flim-flam going on. The Israeli maps on closer examination showed that they
                    would not surrender the passes. So we had a precise topographical model built
                    which clearly showed that the passes would not be abandoned by the Israelis; in
                    fact, the lines on their maps would have left them right in the middle of the
                    passes.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>We had a similar experience with the oil fields in the Sinai. Kissinger, Sisco
                    and Saunders went to Aswan in the middle of the negotiations in the fall of
                    1975. The Israelis had promised direct Egyptian access to the oil fields in Abu
                    Rudeis. The proposal was to build two parallel roads - one Egyptian and one
                    Israeli. Roy and I were looking at maps prepared by the CIA. We noticed that at
                    high tide, the Egyptian road would be underwater. We didn't think that that
                    would be acceptable. So when Kissinger and the rest returned, we showed him the
                    maps and our conclusions. He went “up the wall” as he was known to do from time
                    to time. But he played his cards very skillfully. He waited until he had Rabin
                    and Allon - the two key Israeli Cabinet officers - together; he pulled out the
                    map and asked: “What are you guys doing? Is this some kind of Florida land deal?
                    I know that we Jews in the U.S. pull deals like this, but I didn't expect you
                    Israelis to do anything like that!” I think it was clear that the three Cabinet
                    officers didn't realize what they had suggested. The Israeli map had been drawn
                    up by their army. They excused themselves and went into the next room with the
                    Chief of Staff. There ensued a major argument. When they returned they explained
                    shame-facedly that there wasn't enough space to build two roads - the cliffs
                    came right up to the edge of the Red Sea. There was room for only one road.
                    Eventually all agreed that that one road would be used by each side on alternate
                    days. That was how that unique part of the agreement developed! It was very
                    interesting; it was only by sheer accident that Roy and I happened to look at
                    the Israeli maps which had only very faint lines representing the proposed roads
                    - drawn on them. I do believe that in this case, the Israeli civilian leadership
                    had been sabotaged by its military. I don't know what would have happened if the
                    roads had been built and then the Egyptians discovered that theirs was under
                    water for much of the time. At a minimum, it would have been embarrassing for
                    all concerned.</p>
                <p>CIA's model became very useful in determining precisely what each side had to do
                    to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. It was this kind of support from the
                    Agency which was so instrumental to the success of Kissinger's efforts. Another
                    matter was also indispensable. In 1970, we discovered that the Soviets and the
                    Egyptians had placed missiles along the Suez Canal-contrary to the “stand still”
                    cease fire agreement. That produced a major problem. I guess in 1976 we again
                    discovered that additional sites had been built, contrary to the agreement in
                    Sinai II. Sadat denied it. On our next trip to the region, we brought big maps
                    along with aerial photography of missile sites in the Soviet Union as well as
                    pictures of the holes in the Sinai, which were intended for missile launchers,
                    but at the time were still empty. Sadat insisted that what our photos showed
                    were underground hospital sites. So we showed him the Soviet sites with missiles
                    which were unmistakably similar to the Sinai holes, same angles, same size, same
                    everything. Only the missiles were missing. Kissinger told Sadat that he wanted
                    to congratulate the Egyptians for their parsimonious approach to construction of
                    their underground hospitals; they obviously had just taken the Soviet blueprints
                    for the building of a missile site and had used them - unchanged - for the
                    construction of underground hospitals! It must be so much cheaper. Two days
                    later, we noted from aerial photography that the missile sites holes were being
                    filled by bull-dozers; they disappeared. I think that was a neat feat!</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>My tasks in the development of the Sinai II agreement focused on the arrangements
                    that subsequently became the Sinai Support Mission. I worried about the
                    relationship between the UN efforts and our own on the demilitarization and
                    disarmament of certain areas of the Sinai. I worked a lot on that. It was
                    because of that assignment that Atherton and I discovered that the Egyptian road
                    would be under water, as I have described earlier. Of course, the staff worked
                    very collegially on all aspects of the Sinai II agreement; I happened to do much
                    of the work on the issues I have mentioned, although there was never any
                    official specific assignment of responsibilities among the team members. Various
                    staff members just undertook certain analyses as the need arose without any
                    specific assignments being made. For example, when the Israelis suggested that
                    the U.S. take responsibility for the policing of the demilitarized zone in the
                    Sinai, we refused. The Israelis didn't want the UN to have any role on that
                    particular issue - a theme that would be raised again at Camp David later on
                    which finally agreed on a multi-lateral police force which has no UN role in it
                    at all. For Sinai II, we finally agreed - to satisfy the Israelis without
                    eliminating the UN entirely - to have U.S. protection around the two
                    surveillance sites - one which the Israelis already had and the other that was
                    constructed for the Egyptians. We accepted the responsibility for providing
                    immediate security for those two sites, but beyond that tight perimeter,was the
                    demilitarized zone which became the responsibility of the UN. That was a
                    compromise to satisfy the Israeli demand for “no UN” participation and our own
                    policy which was to keep the UN involved in the Sinai - which we thought would
                    be helpful - as well as the Egyptian desire for some UN presence in the Sinai. I
                    believe that the peace process worked well. Kissinger prepared the ground very
                    carefully. He always had some specific objective in mind as he “shuttled.” He
                    was very focused on each trip on achieving some concrete results, but he was not
                    fixated by the process; he would not let matters drag on and on unresolved - as
                    we seem to be currently doing on the Israeli-Syria agreement. We are now
                    spending a lot of time working with Syria and Israel with not much to show for
                    our efforts. The “shuttle” was Kissinger's tool for conducting the peace
                    process; it is not one that everyone can use successfully. It requires very
                    careful preparation; it has to be clear on its major goals and they must be
                    signaled clearly in advance. It also requires continual attention and pressure -
                    as evidenced when Kissinger felt “deceived” by the Israelis, as I have described
                    earlier. He took firm action. When an agreement between Syria and Israel was
                    needed in early 1974, he stayed in the Middle East until he got some results.
                    Kissinger was always clear on his game plan and never hid his goals from his
                    negotiating partners - although not necessarily how he intended to achieve those
                    goals. And most of the time, he was successful. So the “shuttle” was a
                    diplomatic tool that Kissinger used effectively; it has no intrinsic value and
                    therefore is not necessarily a good tool for other policy makers. It happen to
                    fit the Middle East situation in the mid-1970s. “Shuttle” diplomacy needs the
                    right people and the right circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>On the negative side, it should be noted that obviously, the Jordanians got
                    short-changed; they had been promised a disengagement agreement with Israel, but
                    we didn't have the will or influence to bring it about. President Ford at that
                    stage did not have sufficient confidence in his own foreign policy competence
                    and probably did not have sufficient political support in the U.S. to tackle
                    that problem because it was just not an issue for King Hussein, but would have
                    required some accommodation on the part of the PLO. As we found out in 1974 at
                    the Rabat Summit, Arab public opinion did not view Hussein as the representative
                    of the Palestinians; that was, in their eyes, the role of the PLO. With the need
                    for some sort of PLO acquiescence and the certain Israeli hostility to such a
                    thing, it probably would have been a mistake for us to try to arrange for some
                    kind of agreement of Israel-Jordan., even though the King had been promised by
                    Kissinger and Nixon that we would try to work out something for Jordan and
                    Israel after the Egypt disengagement agreement. Syria had worked out one and we
                    had promised Hussein that he would be next. Syria got one because the oil rich
                    Arab states - mostly the Gulf ones - insisted on that.</p>
                <p>I found the Syria process an interesting one. I was still in Beirut when that was
                    worked out. In 1973, Kissinger announced from the White House that since the
                    disengagement agreement with Egypt had been signed, the Arab oil embargo against
                    the U.S. would then be lifted. But nothing happened. Sadat, in his memoirs, had
                    said that once his agreement with Israel was signed, he would go around the
                    Middle East and ask the Gulf states to lift the embargo. He recognized that the
                    lifting of the embargo was his responsibility. But he got nowhere. We couldn't
                    figure out why he had hit a brick wall. Then the Foreign Ministers of Saudi
                    Arabia, Kuwait and Algeria came to Washington and told Kissinger that before the
                    embargo could be completely lifted, the Syrians also needed a disengagement
                    agreement giving back to Syria some land lost in the 1967 war as had been done
                    for Egypt. That led to the thirty day shuttle which Kissinger could not abandon
                    since the oil embargo depended on it. King Faisal had told Nixon that he would
                    give us the benefit of the doubt and lift the embargo on the assumption that an
                    Syria-Israel disengagement agreement would be signed. That put Kissinger in a
                    “must complete” mode because had not some kind of Syria-Israel arrangement not
                    been achieved, the oil embargo might have been resumed. Kissinger performed
                    brilliantly, but it was under severe pressure; he had to stay in the area until
                    that agreement was reached. That doesn't come out very clearly in his memoirs,
                    but I remember that distinctly - the Saudi put a gun to our head, gave us some
                    time, but threatened us with the resumption of the embargo if no agreement was
                    reached. Nixon made it a priority and Kissinger delivered. As I said, I watched
                    this shuttle from Beirut; it was grueling, but absolutely essential to our
                    national security, as well as to getting the price of gasoline in the U.S.
                    down.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I mention this historical episode because it was the first time that we
                    understood the importance of Syria in Arab priorities. I think before that and
                    even later administrations have underestimated the importance of Syria. During
                    the Reagan administration, its first Middle East peace initiative omitted Syria.
                    It floundered. Jimmy Carter originally overlooked Syria and therefore got
                    nowhere. Syria plays a more central role than people have understood. Kissinger
                    later admitted that he had underestimated the importance of Syria. Thereafter,
                    whenever he went to the Middle East, even if it was not for negotiations, he
                    stopped in Damascus. I do believe that now Syria may not be as important as it
                    had been twenty years ago But in 1973, the Saudis made it eminently clear that
                    Syria was very important to them; they had to be protected from both Iran and
                    Syria. They were concerned by the threat that Syria posed not only militarily,
                    but through terrorist sponsorship and political subversion. After Sadat's
                    failure to have the embargo raised, Kissinger came to understand the importance
                    of Syria in the Middle East; it was a lesson that his successor either didn't
                    learn or only learned after having encountered failure.</p>
                <p>Assad is hard to deal with. He seems sort of isolated and one doesn't see Syria's
                    influence overtly. It is beneath the surface and therefore requires a very
                    careful examination of the Middle East terrain to notice it. Baker understood
                    Syria's importance almost immediately, primarily because Dennis Ross understood
                    it. Baker never made the mistake of underestimating Syria.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I might just make some comments about Kissinger and Israel. His relationship was
                    obviously quite intimate, but I don't think he behaved any differently in
                    Jerusalem than he did in Cairo. For example, during the Sinai II negotiations,
                    something very interesting happened. Kissinger was the one who in early 1975
                    recommended that the U.S. undertake a fundamental reassessment of its Middle
                    East policy because he felt that he and our new President, Gerald Ford, had been
                    deceived by Israel. They had promised to give up the Sinai oil fields and passes
                    during one of Israeli Foreign Minister Allon's meetings held in Washington in
                    January of that year. Kissinger then made a commitment to Sadat that the oil
                    fields and the passes would be returned to Egypt. But when Kissinger visited the
                    area in March, the Israelis said that they would surrender one or the other, but
                    not both. The Israelis would not move from that position, despite Allon's
                    promise. Sadat refused to accept the new Israeli position since he had been
                    promised otherwise. He insisted on having both the passes and the oil fields
                    returned. So Kissinger recommended that we distance ourselves from the Israelis
                    and the U.S. in fact suspended relationships with them - down to refusing the
                    Israeli Defense Attach� access to the Pentagon. The Israelis became very upset
                    because they had not completed their military modernization program to overcome
                    their 1973 losses. Congress was trying to limit the excesses of the Nixon
                    administration, to block Nixon's and Kissinger's propensity to pass out
                    assistance here and there according to their whims - sometimes well in advance
                    of Congressional authorization. It tightened security and military assistance
                    by, for example, denying the administration's ability to draw down resources in
                    advance of an approved appropriation bill. I doubt anyone thought that this
                    general provision would have, among its first “casualties”, assistance to Israel
                    - otherwise this provision might never have been enacted. But in 1975, this
                    requirement really put a stop to assistance to Israel, who were desperate to
                    finish the rebuilding of their military, but were stymied by this new
                    Congressional restriction.</p>
                <p>So we had both the slow-down of military assistance and the Kissinger-ordered
                    reassessment. The problems were exacerbated by the problems caused by a new 1975
                    Foreign Assistance Act which in a transition year, included authorization for
                    fifteen months - the beginning of the government's fiscal year shifted from July
                    1 to October 1. All these factors really put a squeeze on the Israelis,
                    accentuated by Ford and Scowcroft, acting without Kissinger's agreement - and to
                    his annoyance.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>When the 1975 Foreign Assistance Act first came to the President for approval,
                    Ford vetoed it. It contained some provisions which he felt encroached on his
                    prerogatives as President, such as requiring action by Congress in advance of
                    any military assistance project, beyond the statutory allocation of funds for
                    each recipient country. Also that legislation included $500 million for military
                    assistance for the Middle East to cover the extra fiscal quarter, but almost all
                    of it was reserved for assistance to Israel. Ford felt this was unfair,
                    especially since Israel had misled him on the Sinai process. That veto was based
                    essentially on the recommendation of Scowcroft and the White House staff. I
                    happened to be the note taker at a subsequent Oval Office meeting chaired by the
                    President and attended by Senators Humphrey and Javits and Kissinger and
                    Scowcroft. Humphrey wanted to know why Ford had vetoed the bill; he had checked
                    with Kissinger while the legislation was being discussed in a Senate-House
                    conference committee and Henry had indicated agreement with the draft
                    legislation. Ford turned to Humphrey and said: “Hubert, you don't seem to
                    understand; I am the President.” Kissinger turned purple; he looked at me as if
                    I were responsible for this fiasco - perhaps to some degree I was, but it was
                    Scowcroft who made the decision to recommend a veto. In any event, the delay in
                    passage of the legislation forced the Israelis to take up the administration's
                    cudgel; they were so desperate for additional military equipment that they went
                    and lobbied Humphrey and Javits to change the bill to ease its restrictive terms
                    and to allow more assistance to be provided to Arab states and other foreign aid
                    recipients.</p>
                <p>One day, early in the morning, Congressman Otto Passman, the chairman of the
                    Foreign Assistance Appropriations sub-committee entered Scowcroft's office. He
                    stayed all day; by the end of the day, they had agreed on a combined 1975-76
                    foreign assistance appropriations bill. That bypassed all the financial
                    restriction placed on the administration by the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. It was a very efficient way to solve at least part of the problem for
                    the Israelis.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I mention this episode because it was illustrative of how tough Kissinger could
                    be on the Israelis. There was another incident that makes the same point. After
                    the reassessment and the resolution of the assistance problems, the Israelis
                    came to Washington in the summer of 1975 and indicated a willingness to resume
                    negotiations - they were anxious for the assistance to flow again. As usual,
                    they came with a draft “Memorandum of Understanding” which they wanted to
                    negotiate. The draft included demands which we were supposed to agree to in
                    exchange for the resumption of negotiations. Kissinger authorized Sisco to
                    negotiate with the Israelis; that took about six weeks. Finally the “Memorandum”
                    was agreed upon - still in draft. In September, after the negotiations had gone
                    beyond “the point of no return”, it became clear to Kissinger that the Israelis
                    wanted to conclude the Sinai II agreement. For example the Israeli government
                    was using arguments in the Knesset for completing the agreement which we had
                    used earlier to try to convince it to conclude the agreement but which it had
                    rejected - i.e. why it should give up both the oil fields and the passes. The
                    Israeli government was in fact adopting our arguments and using them as their
                    own in the Knesset debates. At that stage, Kissinger thought that he could then
                    negotiate an Egypt-Israel agreement; he believed that a mutually acceptable
                    compromise could be reached that would cover the oil fields, the passes, the
                    demilitarized zones, the intelligence stations - one for Israel and one for
                    Egypt. We were in Jerusalem when the last hurdle was to be jumped, namely the
                    Israeli “Memorandum of Understanding.” That was the one that Sisco had
                    negotiated and which included the provision about “negotiations” with the PLO
                    that I discussed earlier. But when Kissinger focused on it, he noticed a number
                    of provisions which he found unacceptable because he felt that Congress would
                    balk at what appeared to him to be derogations of some Constitutional
                    authorities of the President. He thought therefore that the “Memorandum” as it
                    stood was totally unacceptable. Someone on the Israeli side reminded Kissinger
                    that he had not too much earlier already approved the draft. He raised his
                    eyebrows; he said: “I approved it? Does anyone see my name or initials on it?. I
                    only see Sisco's initials!” He was told that Sisco had said that he, Kissinger,
                    had approved it. “Did anyone here ever hear me say it was ok?”, Kissinger wanted
                    to know. And of course, none of us had. Even Sisco said that Kissinger had not
                    approved it. The latter denied ever having seen the draft before and certainly
                    had never approved it. It was hilarious!</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Then Kissinger began to take parts of the draft “MOU” [Memorandum of
                    Understanding] and cross them out. He realized that the process had gone too far
                    for anyone to back out; he understood he could afford to be quite cavalier about
                    the memorandum. We were astonished and aghast; we didn't understand what
                    Kissinger was up to. We had assumed that the U.S. would be stuck with the
                    memorandum that Sisco had negotiated; we understood that it was far too
                    restrictive; it would really reduce our negotiating flexibility, but we assumed
                    there was no way out. We all were certain Kissinger had told Sisco exactly what
                    to do. This was one time that Kissinger really surprised us; I certainly was and
                    I believe that all of the other members of the team were also. The way he
                    handled Sisco was absolutely brilliant; he in fact, left Joe holding the bag.
                    Joe was with us on this trip and I am sure he was flabbergasted, although he had
                    watched Kissinger take this approach with others; I am not sure that he ever
                    expected it to happen to him! What made the whole sequence of events even more
                    surprising was that a number of us had been telling Kissinger that the draft
                    memorandum was far too restrictive, but he didn't seem to have been listening to
                    us. But when the right time came - i.e. when the Israelis could not back out of
                    an agreement— he forced them to modify the “Memorandum of Understanding” to much
                    better suit the U.S. and give us greater flexibility in managing the peace
                    process.</p>
                <p>I think Kissinger treated Sadat and Rabin in about the same way. He was different
                    with Golda Maier. But with both Rabin and Sadat, he would spend hours explaining
                    the political situation, the psychological context, the personalities of the
                    leaders in Egypt to Rabin and vice versa to Sadat. I found those tours de force
                    very impressive. Rabin and Sadat wouldn't talk to each other; they had terrible
                    misconceptions about each other. He spent a lot of time explaining first to
                    Sadat and then to Rabin or vice-versa, what was doable in light of the domestic
                    problems that each faced. He played the role of a mentor; he would try to convey
                    a sense of reality to each side on what the other side was facing. It was an
                    impressive performance.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Kissinger had “pen pals” in other Arab capitals. During every negotiation, he
                    would periodically send reports to certain Arab leaders. In fact, my first
                    assignment was to draft messages to the “usuals” - Algeria, Syria, Jordan, etc.
                    - bringing them up to date on the Israeli-Egyptian agreement negotiations. He
                    was very careful about keeping Arab leaders informed. My first draft message to
                    the “pen pals” was in the usual State Department form; i.e. a circular telegram
                    to all of our ambassadors in the pertinent countries. I was severely chastised
                    by Kissinger because he told me that that was what he had done in the beginning
                    as well. But then he found out that his “pen pals” were checking with each
                    other; when they found out that they had all gotten the same message, they felt
                    upset. So he never sent circular reports again. He insisted that the first and
                    last paragraphs be different for each country. The rest could be the same in
                    substance, but with perhaps some different words. I learned then a lesson that I
                    never forgot. When I worked in the NSC the second time, I made sure that each
                    message looked different from any other, even if it were for such things as
                    National Days. The first paragraph always included a personal note from the
                    President of the U.S. to the recipient head of state or something special about
                    that particular individual and that country. After that, the text could deal
                    with more general issues, but that first paragraph was key to making the whole
                    message personal and therefore more likely to be read and absorbed by the
                    recipient. The final paragraph would then refer to a specific issue, again
                    singular to the relationship between the U.S. and the recipient. I found that we
                    could do this even with National Day messages. If we hadn't done it that way, we
                    would have lost a lot of good opportunities because a “standard” message just
                    would not get the same attention as one which seemed to be so personal. This
                    process took more time than the standard message would have, but it also had a
                    much greater impact when personalized.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the peace process, I might just mention what we did in preparation
                    for each trip. We first reviewed all of the outstanding issues that were to be
                    discussed and wrote up background papers on each. Then we would collect
                    biographic data on all of the people that Kissinger would meet. These papers
                    would serve as the backbone of a large briefing book. Then we would identify the
                    options available to us on each of the issues. Usually, these papers were
                    prepared by Hal Saunders, myself and our staffs. This was a pattern that I found
                    Hal had established when I joined the Policy Planning Staff; it was continued
                    essentially in the same mode throughout the Kissinger years. By 1974, the
                    process was a lot smoother because the separation between the Secretary of State
                    and the NSC Advisor had been essentially obliterated. No longer was the NSC
                    staff forbidden to share information with the State Department, as had been true
                    in Hal Saunders' days. That system of compartmentalization changed after the
                    1973 war during which Kissinger discovered that the Foreign Service could be
                    very helpful to him and did not “leak” to the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>During 1976 - an election year - the “shuttles” were suspended. We did continue
                    to work - at long distance - on improving the Middle East situation. We
                    concentrated on seeing what could be done on Syria-Israel and Jordan-Israel
                    relations; those had essentially been neglected in the peace process to date.
                    President Ford was keenly aware of this factor, which I found very interesting.
                    He thought that Syria and Jordan had been “jilted” somehow and wanted them to
                    get some special attention. But because of the elections, we could not really
                    continue to be so heavily engaged at the top in the peace process. Most of the
                    work in 1976 was done by the NEA Bureau and the NSC staff.</p>
                <p>The President did decide to let Syria Airways and Jordanian Airways fly to the
                    United States. In this case, he over-ruled the CAB which for commercial reason
                    wanted to restrict access to U.S. airports. Ford took that action primarily
                    because he did not feel that either Syria or Jordan had been treated as well as
                    Egypt and Israel in the peace process. It was his way to try to maintain good
                    relations with Damascus and Amman and perhaps even improve them. The Jordanians
                    used this approval to extend their fleet; with the assistance of the UAE, they
                    bought two new Boeing 747's and started a Jordan-U.S. air service. The Syrians
                    never did fly - for ideological reasons.</p>
                <p>I think we got good support from our embassies in the region during the
                    “shuttles”. I think they were probably not very happy with the Kissinger style
                    of diplomacy. They didn't have as much input into the process as they
                    undoubtedly would have liked. The “shuttle” work was done almost all by
                    Kissinger and his entourage; there wasn't much time to consult embassies. But
                    they gave us all the support we required, even if they felt a little left
                    out.</p>
                <p>I should make one other point about the “shuttle” which I found fascinating. The
                    press corps that traveled with Kissinger was very aggressive, particularly in
                    Cairo where I think they might even be described as obstreperous. For some
                    reason, they felt free to take liberties with Sadat. It was also fairly
                    aggressive in Israel, less so in Jordan. There was one place where it was very
                    meek - never asking a question out of turn, responding only when called upon -
                    it was Saudi Arabia. King Faisal had such a majestic presence that the American
                    press corps was cowed! I will never forget that; it was fascinating to
                    watch.</p>
                <p>The press did not bother us too much on the “shuttle.” It knew that we would not
                    say much. Kissinger would frequently hold press “tutorials” as well as informal
                    conferences on the plane; it was all on background attributed to “a high ranking
                    official.” But the press learned early on that the staff would not be very
                    responsive and therefore never really got in our way.</p>
                <p>During these “shuttles”, I, of course, met a number of very interesting
                    personalities. In no particular order, let me start with Rabin. There was a
                    foreign leader who understood Americans very well. Even then, he took a
                    collegial approach in his decision making. He and Perez and Allon - the main
                    Israeli negotiators—-had the final say, and worked off the same sheet of
                    music.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Sadat obviously was a man prepared to take some political risks. On the other
                    hand, he wanted assurances from us that his willingness to take such risks would
                    have some visible results. He was bright, inquisitive, personable. One
                    outstanding feature of his leadership was his almost instinctive reaction to
                    members of Congress; it didn't take him long to understand that they had to be
                    cultivated; he did that superbly.</p>
                <p>Assad was obviously the sole man in charge in Damascus. I was impressed, as was
                    Kissinger, by Assad's breath of knowledge. At one time in 1974, when we were
                    talking about a variety of issues unrelated to the peace process, Assad
                    proceeded to deliver an analysis of what he thought was going on in South
                    Vietnam. He was very accurate in his description of domestic politics in that
                    country. Kissinger was quite surprised. They also talked about the situation in
                    the Gulf, in Somalia and other parts of the world. Assad not only had obviously
                    detailed knowledge of situations in many parts of the world, but his analytical
                    skills were remarkable; he understood what was going on in many places outside
                    the Middle East. He knew much more of the world than some people have given him
                    credit for. As I said, there was never any doubt in our mind that Assad was very
                    much in charge of Syria and had always been so. I think as long as he lives,
                    that will always be the situation. He was quite ill for several months and
                    perhaps then some power was shared, but he recovered and is again the sole
                    master of his country.</p>
                <p>We saw King Hussein several times. He was very hospitable. He seemed frequently
                    disappointed in the U.S. because he never got as much as he was led to believe
                    or perhaps expected - i.e. interim agreement with Israel, military equipment,
                    etc. Hussein seemed to me always to be expecting more than he ever got.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the Middle East, I might just comment on our general objectives in
                    the area. One goal clearly was to reduce Soviet influence there. I have already
                    discussed some of the tactics that Kissinger used to achieve this goal. He made
                    it quite clear that the U.S. could deliver material and political support to
                    both the Arabs and the Israelis - something the Soviets could not. That made the
                    U.S. indispensable in the Middle East. I had to smile when I recently read that
                    Christopher had been kept waiting by Assad who was seeing the Russian Foreign
                    Minister. On one of the Syrian “shuttles”, Kissinger and Assad were at the
                    Damascus airport discussing some matters. Assad deliberatively kept the
                    conversation going because he knew that Gromyko was circling overhead waiting
                    for landing clearance which was not to be given until Kissinger had taken off.
                    That was Assad's way of signaling who was important to him at that time. As I
                    said, one of our top national priorities was to keep the Soviets out of the
                    Middle East - it was true in the 1970s until the end of the 1980s. At the time,
                    I thought it was the right policy because I had no reason to dispute the U.S.
                    assessment of Soviet expansionist desires. I did have some qualms about the
                    extent of our efforts; I thought it was a little overdone. Sometimes, that
                    overriding objective pushed us into positions in the Middle East that we might
                    not have needed to be in. But in general, I had no argument with our major
                    policy thrust.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>There was a considerable change in direction during the Carter administration.
                    Carter's whole approach was much more open; he made an effort to cooperate with
                    the Soviets not only in the Middle East, but globally. Kissinger had given the
                    Soviets a role in the Middle East - in form, but not in substance. I think
                    Carter's approach was useful; it permitted further progress in the peace process
                    leading eventually to Camp David. I believe that Carter was prepared to allow
                    the Soviets greater influence on Middle East affairs, but for one reason or
                    another, it never really occurred. I don't believe that Carter's change of
                    emphasis on the role of the Soviets in the final analysis had much long term
                    impact on the peace process because the U.S. was and is still the principal
                    player in the area. The Carter administration did develop some initiatives soon
                    after taking office which were not successful.</p>
                <p>During my first tour in the NSC, we had other matters on our plate besides the
                    Middle East. For example, the government in Kabul was very close to Moscow. We
                    felt that it was trying to subvert Pakistan and maybe even trying to annex parts
                    of Pakistan - Baluchistan, and the Frontier provinces. These territories were
                    almost like the Wild West. No central government had much authority in these
                    provinces; they ran themselves as they saw fit. The Soviets were working hand in
                    glove with the Afghan government against the Pakistanis, who were considered our
                    friends and allies even at that time. Kissinger began to work with the Shah and
                    Bhutto; we discussed these issues on some of our 1974 and 1975 trips that took
                    us, as I mentioned earlier, to Teheran and Islamabad. The Iranians offered
                    material help; we used diplomacy and the Pakistani pressured Afghan President
                    Daoud through recruited Afghans who conducted guerrilla warfare against his
                    government. That was in part a payback for what the Afghanis were doing in some
                    of the Pakistani provinces. Later, in 1976, we continued these discussions with
                    the leaders of Iran and Pakistan via messages through our ambassadors there; the
                    question was how Iran and Pakistan working together could effect a change of
                    Afghan foreign policy away from the Soviet Union and towards us and our allies.
                    We did stop to talk to Daoud in Kabul, in 1976, and began to turn him around and
                    away from Moscow and towards Iran, Pakistan and us. Relations between
                    Afghanistan and Pakistan became normal in 1977-78. The Afghan-Soviet efforts to
                    subvert Pakistan stopped. As we later discovered, we succeeded all too well. The
                    Shah's efforts and assistance worked so well that the Afghan Communist Party,
                    with the help of the Soviets, felt compelled to overthrow Daoud. That led to the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. So our successful efforts to change Afghan
                    foreign policy resulted in a coup and a Soviet invasion! Daoud's turning away
                    from Moscow and from the Afghan Communist Party and his establishment of good
                    ties with Pakistan and Iran and the U.S. gave cause for great anxiety in
                    Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The Soviets then decided that Daoud had to be removed. It is not entirely clear
                    to me even today how much of an active role the Soviets played in the coup
                    against Daoud. But it is quite clear that their distaste for events in Kabul
                    initiated a chain of events that eventually brought the Soviet Army into
                    Afghanistan. This is an illustration of “unintended consequences.” Kissinger
                    wanted to move Afghanistan out of the Soviet orbit; he certainly succeeded in
                    his goal, but with longer range consequences that were not anticipated. We
                    probably were too active in Afghanistan; we didn't understand adequately the
                    Afghan domestic political reverberation of using Pakistan to reach our goals. As
                    I said, both Afghan Communist parties became very suspicious of Pakistan's
                    involvement and mounted a coup to overthrow Daoud. When the Communists ran into
                    trouble in governing Afghanistan, the Soviets had to come in to help them. That
                    took place during the Carter administration, but I think can be directly tied to
                    Kissinger's efforts to eliminate or at least greatly diminish the Soviet
                    influence in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>In the period 1974-1977, the relationship between Pakistan and India was not bad.
                    After the Simla agreement in 1972, the situation calmed down and a period of
                    relative stability ensued. There was not a great deal of animosity or tension
                    between the two countries. This calm actually covered all of South Asia - as in
                    “calm after the storm.” I don't believe that we could say that the U.S. had a
                    definitive “tilt” towards Pakistan. India had beaten up Pakistan quite badly in
                    1971 and enabled East Pakistan to secede. We were still very friendly with the
                    Pakistanis, but since they had lost half of their country only a couple of years
                    earlier, they were not very confident or strong. That made their concerns for
                    Afghan subversion even more acute; they had some suspicion that the Indians were
                    in league with the Afghans, but there was never any hard evidence of that. As I
                    said, relations between Pakistan and India in this three year period were
                    relatively tranquil. The provinces bordering India and Kashmir were quiet; the
                    troubles were all in the north and north-west. I think our South Asia policy at
                    the time was correct. I had no trouble with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I might just mention one incident that occurred in Lahore in 1976. Kissinger, as
                    usual, was in the process of delivering some brilliant after-dinner comments. He
                    began them, as he often did, by denigrating his staff, telling one and all that
                    he had made up his remarks because had he left that task to the staff it would
                    have made a mess of it. This often public abuse of the staff - even if perceived
                    as “humor” - was not greatly appreciated by the staff. But that was his style.
                    In fact, on this particular occasion, he had been unhappy with the several
                    drafts that had been provided to him. He wanted an extraordinary speech because
                    he knew that Bhutto was a superb after-dinner speaker and of course Kissinger
                    did not want to be outshone. In any case. I thought that Kissinger's remarks
                    were brilliant. Then Bhutto spoke, was even more brilliant and won the speech
                    contest without a doubt. I was sitting at a table with a Pakistani diplomat; I
                    told him that we would certainly be in for a lecture because although we had
                    worked on Kissinger's comments for three weeks - and Kissinger had himself spent
                    time on them - it was obvious to me that Bhutto made the better speech that
                    night. The diplomat then told me that they had been working on Bhutto's speech
                    for three months; he knew that because he had been part of the speech writing
                    team. Small world! As I expected, Kissinger was apoplectic after the dinner. He
                    gave us hell for not having produced a better text; he agreed that Bhutto was
                    the cleverer orator that night.</p>
                <p>We spent considerable time in the 1974-77 period working on India and Pakistan
                    issues even though there was relative calm between the two countries. By 1974,
                    the countries in South East Asia had pretty well decided they could manage
                    affairs quite well by themselves. There was an agreement - implicit at least -
                    on the part of the Soviets, Chinese and ourselves that we would refrain from
                    involvement in the area. That worked out quite well. There were some questions
                    about non-proliferation, but in general we and the other major powers were
                    content to let matters on the sub-continent move without outside interference.
                    Between 1971 and 1989 the situation in South Asia was relatively stable and
                    quite acceptable to us.</p>
                <p>Let me briefly turn to Lebanon, my old stomping grounds. While I was working at
                    the NSC, Ambassador Meloy was assassinated in Beirut. I knew Frank fairly well;
                    I briefed him several times before he went out on his assignment. So his murder
                    was personally shocking. I was also somewhat incredulous that we had allowed
                    that to happen. Where was his security both by the Embassy staff and the
                    Lebanese government troops? No one was surprised by the unrest and civil war in
                    Lebanon; I think all observers saw it coming. I don't think we could have
                    prevented it; the best we could do was to work with the Syrians in an effort to
                    contain the violence. The Syrians at the time supported the Maronites and other
                    Christian factions against the PLO. We didn't have any great interest in
                    becoming the peace maker in Lebanon; I don't think we could have anyway, without
                    a massive intervention effort that no one was really interested in making.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I mentioned military assistance earlier during our discussion of Israel. Part of
                    the responsibility of an NSC staffer was to review the assistance budget
                    submission of the Department and AID. The NSC staff had a division which focused
                    entirely on assistance, but all of us with regional responsibilities
                    participated as well. For example, we advised Scowcroft that we thought that the
                    1975-76 assistance allocation as proposed by the Department was totally out of
                    whack. As I mentioned earlier, the fifth quarter's resources were to be devoted
                    almost entirely to Israel; there were no funds for assistance to Arab states.
                    That was just illogical and very poor policy. That was the issue on which
                    Scowcroft held a position opposed to Kissinger's - much to the surprise of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>I think we used military assistance in the same way the Soviets did - as a tool
                    of diplomacy to bring governments closer to us. In some cases, it served as a
                    deterrent against aggression against the recipient country. It also promoted
                    cooperation between military establishments and sent a political message as
                    well. So we did use military assistance for political purposes as well as for
                    strengthening the recipient military establishments. There were instances in
                    which I was concerned by the proliferation of weapons in certain countries -
                    i.e. Lebanon. That was not due to any military assistance, but just to the wide
                    availability of affordable weapons that all factions acquired. I expressed my
                    concern to the Lebanese, but they didn't share my worries; they were content to
                    let the weapons flow. We on the NSC staff were concerned about the quantity and
                    quality of arms made available to Iran. This again was not primarily an
                    assistance issue since the Iranians bought the weapons with their own resources,
                    but nevertheless we did have questions about the amount and level of
                    sophistication of the Shah's apparent appetite for weapons. We discussed this
                    issue with Scowcroft, but ours was a minority view. We thought that we might be
                    giving Iran too much and too sophisticated. But Kissinger had set the policy and
                    that was the end of any debate.</p>
                <p>There were some Arab countries, like Jordan, that felt they deserved a greater
                    share of the military assistance pie. But in fact, we had some concern about the
                    levels that we were already providing to countries like Egypt - both on military
                    and economic assistance. We took a major role in Egypt, giving us a very high
                    profile. We on the staff thought that there was a possibility that such
                    visibility might come to haunt us someday. In Egypt, we had some doubts about
                    its absorptive capacity and our high level of assistance gave us an expanded
                    role in Egyptian affairs which made us a prominent target for
                    dissatisfaction.</p>
                <p>In regard to arms to and iSouth Asia, we commissioned the CIA to undertake a
                    study of the Pakistan-India military balance which was updated quarterly. That
                    was an excellent study which proved quite useful in discussion with Congress in
                    support of our military assistance budgetary requests. I do believe that areas
                    which have some balance in their military capabilities tend to have stability; a
                    preponderance of military power in the hands of one party is often an invitation
                    for mischief by the other. The aggressor needs to know that he will have to pay
                    a price for his policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>All the senior NSC staff members had contacts with foreign diplomats. That was
                    not an issue between us and the State Department. We did not try to make policy
                    behind anyone's back. In the Middle East area, our relationships with NEA could
                    not have been better. Despite some comments to the contrary, I did not find NEA
                    to have a pro-Arab “tilt”. I think that almost all contacts were initiated by
                    the foreign diplomats. It was the embassies that contacted us just in hopes of
                    finding what was going on, perhaps on matters that they had not discussed with
                    the Department or checking on what they had been told by the Department. Our
                    coordination with NEA was so close that these contacts with foreign diplomats
                    did not create any problems.</p>
                <p>There is of course a difference in perception of situations when you sit in the
                    NSC as contrasted to the State Department. The view from the NSC is much
                    broader. You also get a much better understanding in the NSC of how different
                    policies relate to each other not only within a region, but also between
                    regions. Sometimes an NSC staffer might not have all the details, but I have
                    also found that knowing a lot of details may hamper policy development rather
                    than help it. The view from 1600 Pennsylvania is entirely different than it is
                    from Foggy Bottom.</p>
                <p>Before finishing the discussion of my 1974-77 tour in the NSC, I might just
                    comment on another Kissinger innovation: the Annual Reports. I think they were
                    very useful not only as tools to explain our policies to the public, but they
                    also provided guidance to the Executive departments. They have now fallen out of
                    favor, except at the Pentagon which still does country and regional analysis.
                    But I thought the Annual Reports were useful. During my stint at the NSC Peter
                    Rodman was the chief editor. The first draft would usually come from the NSC
                    staff. We would send it to the departments for comment. We would then amend the
                    first drafts and send them on to Rodman. Even after Kissinger became Secretary
                    of State and Scowcroft was the NSC Advisor, those Reports were useful policy
                    tools. After Kissinger became Secretary, he had the regional bureaus prepare
                    their own reports; the NSC Reports continued to be published. In some
                    situations, the drafting of the Reports raised some issues which had not been
                    discussed before - or at least adequately. That was another benefit of the
                    Reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1977, you were assigned to the Bureau of East Asian
                        Affairs.How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Dick Holbrooke, the new Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, was
                    looking for a new staff for the Bureau. He was not too pleased with what he had
                    inherited. I had known Dick in Saigon and later in Paris, where he was a member
                    of the U.S. delegation to the Vietnam peace talks. We were good friends and I
                    guess Dick thought I could help him. I told him that I was not an Asian expert.
                    He said that he was not looking for an expert, he wanted someone who could work
                    with him well. In fact, Dick pulled together a top notch staff. He had Bill
                    Gleysteen as his senior deputy who handled northeast Asia - Japan, Korea and
                    China. He hired Erland Heginbotham to be his deputy for economic affairs - a
                    superb officer. I handled southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Dick also changed almost all of the office directors. He was criticized for all
                    those personnel moves, as he was later when he became Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs. What he did was to put in place officers who gave him a very
                    high quality product. He himself was absolutely frenetic, but very effective as
                    long as his deputies kept him in touch with the rest of the Department and the
                    real world - and vice-versa. Dick was constantly in motion, often on the Seventh
                    Floor in Vance's office - not in Christopher's. He would be often at the White
                    House, in Congress, with Bob Strauss - the Special Trade Representative, with
                    Mike Blumenthal - the Secretary of the Treasury. Dick was constantly pushing to
                    have an impact on policy; that was his forte because he is able to see the
                    broader picture. He was not afraid to take a position, but he always tried to
                    see how that particular issue fitted into a much larger framework. He wanted to
                    be a major player in the painting of the broad policy canvas.</p>
                <p>He expected his deputies to handle the day-to-day routine matters and to keep him
                    informed about events in the Far East. He wanted to make sure that he and his
                    staff were in full sync, but he gave his deputies wide latitude for action. In
                    my view, Dick had sound judgement. He was not as prolific in throwing out new
                    ideas as Shriver, for example, had been in Paris. But Dick had plenty of ideas
                    and most of them were quite sound. He would pursue them systematically; he was
                    not the kind who had an idea today and tomorrow would be off in a different
                    direction. When he had a thought, he pursued it diligently. He would listen to
                    the thoughts of his deputies and his staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I was responsible for ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries,
                    Indochina, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands. These latter three
                    areas were transferred to Evelyn Colbert when she joined FE as another deputy to
                    Dick. In 1977, ASEAN was pretty much defunct. Dick thought that we should try to
                    reactive and rejuvenate that organization as a means to invigorate and improve
                    our relationships with the non-communist countries of southeast Asia; I fully
                    agreed with that concept. With the end of the Vietnam war, we had left the
                    impression that we had no further interest in that part of the world, leaving
                    these non-communist countries to believe that they had to fend for themselves.
                    We concluded that we could not establish closer rapport with those countries
                    through any kind of security arrangements because the Congress and the American
                    body politic would not have supported any further U.S. security initiative in
                    southeast Asia; most likely, those countries were also not prepared to have any
                    security ties to the U.S. since they felt that we had let them down. So we
                    decided to focus on economic issues, realizing that advances on that front would
                    also be beneficial to the political relationships among the ASEAN countries and
                    between them and the US. Dick had the brilliant idea of getting Japan to be a
                    co-sponsor of an effort to rejuvenate the ASEAN organization - to give those
                    countries greater vitality and to bring them closer to the US. Phil Habib, the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs, was very skeptical; he didn't believe
                    that ASEAN would ever develop into an effective organization - after all, we had
                    tried that approach in the past without any success. Dick Holbrooke would not be
                    deterred; he went directly to the Japanese Embassy in Washington and submitted
                    his idea. When the Japanese Prime Minister came on a visit to see President
                    Carter in the Spring of 1977, he made the proposal that Japan and the U.S. work
                    together to reactivate ASEAN. Carter thought it was a wonderful idea; so Dick's
                    thought came to be U.S. policy through a White House directive that the
                    “Japanese Prime Minister's idea” be given full consideration. Habib, who knew
                    Holbrooke well, probably had a pretty good idea where the “Japanese idea”
                    stemmed from. He was still skeptical.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>In fact, Dick's idea turned out to be very valuable. To me it became another
                    illustration of Dick's steadfastness and his willingness to pursue goals even
                    over a long period of time. We started to work with the ASEAN countries in 1977
                    by suggesting that they begin to develop a common view on tariffs. There had
                    been a lot of discussions about commodity prices and “most favored nations”
                    status. We asked those countries to develop common positions on all of these
                    various economic issues. They were considering allocating various industries to
                    each country; we did not believe that to be a sound economic rationale. But we
                    did believe that some progress might be made on commodity prices and tariffs if
                    ASEAN could take a common position on those issues. That idea led to frequent
                    discussions between ASEAN, Japan and the U.S. in late 1970s. These efforts led
                    to joint investments and other economic endeavors. In the process, the ASEAN
                    countries decided to have annual meetings; they invited the U.S. and Japan to
                    have their Foreign Ministers attend the first one as observers. That started a
                    “dialogue” which took place after the official ASEAN session was concluded.
                    Later, Australia and New Zealand were added as observers, followed by Canada and
                    the European Union. More recently, China and the Soviet Union have been invited
                    and finally, Vietnam has actually joined ASEAN. We now have the ironic situation
                    where an organization - ASEAN - originally established as a bulwark against
                    Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union - embraces all of its former adversaries and
                    meets with them regularly every year. This is particularly notable since our
                    withdrawal from Vietnam left a power vacuum in the region for several years.
                    ASEAN now talks regularly about economic problems, but common security issues
                    are not neglected. One of the early consequences of this rejuvenation was that
                    Malaysia and Singapore abandoned their support for Muslim dissidents in the
                    Phillippines. There has been a marked decrease of frictions among the ASEAN
                    states; they became much more allied and understanding of each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>It has to be recognized that the ASEAN countries had only geographical proximity
                    to tie them together. Culturally, they are quite disparate. They all had very
                    active ethnic Chinese minorities, who were major players in the business
                    communities. The ASEAN countries were also quite concerned about their communist
                    neighbors. Otherwise, they were quite disparate, had many suspicions and
                    divisions accompanied at times by low level subversive activities against each
                    other. I think they decided to pull together after the U.S. defeat in Vietnam
                    because they began to realize how dangerous division was; they were afraid of
                    the Vietnamese, the Soviets and the Chinese. In the 1970s, the Chinese were
                    actively supporting communist parties in each of the ASEAN countries; these
                    organizations were engaged in all sorts of subversive activities. That made the
                    ASEAN countries quite concerned about their security. The governments in power
                    had been identified with the US; we really left them in a lurch when we withdrew
                    militarily from the region. Our withdrawal, accompanied by their perception of
                    our disinterest in the regions, left the ASEAN countries in a quandary - what
                    would they do now to defend themselves. The Japan-U.S. proposal to revitalize
                    ASEAN came as a very welcome proposal not only to begin to address the security
                    concerns, but also to increase Japanese investment and assistance for their
                    countries. They undoubtedly also hoped for greater U.S. investment, if not
                    assistance. They saw ASEAN as a means to raise their economic standards. As time
                    went along, they realized that they were making economic progress as a group -
                    probably more than they would have done if they had been working independently.
                    They found that their leverage on such economic issues as commodity prices was
                    much greater as a group than it would have been as individual countries. In
                    fact, the results of the various meetings on economic issues were helpful to all
                    of them because they were all producers of tropical products; they soon
                    recognized the power of block voting as contrasted to individual country
                    votes.</p>
                <p>We had to be low key in our participation. The effort to revitalize ASEAN was
                    intended to foster the influence of the southeast nations, not for the U.S. to
                    tell them what to do. As I said, most of the countries did very well with their
                    economic development; the Phillippines were the outstanding exception - it did
                    not do as well as the others. It had great internal problems with Marcos as
                    President. It has now just begun to revive with its economic growth beginning to
                    match those of the other ASEAN countries. The other countries did very well in
                    their economic development; they realized the importance of the private sector
                    and encouraged investments.</p>
                <p>I attended all of the ASEAN Ministerial meetings while working in EA. Secretary
                    Vance and Holbrooke attended as well. They were fascinating. The attendees would
                    get up and sing and dance; they were very relaxed and increasingly confident of
                    the viability of their alliance. For example when the Vietnamese invaded
                    Cambodia in late 1978, ASEAN was strong enough and cohesive enough that the
                    Thais were able to stand the shock. The Thai government did not collapse; it did
                    not change its foreign policy direction and try to win favor with the
                    Vietnamese. On the other hand, they were sensible enough not to get involved in
                    combat against the Vietnamese.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Also the economic success of ASEAN was visible to all. Thailand, for example, in
                    the early to mid 1970s had a lot of internal problems - a lot of students left
                    the campuses to join the communists and other anti-government groups in the
                    jungles. By the late 1970s, the Thai economic policies had so improved the
                    standard of living and its pacification program had been so successful that a
                    lot of the students left their hide-outs and returned to the universities. They
                    didn't like the jungle living and found that living in cities and towns had
                    greatly improved. At the same time, the Chinese dropped their support of the
                    communist parties in all of the ASEAN countries. They began to cooperate as much
                    as they could with the governments. That made a large difference; the steam went
                    out of the subversion. The Chinese realized that they would not in the long run
                    win with subversion of the ASEAN governments and would lose any possibility of
                    economic relationships with those countries. I think that the change in Chinese
                    policy is further evidence of the wisdom of the revitalization of ASEAN and of
                    the U.S. pursuit of that goal. I think that the U.S. role in this ASEAN effort
                    was probably not fully recognized or appreciated outside the State Department.
                    Southeast Asia was not high on the President's foreign policy agenda.</p>
                <p>We did have a small but intense bureaucratic battle with PM - Les Gelb - and the
                    NSC on the question of the neutrality of the Indian Ocean. The Australian
                    Ambassador called to our attention discussions that the U.S. had on going with
                    the Soviets. He thought, from his point of view that something was amiss. That
                    caused Holbrooke to look into what was going on. He was finally able to get PM
                    and the NSC to share with him what the conversations with the USSR had been all
                    about. We found out to our horror that the total preoccupation of the U.S.
                    government in these talks had been with the northeast quadrant of the Indian
                    Ocean - around the Persian Gulf. In the process we had neglected the interests
                    of our allies in the rest of the Indian Ocean. The map that Gelb, as the U.S.
                    representative to the US-USSR discussions, had tentatively agreed on included
                    our bases in Australia - both intelligence and military, ports and airfields -
                    which meant that they would have been included in the demilitarized areas of the
                    Indian Ocean. We would have had to close those facilities. EA had no knowledge
                    of what the NSC was doing; the talks were very closely held and only Gelb really
                    knew what was going on. The Soviets were close to having pulled a fast one, but
                    fortunately the Australian Ambassador was alert enough to warn us of what was
                    going on. I think the NSC and Gelb just didn't pay enough attention to the map
                    and the details as it concerned those areas which were not seen as being of
                    principal importance to them at the time. The U.S. team working with the Soviets
                    just didn't have any clue about our assets in Australia and their importance to
                    our national security. They were preoccupied with the Gulf. The intelligence
                    station in Australia at the time was the only facility that could pick up
                    satellite signals without their being detected and read by anyone else.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>One of my main preoccupations was the ASEAN refugee problem. We took the lead and
                    worked with former Senator Dick Clark, the Special Coordinator for Refugee
                    Affairs. Dick Holbrooke recognized the importance of this issue and told me to
                    go to work on it. I worked with some very good people. The major part of the
                    problem stemmed from the large numbers of refugees who had fled and were fleeing
                    Vietnam and other parts of Indochina after our withdrawal. Many of these people
                    had associated with us during the war; there were also many ethnic Chinese. They
                    came out in droves, starting as I said, after our withdrawal from Vietnam and
                    reaching a crescendo in 1977-78. Our bureau took the initiative in trying to
                    organize a world-wide response; the U.S. agreed to take more, but we also put a
                    lot of pressure on Western Europe, Canada, Australia to resettle more of these
                    refugees in their countries. We also pressured the ASEAN countries to establish
                    holding camps where the refugees could seek temporary shelter while permanent
                    settlement places were being found. There was initial ASEAN reluctance, but
                    eventually the southeast countries cooperated. In 1977, during my first trip to
                    Thailand and Malaysia, I personally stopped officials who were trying to shove
                    the boats back out to sea. They didn't want to provide even temporary shelter
                    because, they said, they were culturally different from the refugees. They were
                    concerned that the refugees would become permanent settlers. At the time, we
                    didn't have a policy on this problem, but soon thereafter we developed a
                    world-wide policy working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Our
                    efforts were primarily humanitarian; we believed that we owed these Vietnamese
                    refugees some assistance because of our involvement in the war. The Carter
                    administration had a keen social conscience, as did Dick Holbrooke. There were
                    very few if any political benefits because the ASEAN countries and some of the
                    others went along with our policy very reluctantly. They did not find providing
                    refuge a natural part of their culture. I think in the final analysis our
                    refugee policy was wiser than we had anticipated because over the long run it
                    has helped Canada and Australia - changed their total approach to immigration.
                    Australia now considers itself to be an Asian country; in 1977 it looked at
                    itself as a bastion of Western Europe in Asia and was strongly opposed to any
                    immigration. Our policy has increased tolerance in the area; it has made these
                    countries feel better about themselves. It has probably also assisted the
                    improvement of relationships between Vietnam and its neighbors in the long
                    run.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I found the whole refugee process very interesting. I remember flying from
                    Bangkok to Geneva in 1977 for the first UNHCR meeting on Vietnamese refugees.
                    There we started the pledge process - how many refugees each country would take
                    for permanent resettlement. Those pledges in turn convinced the southeast Asian
                    countries that the risks of providing temporary settlement were not nearly as
                    great as they feared. The Geneva meeting was also the beginning of a major
                    involvement by the non-governmental organizations (NGO). They really began to be
                    involved in refugee work and have grown in importance in this work ever since.
                    It was assistance that surprised and delighted us; we had not expected much help
                    from that quarter. It was one of the beneficial aspects of a policy process
                    which had a goal, but no assurance of success. When we started out, we did not
                    know how the potential permanent settlement countries would react, nor how the
                    southeast Asia countries would respond nor where else we could seek assistance
                    nor how the American public would react. We learned a lot during this
                    process.</p>
                <p>Domestically, it took us first about three months to get Justice Department
                    cooperation for permanent resettlement; then we had to convince Congress to
                    increase the number of Vietnamese refugees that we could allow to immigrate. The
                    vital element in our fight was a TV program which portrayed the life that a
                    boat-full of people were enduring because no country was willing to let them
                    land. Comparisons were made with the Holocaust in Germany and other humanitarian
                    tragedies. Holbrooke and I had prepared all the necessary documents which would
                    allow an increase in U.S. refugee quotas, but we held them until there was a
                    well publicized “boat” case. After that TV show, we submitted our request and
                    doubled the quota. We did the same thing a couple more times in the next fifteen
                    months, deliberately waiting for each new revelation on TV which stirred the
                    conscience of the country; we would then submit a new request for an additional
                    quota increase. We would usually get approval for another increase in a
                    week!</p>
                <p>The refugee program was one aspect of the human rights issue. We had many others
                    in “my” part of the world. Along with southeast Asia, I was also responsible for
                    military assistance, human rights and other functional responsibilities for the
                    whole Bureau. In the human rights area, I worked very closely with Pat Derian.
                    In fact, I was the first person she asked to be her deputy when she was
                    appointed as the Department's Human Rights Coordinator. I didn't know her, but
                    she heard about me from someone. We had a long conversation about her
                    aspirations and goals in the Department and I told her: “Pat, this isn't going
                    to work. The U.S. can not run the world! I think you have to lower your sights
                    and not be so aggressive.” She said she had heard the same excuses from people
                    in Mississippi. I pointed out that the U.S. government could use the 82 Airborne
                    Division to enforce civil rights in the U.S., but could not do so to enforce
                    human rights overseas. After that conversation, I decided that Pat's approach
                    would not work very well and so accepted the offer to work for Holbrooke a few
                    weeks later. But I did end up spending a lot of time on human rights issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>We in EA did have one advantage over other Bureaus when it came to human rights
                    issues. It had been Dick Holbrooke who had written candidate Carter's speeches
                    on human rights during the campaign. So he had considerable credibility when it
                    came to the issue. He may not have been as outspoken a crusader as Pat Derian,
                    but within the administration, Holbrooke was known as a devotee of a strong U.S.
                    position on human rights. So Dick's reputation was considerable help to us in
                    fighting off some of the more extreme positions taken by Pat. We argued for a
                    much more gradual approach in forcing the pace of human rights in EA countries.
                    We also had a difference of view with Pat on how the U.S. meshed the human
                    rights policy with other goals that we were trying to reach in our relationships
                    with various countries. The U.S. has many interests: security, economic, human
                    rights, etc. The best current illustration is China where the Clinton
                    administration is trying to balance all of our various interests. During my
                    time, there were countries like Korea and Phillippines where it was important
                    that all of our concerns be built into our relationships. The HR [Human Rights]
                    Bureau felt that human rights should always have the predominant role in our
                    relationships with other countries and the U.S. should always be very aggressive
                    in pushing the HR agenda with countries like Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia,
                    Korea and Thailand. It is true that many of the FE countries had very bad human
                    rights records; there was no argument on that. But we did have major debates
                    about how fast the U.S. insisted on progress and how human rights concerns
                    meshed with our other policy objectives.</p>
                <p>HR had the right to pass judgement on any proposed U.S. economic assistance
                    proposals and on arms sales proposals to all countries in the world as well as
                    loans from any of the international financial institutions. So Pat Derian had
                    considerable sway over some of the diplomatic tools available to us; economic
                    and military assistance were institutionally tied to human rights. Once a month
                    Warren Christopher, the Deputy Secretary, would chair a meeting that would
                    review all of the requests for assistance on arms transfers proposed by the
                    regional bureaus, with HR sitting in judgement on the human rights situation in
                    each proposed recipient. I used to represent EA at these meetings. We would go
                    through the agenda country by country, reviewing all loans from international
                    institutions, U.S. arms sales and economic assistance and other actions subject
                    to human rights considerations. The bureau would make its argument, HR would
                    agree or disagree and at the end, Christopher would render judgement. It was a
                    fascinating process. By the end of the Carter administration, human rights
                    groups gave our Bureau the signal honor of determining that we had been the
                    Bureau that had more successfully resisted their wishes than any regional bureau
                    in the Department. They considered that ARA [American Republic Affairs] and AF
                    went along easily with the human rights advocates, but EA had held too fast to
                    its view that making human rights the sole concern of U.S. policy would
                    seriously damage our position in Asia without achieving any meaningful progress
                    on human rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>We were more cautious on our approach to human rights than HR would have wanted
                    us to be and we believe it was the correct policy. For example, Holbrooke,
                    Gleysteen and I worked out a policy for Indonesia which we considered far
                    sounder than what HR was pushing. President Suharto sent the head of his
                    military intelligence, General Murdani, to Washington in the summer of 1977 to
                    ask us for two squadrons of F-5 aircraft. They had been promised to Indonesia by
                    President Ford. I met the General and listened to his pitch. I then said to him
                    that I understood his concerns, but that the Carter administration placed
                    considerable more emphasis upon human rights than had any predecessor
                    administration and that security goals were no longer the exclusive U.S.
                    objective. I told him that under the new guidance, I wasn't sure how we would
                    deal with his request. We talked a while and then the General said that
                    governments had to keep their promises, even if made by the previous people. I
                    told him that I agreed with him in principle, but that now we had a different
                    President and administration. I added that I remembered that his President had
                    not too much earlier said that he was about to release the 35,000 ethnic Chinese
                    who had been arrested in 1965. They had been in jail for 12 years. The General
                    looked at me and began to smile. He said: “Of course, you are not linking the
                    sale of the F-5's to the release of the prisoners!” I answered: “Of course not!
                    I was just making the same point that you had made. Presidents have to keep
                    their promises! My next visitor as a matter of fact is the Operations Director
                    of the International Committee of the Red Cross. As you know, they have a large
                    role to play in the whole area of prisoners. Perhaps we can work something out
                    with him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Not long after that, the ICRC was invited by the Indonesians to visit the
                    prisoners and ideas were exchanged about the “right” conditions under which the
                    prisoners could be released. After that we sent a memorandum to Secretary Vance
                    recommending the sale of the two F-5 squadrons to Indonesia. I took it to
                    Derian's office; she rejected our recommendation as being totally unacceptable;
                    she viewed it as an immoral swap of fighter aircraft for people. I pointed out
                    to her that the ethnic Chinese had been in jail for twelve years and that if we
                    didn't do something, they would die in jail - was that human rights? She said
                    that she would not be a party to this “travesty”; she suggested that her name be
                    taken off the memorandum so she would not be recorded as for or against. That we
                    did and sent it to the Secretary who approved it. A year later, the release of
                    these prisoners was touted as one of the administration's great human rights
                    achievements. That was fine with us because we had accomplished both of our
                    objectives: national security and human rights. I think the Indonesian case was
                    a good illustration of how, given the right people and a sensible approach,
                    human rights objectives could be reached without damage to our other very
                    important national security objectives. I am a firm believer in the validity of
                    human rights being a central concern of U.S. policy. I have been both surprised
                    and pleased by how it has taken root and is now a continual concern of all
                    administrations in the U.S. and also by most other countries around the world.
                    At the moment, we may be pushing it too hard and are suffering some backlash
                    because we are perceived by some countries as being sanctimonious, trying to
                    impose our own values on other cultures - suggesting thereby that our values are
                    “better” than those of others. We are also being perceived by some as
                    hypocritical because some see trends in our own society which could be
                    criticized as violations of human rights - economic deprivation, racial biases,
                    social discrimination. Those people suggest that perhaps their approaches are
                    better “human rights” than we practice and suggest that we should perhaps pay
                    more attention to our domestic deficiencies than theirs. But I think the impetus
                    that Carter and Derian gave the human rights agenda has served us well. The
                    Reagan administration used it against some of the communist regimes around the
                    globe in contrast to the Carter administration that focused primarily on
                    pro-western authoritarian regimes. The Reagan approach may have been a cynical
                    use of the agenda, but it nevertheless firmly embodied human rights as a basic
                    tenant of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I believe that in general Derian had a positive impact. As I suggested, I think
                    that in certain instances, she pushed her agenda too far. I don't believe that
                    AF and ARA showed enough gumption in resisting her more far out approaches; they
                    allowed human rights to dominate U.S. relations with their countries perhaps to
                    the detriment of other U.S. objectives - something we were determined not to do.
                    But, as I said, we were in a better position bureaucratically than other bureaus
                    because we had Holbrooke as the Assistant Secretary who had human rights
                    credentials of his own and was very active and skillful in pushing our more
                    modulated, balanced agenda. When Derian took a trip through southeast Asia,
                    Singapore's Foreign Minister kicked her out of his office. I happened to be in
                    Singapore at the same time on other business; so I heard plenty about that!Let
                    me talk a little about our policy towards Indochina during the 1977-79 period.
                    President Carter clearly wanted to normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
                    Within his first couple of months in office, he appointed a high level
                    delegation, headed by Mike Mansfield and including Marion Edelman (from “Save
                    the Children Fund”), Congressmen Sunny Montgomery (a Veterans leader), and James
                    Woodcock (the head of the AFL-CIO), to go to Vietnam. They obviously held out an
                    olive branch; what they got in return was a rejection - “We will never have
                    relationships with the U.S. until you heal the wounds of war” - e.g.
                    reparations. The Vietnamese insisted that Nixon had promised them a lot of
                    assistance which had never been delivered (that promise was clearly in writing
                    and we never disputed the Vietnamese claim), but pointed out their violations of
                    the overall agreement which included this provision. Nevertheless, negotiations
                    were started - these events have been covered well in articles and books. Our
                    focus was on the establishment of diplomatic relations. The negotiations dragged
                    on for a long time. Holbrooke and I along with other people like Fred Brown
                    (Director of the Office of Indochina Affairs), Ken Quinn (Dick's special
                    assistant and now our Ambassador to Cambodia), Liz Verville (from the Legal
                    Counsel's Office), were the U.S. team. The Vietnamese kept insisting that “we
                    had to heal the wounds of war” - i.e we had to pay reparations. That was not in
                    the cards. We told them that there was absolutely no chance that our Congress
                    would appropriate one penny to compensate our “enemy” - in a war that we lost.
                    But we found that the American “friends” of Vietnam, who had given the North
                    counsel during the war, were still advising them now and were advising the
                    Vietnamese to hold out for reparations - they thought that eventually Congress
                    would change its mind. We did our best to try to dissuade the Vietnamese on this
                    point; we told them flatly that the advice they were getting was plain wrong.
                    Nixon was no longer in power and furthermore, they had breached their part of
                    the agreement and therefore any claims that they might have made would not have
                    swayed the Congress.</p>
                <p>Finally, during the Summer of 1978, we began to receive hints that the Vietnamese
                    position was about to change. There were some interesting nuances in some
                    statements they were making on POWS, but officially their line never
                    wavered.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>We began a series of talks with Nguyen Co Thach, the Deputy Foreign Minister,
                    starting in September when he attended the UN General Assembly annual meeting.
                    They kept “dancing around”, but would never officially drop their demands for
                    reparations which we had clearly told them was a “non-starter”. We did suggest
                    that in the normal course of events, they would be eligible for foreign aid,
                    like any less-developed country, once we had established formal diplomatic
                    relations. They understood that we could not promise later assistance in
                    advance, but were describing other situations that might be precedents.</p>
                <p>While these negotiations with the Vietnamese were going on, we were also involved
                    in secret negotiations with the Chinese, aimed at establishing normal diplomatic
                    relations with that country. This was all happening in the summer and fall of
                    1978 - a year for Congressional elections. As [Zbigniew] Brzezinski and Mike
                    Oksenberg [of the NSC] have made clear in their writings, there was some
                    reluctance at the NSC to proceed with normalization with Vietnam under any
                    circumstances because they were concerned that it would interfere with the
                    normalization of relations with China. But as far as Dick and I knew,
                    establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam was still high on the
                    President's agenda - I think we had heard from Vance that Carter still wanted to
                    proceed - as long as there were no reparations involved. Our guidelines included
                    the stipulation that even if the Vietnamese dropped their insistence on
                    reparations, no formal ties would be announced until after the November
                    elections. Our conversations with Congress indicated that there would be some
                    unhappiness among some members, but that on the whole we would have
                    Congressional support - after the elections. Lester Wolfe, the Chairman of the
                    East Asia Sub-Committee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was advising us
                    to proceed, but very carefully.</p>
                <p>In a meeting with Holbrooke and Oksenberg in New York the first week of October,
                    Thach finally dropped his demand for reparation and said Vietnam was ready for
                    diplomatic relations without preconditions. However, those words of caution left
                    us with some “dead” time between the meeting in September and early November. So
                    Holbrooke decided to set up some working groups to discuss the modalities of
                    opening an embassy in Hanoi. The Australians had accepted a situation in which
                    their Ambassador lived in one hotel room and next door, in another room, were
                    his offices. We did not find that acceptable. We wanted to have our old consular
                    building back; furthermore, we wanted permission to send in teams to refurbish
                    it, to install our own communication system and to bring a normal staff for an
                    embassy operation. So there were many details to be discussed. That had to be
                    done, but it was also a means to stall until after the Congressional elections.
                    Our position became that until all the details had been agreed to, we could not
                    proceed with an actual agreement on establishing relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Evelyn Colbert and Pat Barnett, our principal southeast Asia experts in INR
                    [Bureau of Intelligence and Research], spent an hour or two every week with EA
                    during this September-November period analyzing Vietnamese activities at the
                    time. They pointed out that the Vietnamese were massing troops on the Cambodia
                    border; that a new pro-Vietnam “front” organization had been established in
                    Cambodia; that the Vietnamese had just signed a treaty on “Peace and Friendship”
                    with the Soviets; that a large number of “boat” people had just been pushed out
                    to sea. They were very disturbed by these events. The INR analysts were
                    predicting a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Dick Holbrooke had just returned
                    from a trip to the southeast Asia region during which he explained to all
                    countries what we were discussing with Vietnam. He promised to continue
                    consultations with them on our normalization process and promised that we would
                    move very carefully. None of the southeast Asia countries objected to our plans.
                    They were all somewhat nervous, but on balance, agreed that establishment of
                    normal diplomatic relations was probably in the best interest of the area. They
                    were not at that stage ready to give us public support, but we didn't really
                    seek it. However, we immediately recognized that a Vietnamese invasion of
                    Cambodia, followed by U.S. recognition of Vietnam, would destroy our relations
                    with ASEAN, not to mention the serious uproar that would emanate from the U.S.
                    public. The Chinese would also certainly find the two actions unacceptable. Dick
                    instructed me to go to New York to talk to the Vietnamese and to tell them that
                    no further progress could be made on normalization until we had satisfactory
                    answers to three questions: a) what is the significance of the treaty with the
                    USSR?; b) why are so many people being pushed out to seas?; and c) why are there
                    Vietnamese troops being massed on the Cambodia borders? I discussed these three
                    issues with the head of the Vietnamese working group. He denied that any of
                    these three actions had any significance. I finally took him to a corner and
                    told him that Vietnam had been at war for about forty years - Japanese, French,
                    Americans. It was time that his country had some peace. But I added that
                    Vietnam's present course would suggest that it might be in for another ten years
                    of war. His answer was: “We are deathly afraid of the Chinese! The Chinese are
                    massing on our northern borders; they are strengthening their position in
                    Cambodia.” I suggested that there might be other ways to deal with Vietnam's
                    concerns. For example, I suggested that the UN might be asked to establish a
                    “peace-keeping” force on Vietnam's borders; I told the Vietnamese delegate that
                    there were many other options to Vietnam's present course. He insisted that the
                    present course was the only one in which the Vietnamese had any confidence, “the
                    only way we know how” - the old leadership in Hanoi, having fought the Japanese,
                    the French and the Americans only knew the “way of the sword.” That was the most
                    poignant moment of my diplomatic career. We could clearly see what would happen
                    and all the detrimental effects of the Vietnamese policy, but were unable to
                    convince the Vietnamese that there were alternatives to their forty years of
                    fighting. They would invade Cambodia because they were afraid of the Chinese.
                    And that is exactly what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>The Vietnamese were “inscrutable orientals.” They were very careful in what they
                    said - hard to pin down. Of course, we had dealt with Vietnamese over many
                    decades and had never been very successful in dealing with them.I saw my
                    Vietnamese interlocutor again about six months ago. He came to the National
                    Defense University. He again discussed the Vietnamese fear of the Chinese. The
                    Vietnamese felt at the time - and they were not wrong - that the Chinese were in
                    cahoots with the Khmer Rouge and were ready to use their Cambodian allies to
                    infiltrate Vietnam. At the same time, the Chinese were massing troops on the
                    northern Vietnam border and were therefore threatening that country from two
                    directions. The Vietnamese saw a preemptive strike into Cambodia as their sole
                    means of defense against China. So indeed they had a rationale for their
                    decision. I didn't question their rationale; I just was suggesting other
                    possible avenues for defense. But war was the only approach that the Vietnamese
                    knew and that is the course they chose. So when they invaded Cambodia, that
                    ended our dialogue with Vietnam completely. Our stance didn't come as any
                    surprise; I had forewarned them of the consequences of their action when I went
                    to meet with them in New York.</p>
                <p>I must say - as a personal footnote - that I thought Carter's desire to normalize
                    relations with Vietnam and sending a high-level delegation right away may have
                    been premature. I was surprised that Carter took this bold initiative right at
                    the beginning of his term. I had served in Vietnam and therefore I have some
                    personal feelings about that country. Even though I thought the initiative might
                    have been somewhat premature, it didn't trouble me deeply, as undoubtedly
                    recognition would have many Americans. I was not sure that in 1978 the American
                    public was ready for recognition; the POW-MIA issue was still almost completely
                    unresolved. I worked on that and I found it fascinating. Carter had the courage
                    to take the missing Americans off the rolls. In the absence of any evidence to
                    the contrary, he declared them “dead.” That policy was reversed by Reagan when
                    he took office, prolonging our public agony over the issue for another fifteen
                    years, after it had almost been ended by Carter.</p>
                <p>As I said earlier, I believe that if Cambodia had not been invaded and if we had
                    been able to meet all of our needs for recognition of Vietnam, we would have
                    done so even though there would probably have been a uproar in the US. I
                    believed that any uproar could have been overcome and that Congress in the final
                    analysis would have approved recognition and the establishment of diplomatic
                    relationships with Vietnam. In 1978, the conservative wing of our body politic
                    was still in disarray after the end of the Vietnam war, Watergate and the Carter
                    victory. So the sector of our society which would have been most vocal against
                    Vietnam recognition was not at full strength.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I must say that our recognition of Vietnam could well have
                    derailed our negotiations with the Chinese. Brzezinski might have been right in
                    1977-78. The establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam may have been
                    too much for the Chinese to swallow. It might have spurred them on to improve
                    their relations with us; on the other hand, it could just as well have upset
                    them to the extent of terminating their secret negotiations with us. I don't
                    know them well enough to know what their reaction might have been, but as I
                    said, in retrospect, it could have been that Brzezinski was right in 1977-78. I
                    have wondered what might have happened if in the Spring of 1978, the Vietnamese
                    had dropped their precondition. We probably would have recognized them in the
                    Summer - this would have been before our negotiations with China had really
                    picked up speed and before the Vietnamese were getting ready for the Cambodia
                    invasion. What might have happened in Indochina and with China if we had
                    recognized Vietnam in the summer of 1978 makes for very interesting speculation,
                    especially if the Vietnamese had then invaded Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that ANZUS [Australia and New Zealand were] was my
                    responsibility for about two years until Dick hired Evelyn Colbert to take
                    charge of that part of FE. During the time I had oversight for the area, we had
                    very good relations with both Australia and New Zealand. We were working on the
                    series of agreements in the South Pacific which eventually led to Micronesia's
                    independence. That was also a Holbrooke initiative which was finally brought to
                    a satisfactory resolution. Dick quite rightly felt that there was really no
                    further strategic reason for the U.S. to maintain the territorial status of
                    those islands. It made eminent sense in political terms to give Micronesia its
                    independence. Our main problem in the 1977-78 period was that we had too many
                    lawyers working on the drafts - representing all sides. Peter Rosenblatt was
                    Micronesia's chief negotiator at the time. His lawyers - all American - were
                    advising him on how to hold out for a better deal; they were giving us fits.</p>
                <p>As I said earlier, I had only served in Vietnam. The ASEAN countries were all new
                    to me. I found Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia flourishing. Thailand's image in
                    the U.S. was that of a disaster area - the effects of the war, an alleged
                    “economic basket case”. That was certainly not my impression. During my first
                    visit, the first American aircraft carrier visited Thailand since 1973. Many
                    Thai ladies flocked to Pata to meet the ship. I went to Chiang Mai to look at
                    the narcotics situation and found that the town was filled with Thai tourists
                    who had come from Bangkok for the week-end. They were eating rock lobsters from
                    Pata. That suggested to me that the Thai economy might not be in as desperate
                    shape as some of the experts were stating. The economic strength of the country
                    might not have shown up in the GNP statistics - or other econometric measures -
                    but in looking at every day life it was evident that the country had a lot more
                    economic vitality than it was being credited [with].</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I think that my Thai experience was replicated in other southeast Asia countries.
                    I went to Malaysia and was surprised by their successes in developing their
                    natural resources - rubber, palm oil, etc. It was a systematic, sophisticated
                    development program which boded well for that country's economic future.
                    Singapore was already known for its “economic miracle.” I believe that its
                    compactness had much to do with its economic success. They also had Lee Kwan
                    Yew, who although quite a political authoritarian, gave the country good
                    leadership which led to remarkable economic growth, driven in large part by a
                    free market orientation.</p>
                <p>The Philippines was a challenge. The most recent base negotiations, undertaken
                    during the Ford administration, had failed to reach agreement. We had major
                    human rights problems - Aquino was in prison, real political opposition was not
                    allowed, etc. The country was in dire economic straits. On the other hand, we
                    had a long history of close relationships with the Philippines going back for
                    decades and after the war strengthened by our need for military bases. They had
                    been vital during the Vietnam war and we could not after that debacle afford to
                    give up our military position in the Far East. In addition, there were many
                    Filipinos in the U.S. who constituted an important political constituency. Dick
                    tried to balance these interests and did it well. We made some adjustments in
                    our base negotiation strategy; we deliberately let the Pentagon assume the lead
                    in the negotiations. By agreement with them, we put the negotiations in the
                    hands of Admiral Mickey Wisner, who was CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific
                    Command] at the time. Ambassador Dick Murphy in Manila, was instructed to play a
                    supporting role as part of our negotiating team. We thought that a
                    military-to-military negotiation was more likely to bear fruit. We also agreed
                    that the entire draft treaty would be negotiated in the Philippines and sent to
                    Washington for approval only after all the commas and periods had been agreed
                    upon in Manila. We didn't want to have lawyers and others picking the draft to
                    pieces back here in Washington - unlike the Micronesia negotiations. We got the
                    Pentagon to agree to that arrangement. At the same time, using a trip that Vice
                    President Mondale was making to Manila, Dick and Mondale convinced Marcos that
                    he should also turn the Philippine negotiating team over to his military. That
                    infuriated Marcos' cabinet and many Philippine politicians - some were
                    apoplectic. But in fact, it had been the Philippine politicians who had been the
                    problem - always grasping for more “goodies” - power, perks, cuts, etc. That had
                    been a problem that Phil Habib, our chief negotiator, had not been able to
                    overcome. By changing the negotiating teams, we managed to reach agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>For example, one of the issues under contention had been who had authority over
                    the waters in Subic Bay. Our military had insisted that we had to have
                    jurisdiction over the whole area - unlike the State Department which believed
                    that an authority limited to only certain functions would have been acceptable.
                    When our military took charge of the negotiations, they did a complete turn
                    around. All of a sudden, the Pentagon found jurisdiction over just some
                    specified activities in the Subic Bay waters quite acceptable. It was willing to
                    accept the general thesis that Subic Bay waters were under Philippine
                    sovereignty as long as there was agreement on a list of functions over which the
                    U.S. had total control. That compromise was certainly acceptable to the
                    Philippines. That move by the Pentagon was key to reaching agreement. I found
                    the psychological change in our military fascinating to watch as they moved from
                    just being members of a delegation to the spearhead.</p>
                <p>As soon as the negotiations started, the House and Senate Foreign Relations and
                    Armed Services Committees had to be briefed. We did that regularly every month
                    during the negotiations which took about a year. These briefings came at our
                    initiative; we in State took the lead, but the briefing teams were a joint
                    DOS-DOD effort. I think the Members and staff were somewhat taken aback by our
                    volunteering to give these briefings - it doesn't happen often in
                    Legislative-Executive branch relations. We told them that we just wanted to make
                    sure they were up to date on the negotiations. Then Dick enlisted the assistance
                    of Senator Inouye - of Hawaii - who had very close ties to Marcos and was also
                    the chairman of the appropriations sub-committee. As the negotiators appeared to
                    be reaching agreement, Marcos was still holding out for more than we were
                    willing to give. The Senator went to Manila at Dick's suggestion and told Marcos
                    that he could increase the FMS (foreign military sales) level for the
                    Philippines by $5 million to improve the effectiveness of Philippines' defense,
                    but that was the limit of U.S. largesse. He also told Marcos that the longer he
                    held out, the more difficult it would be to obtain congressional approval of any
                    assistance - time was not on Marcos' side. Inouye strongly recommended that
                    Marcos seal the deal right away, if he wanted an agreement at all. That did it;
                    Marcos gave his approval and the final agreement was reached. So the strategy of
                    keeping Congress informed throughout the negotiations and Inouye's personal
                    involvement made congressional approval very easy; we had no problem with the
                    legislative branch. I think the whole process was very skillfully managed.
                    Brzezinski had some reservations, but the Inouye-Vance combination was very
                    helpful in overcoming NSC reluctance and obtaining Carter's final approval of
                    the base agreement. We had to overcome not only Marcos' ever-present appetite
                    for U.S. money, but also the political problems we had with the Philippines. In
                    fact, their military was very useful in that respect because they were much more
                    willing to go along with some of our political demands than the Filipino
                    politicians. The Filipino military establishments' number one priority was a
                    close relationship with their American counterparts; their second goal was
                    additional military equipment. The other matters that had been so important to
                    the politicians did not come close to the other two objectives. That factor in
                    fact was vital to bringing the agreement to fruition in a hurry.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>The bases were obviously our number one priority in the Philippines. Reaching our
                    goal was certainly complicated by Marcos' poor record on human rights. Dick
                    managed to balance these two problems; for example, whenever he was in the
                    Philippines, he would visit Aquino in prison. That made our position on human
                    rights quite visible, but did not do so in a way that might have ruptured our
                    relations with the Philippines and the possibility of reaching a bases
                    agreement. We did make the point that we considered Aquino's treatment important
                    and that in general we were not happy with Marcos' human rights record. From
                    Marcos' point of view, the issue was just how much U.S. interference he could
                    accept. We also pressured the Philippines to open a refugee holding camp. It was
                    a tough fight, but we finally succeeded. There was some question of
                    compensation, which we finally negotiated to the Filipinos' satisfaction.</p>
                <p>By 1978, it was quite clear that Marcos' support was waning. We didn't
                    necessarily believe that his days were numbered, but we were not at all pleased
                    with his conduct of Philippine affairs. It was obvious that his popularity had
                    slipped considerably. It was evident to me and other observers that the
                    Philippines had more internal conflicts than any other ASEAN country - followed
                    by Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and then Singapore. Of the five, certainly the
                    Phillippines and Indonesia were lagging economically; neither country had yet
                    “taken off.” All U.S. investments in Indonesian oil development had stopped
                    because Treasury and IRS were interpreting the tax laws in a way that might make
                    oil revenues taxable in both Indonesia and the US. The U.S. oil companies were
                    unable to obtain a ruling which would assist them in determining what the fiscal
                    consequences of the Treasury and IRS rulings might be. Treasury in fact was
                    saying that the oil companies should proceed with their development and then the
                    U.S. government would tell them what their tax liabilities would be. That
                    naturally discouraged any further U.S. investment in oil development in
                    Indonesia. This situation lasted for about two years. Finally Dick was able to
                    convince Mondale, before he left on his Southeast Asia trip, that he had to have
                    a more satisfactory U.S. position from Treasury on tax liabilities than was
                    available at the time. For taking that stand, Mondale was criticized for “having
                    sold out to the oil interests.” But he did get the necessary clarification which
                    then in turn translated into the return of U.S. oil companies to the Indonesian
                    oil fields. That was another example of how useful the Mondale trip was.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I mentioned Erland Heginbotham earlier. He was a superb economist. For example,
                    in cooperation with the combined American Chambers of Commerce in Asia, he
                    directed a study of the economic competition that U.S. companies were facing in
                    Southeast Asia from Japan and the Europeans. It was clear from that study that
                    our inadequate penetration of that market was having a negative effect on our
                    trade balance and our investment position. We operated under such legislation as
                    the Anti-trust Act and the Corrupt Practices Act which were tying the hands of
                    our companies, forcing them to operate with handicaps which our competitors did
                    not have. Unfortunately, the study, despite its clear conclusions and
                    documentation, did not have the impact necessary to change the competitive
                    environment, but it was a brilliant study nevertheless. If people had responded
                    to it, we would be much further along - in the business area - in Southeast Asia
                    than we are. One day, Holbrooke and I were attending a meeting of the Economic
                    Policy Council, chaired by [Treasury] Secretary Blumenthal. Deputy Secretary
                    Christopher was the senior State official present. By the time the meeting was
                    over, Bob Strauss, then STR [Senior Trade Representative], had gotten approval
                    to be the lead official in the U.S. government on all aspects of our economic
                    relations with Japan. Dick was very upset by this decision. We left that meeting
                    and headed for the White House's south lawn to await the arrival of Prime
                    Minister “Piggy” Muldoon of New Zealand. While waiting for the helicopter, Dick
                    took Mondale and Vance aside to explain to them what had happened at the
                    Economic Policy Council. He told them that putting Strauss in charge was just
                    impossible. I had to go off with Muldoon, but I caught up with Dick the next
                    morning in his office. While I was there, the phone rang; it was Bob Strauss.
                    Dick picked it up and listened to Strauss screaming at him for about five
                    minutes. Finally, after he calmed down, Strauss said that Dick had been the only
                    one in that room who had been smart enough to catch what had happened and to see
                    its consequences and the only guy in the room smart enough to get the decision
                    reversed. He then asked Dick what would happen next. Dick said: “Bob, I am all
                    in favor of you being the man out in front on Japanese economic questions. But I
                    can not turn all of the policy making responsibilities over to you. I suggest
                    that you be the front man, but that Erland Heginbotham be your chief staff man.”
                    Strauss accepted the proposal on the spot. That solution made everybody happy.
                    That was a good illustration of Holbrooke modus operandi: very political, very
                    active; he produced results that were vital to moving our policy objectives
                    forward - sometimes irritating a wide variety of people.</p>

                <p>My three years in EA were more than busy; I was hopping every moment. When [Bill]
                    Gleysteen went to Korea as ambassador, I became the senior deputy in the Bureau.
                    That added work, as the following anecdote will illustrate. When the Vietnamese
                    invaded Cambodia, the Chinese moved some troops south to “teach the Vietnamese a
                    lesson” - this was around the beginning of 1979. The negotiations with China
                    were just about to come to fruition allowing the establishment of diplomatic
                    relations. All of these events coming to head at about the same time demanded
                    that Holbrooke stay in Washington, leaving me to chair a Chiefs of Mission
                    conference in Bangkok. It had been scheduled for that time to coincide with a
                    visit that a delegation from the Senate Armed Services Committee was to make to
                    Thailand and other EA posts. That delegation was headed by Senator Nunn and had
                    on it also Senators Glenn, Cohen and Hart. We persuaded Lester Wolfe to come to
                    Bangkok at the same time. Our meeting was to last three days: on Thursday, we
                    were to take up security matters, on Friday trade and other commercial matters,
                    and Saturday was reserved for a round up session with the Members of Congress.
                    During that last session, I remember Hart saying to Erland that “big business
                    was bad politics. You ivory tower diplomats don't understand.” That brought a
                    strong reaction from Woodcock and [Mike] Mansfield who told Hart that he didn't
                    understand either politics or the Asian economics. They both said that they, as
                    non-career ambassadors, strongly supported what the career ambassadors had said.
                    They added that as a matter of fact, they would even go further and told the
                    Senators that unless they gave greater support to U.S. investments in and trade
                    with Asia, unemployment in the U.S. would rise while the Asian economies would
                    boom. That would be a political disaster for the US. It was a fascinating debate
                    among seasoned politicians with one side reluctant to take any steps that might
                    appear big business - as being poor politics - and the other, strongly supported
                    by the professional diplomats, just jumping down their throats. The fact that
                    Mansfield and Woodcock sided with us was a real morale booster.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Subsequently, we followed up with those four senators to help us with the
                    problems raised by Carter's campaign statement that he would withdraw U.S.
                    troops from South Korea. Carter subsequently drew a time table for this
                    withdrawal; then most people came to realize that such action would be a large
                    mistake - some sooner than others. The Senate Armed Forces Committee issued a
                    statement saying that the withdrawal would be a huge mistake. Vance and
                    Holbrooke met with them before those Senators were scheduled to meet with the
                    President on this issue and convinced them to really press Carter so that he
                    might understand the problems that his policy might engender. They then told the
                    President that they understood that a major policy review was underway in the
                    Executive Branch; they promised to make no further critical public statements
                    pending the conclusion of that review. In fact, the policy review had been
                    completed, but we managed to keep that fact secret by having various parts of it
                    done in different parts of the Executive Branch. None of the parts reached any
                    recommendations, but the conclusions were self-evident. All the different parts
                    were assembled in a closed area of the Pentagon and delivered to the President
                    just before he took off for a trip to Northeast Asia. So he read the complete
                    report while flying to Korea. On that trip, he came to the conclusion that troop
                    withdrawal was not a wise move - not only from the report, but also from what
                    everyone told him in Korea and Japan. This was another example of Holbrooke's
                    ability to work closely with Congress and use members to good advantage.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I might just add as a footnote my recollections of Carter's efforts to contact
                    North Korea while he was in Seoul. Don Oberdorfer's book has a full chapter on
                    that episode, so I won't repeat all the details. When the Carter delegation left
                    Washington, we didn't know that he would be making a specific proposal, although
                    the idea of trying to initiate some contacts with North Korea had been discussed
                    in Washington. In Seoul, Carter proposed a tripartite meeting that would have
                    included the two Koreas and the U.S. Oberdorfer describes the various activities
                    surrounding the troop withdrawal issue as sort of a conspiracy by the
                    bureaucracy and the Legislative Branch to try to get Carter to change his mind.
                    I think the Carter initiative was very much more a public relations ploy than a
                    serious proposal which would elicit a North Korean response. But Carter wanted
                    to do something and much to our surprise, the South Koreans went along. Once
                    they had approved, then the question became one of mechanics. Although I was not
                    the responsible deputy for Northeast Asia, I was with the Carter party as sort
                    of a supernumerary. I was at the Embassy in Seoul while everyone else was at the
                    State dinner hosted by President Park Chung Hee. The U.S. proposal had to be
                    sent to North Korea via Indonesia - one of the very few countries that had
                    diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington. Among countries which
                    might have served as intermediaries or potential site for such tripartite
                    meeting was India - which didn't please us very much - and Indonesia, which was
                    acceptable. The challenge was to get the invitation delivered to North Korea
                    quickly because Carter wanted to hold a press conference in 48 hours after
                    getting Park's approval to announce the initiative. So I was one of the first to
                    see a cable from Ambassador Masters - our man in Djakarta - saying that he had
                    not been able to contact the Indonesian Foreign Minister, who was busy at an
                    ASEAN meeting and would not talk to Masters. There was no way that Masters could
                    talk to Suharto without seeing the Foreign Minister first. So Masters concluded
                    that we were stymied. I didn't accept that conclusion and called the CIA Station
                    Chief in Seoul and asked him to send a message to his colleague in Djakarta to
                    have him go see General Murdani - the head of Indonesian Military Intelligence -
                    whom I have mentioned earlier. I wanted our problem explained to the General to
                    see whether he could not get our proposal to Suharto. Four hours later, we
                    received a response through CIA channels that Suharto was delivering the
                    proposal to the North Korean ambassador in Djakarta. Eventually, we heard that
                    North Korea was not interested; that didn't come as any great surprise to me and
                    my colleagues; we always viewed it primarily as a public relations ploy. What
                    Carter thought, I don't know, but all the professionals were in agreement that
                    the proposal wouldn't fly. I must say that my relations with Masters and the
                    Indonesian Foreign Minister were never the same after this episode!</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>I always worried that Dick might become a victim of his relationships with
                    members of Congress, but he managed them very well. Almost every week - early in
                    a day - he would have two or three members in his office, before they went to
                    their offices on the Hill [Capitol Hill]. He served juice and coffee and a
                    discussion. He made a point during these meetings of never lobbying them on a
                    specific issue; he used these sessions primarily as briefing opportunities. One
                    day, Senator Stone (D-Florida) said that it was the third time he had been in
                    the EA Bureau for “breakfast” and that he had twice attended Dick's staff
                    meetings. He noted that he was just a member of the East Asian sub-committee of
                    the SFR [Senate Foreign Relations Committee], but that he was the chairman of
                    the Near East sub-committee and yet had never been invited by the NEA the Bureau
                    to anything. So after Stone made that remark, I called Hal Saunders, the NEA
                    Assistant Secretary and reported Stone's comments. Hal said that the Bureau of
                    Congressional Relations (H) did not like such “extra curricular” contacts. My
                    answer was: “Who cares?” Dick didn't care much about bureaucratic sensibilities;
                    he wanted to have direct relationships with members of Congress. He saw H as a
                    barrier and not a bridge and was not helpful to him and his policy objectives.
                    Dick's political instincts were exceptional as we have recently seen in the
                    Bosnia situation.</p>
                <p>My tour in EA was fascinating and exciting. Fast moving, very difficult. Dick
                    Holbrooke was certainly not easy to work with. But the three years were
                    rewarding. I learned a lot, particularly from watching Holbrooke operate. But I
                    could never act in the same way. Our styles are very different. His style was
                    very effective and very unusual for a professional diplomat. It is one that
                    might be found more often in people raised in politics. I used as many of
                    Holbrooke's techniques in subsequent assignments, but I did not have the
                    facility he had because I just don't operate the way Dick does. The three years
                    with Dick re-enforced a valuable lesson: have as many contacts as you can in as
                    many places you can and use them and don't be limited by the confines of the so
                    called “system” - which frequently doesn't work, as we all know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1979, you were appointed as our Ambassador to
                        Zaire. Hodid that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: After consultation with Phyllis, we had agreed that we had been in
                    Washington long enough and that the time had come to return to the field. As a
                    Foreign Service officer, five years in Washington was long enough. Holbrooke, as
                    usual, was very clever. When I told him that I wanted a field assignment, he
                    said he would take it under advisement; he said he understood my rationale, but
                    that he hated to see me leave his staff. Some days later, he called me into his
                    office and said that the only Embassy that was available for someone like me was
                    Zaire. I immediately told him I would accept - perhaps somewhat to his surprise.
                    I hadn't been in Africa for several years, but I knew enough about Zaire to
                    realize that it would not be a dull assignment. We had plenty of problems there
                    and in the neighboring countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Our Embassy in Kinshasa was substantial. We had a medium size AID mission. We had
                    a big Peace Corps operation - which of course was not officially part of the
                    Embassy - we had a Defense Attach� Office, which fortunately had a good airplane
                    that became my main means of transportation around the country since there were
                    very few roads. We had a Defense Representative Office to handle military
                    assistance. We had a large CIA station. So it was a fair size Embassy. I think
                    the staff was good, particularly the three political and two economic officers.
                    The DCMs, first Alan Davis and then Ted McNamara, were excellent. Jennifer Ward,
                    the chief of the Political Section, was great. John Heimann, the head of the
                    Economic Section, was superb. Wendy Chamberlain was an excellent political
                    officer. So I was blessed with some top notch talent.</p>
                <p>I think the staff worked very well together. There was some friction - there were
                    a few who didn't think we were being sufficiently aggressive on human rights and
                    were anxious for the Embassy to have closer relationships with opposition
                    leaders. That was partly a generation gap and partly an experience gap. My
                    advice to the staff was not to get too close to opposition leaders, but one of
                    my political officers did engage in very close contact with a member of the
                    opposition only to find out that his conversations had been taped. That was
                    brought to my attention by Mobutu's security chief. I managed to explain it
                    away, but I did have a long chat with that officer. After that I think he had a
                    better appreciation of my warnings about contacts with the opposition. I didn't
                    think we helped the opposition at all by making them targets of Mobutu's secret
                    police. We had to be much more circumspect about our contacts with the
                    opposition. After that incident, I think the staff understood and became much
                    more careful - the younger officers learned to temper their enthusiasm and
                    idealism with reality and experience and thereby became better officers.</p>
                <p>The first problem in Zaire, of course, was Mobutu. He had been in power for
                    fourteen years. We had put him there in an effort to get a pro-western leader
                    for Zaire who could stabilize the political situation. Mobutu certainly did that
                    - by assuming all powers unto himself, as did many African leaders. He was very
                    clever in handling the domestic political situation; no one could unseat him and
                    almost no one could budge him on his modus operandi, which was hardly benevolent
                    and certainly didn't incorporate Carter's views on human rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Mobutu had a tremendous amount of charisma, human magnetism, charm. He was also a
                    brilliant schemer and plotter. There were several Washington “experts” who in
                    1979, didn't think Mobutu would last very much longer. When I had an opportunity
                    to survey the situation on the ground, I came to the conclusion that there was
                    no chance of Mobutu leaving - certainly not in the short or even medium term. He
                    was able to take the measure of his opposition, he manipulated them, brought
                    people into his government so that they would have an opportunity to “eat from
                    the trough”; then he dismissed them and brought in another set to alleviate
                    their hunger pains. He lived lavishly and flamboyantly. I found him not very
                    convivial and not pleasant to deal with. For example, during my whole three year
                    tour, though we had a substantial assistance program - mostly economic but also
                    some military - Mobutu always complained about the level of resources we were
                    providing. He insisted that what we were giving Zaire did not match what the
                    USSR was providing Ethiopia, Angola or other satraps in Africa. Not once do I
                    remember Mobutu making any comments or showing any interest in the benefits that
                    our assistance was providing his country. He was neither grateful or interested;
                    he just wanted more. He was much more concerned with the aid levels that he was
                    getting in comparison to other African regimes.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that Zairean government ministers came and went, according to
                    Mobutu's whims. But he did have a close coterie around himself - some of whom
                    amazingly enough are still with him. It was a very small group of advisors,
                    mostly from his own tribe and his home town. He managed the country as a chief
                    would rule his tribe; that was hardly appropriate and Zaire was not managed
                    well. For example, the social services - education, public health, etc. - for
                    the interior of the country were provided almost exclusively by missionaries or
                    Peace Corps volunteers, of which there were many. The Catholic Church, run by
                    Belgians, had a large network. There were a number of American Protestant
                    missionaries in Zaire. Hospitals and clinics in the interior always suffered
                    from a lack of medicines; often there was no fuel for generators - if the
                    facility even had a generator. The schools lacked supplies. These deficiencies
                    seemed to be almost miraculously overcome when Mobutu came to visit; for about
                    two weeks before the visit and for a week after, there were no shortages. Then
                    the shortages would start again. That was Mobutu's governing style. He himself
                    amassed large amounts of money and was very lavish in dispensing largesse to his
                    friends and followers. No major decisions ever were taken without his
                    approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>It was clear in 1979 that Zaire's economy was in decline. The price of copper on
                    the world market had fallen; the price of transportation had risen. Other
                    minerals also suffered from declining prices. So it became uneconomic to ship
                    some of the ore out of Zaire - the purchase price was below the transportation
                    cost. Copper made a little money still, but the transportation costs - barge,
                    truck, ship, railroad - were very high. Except for beat up barges, the
                    transportation system within Zaire was almost non-existent. There was a
                    sea-level railroad that had run across from Angola to Mozambique, designed to
                    provide quick, cheap transport for mineral ores during the colonial days. But
                    that line was cut during the Angolan insurrection in the 1960s. So it was very
                    slow and expensive to move minerals from the mines to the markets. And the ore
                    prices kept dropping.</p>
                <p>There were large public buildings in Kinshasa, but they were never maintained.
                    The U.S. had contributed to Zaire's infrastructure. We had financed an electric
                    transmission line from the hydro-electric dam in Inga - right outside of
                    Kinshasa - to the copper mines in Shaba - about 1,000 kilometers through the
                    center of the country. It had to be direct current [d.c.] transmission to get
                    enough power from generator to consumption and became the longest transmission
                    line in the world, requiring some very modern and new technology because it
                    needed lots of alternators - each of which was about the size a football field
                    with ceilings 100 feet high. They were all covered with a smooth metal - zinc,
                    perhaps. And the electricity would arc back and forth across the alternator. The
                    same was true at the receiving end when the d.c had to be converted into a.c.
                    [alternative current] Morris-Knudsen built the line, with the Swedes building
                    the machinery. We worked hard to get the line completed - it had been under
                    construction for a number of years. But with the fall in copper prices and the
                    rise in transportation costs, there was not a great demand for the electric
                    flash smelters that were supposed to be erected so they were not built. The line
                    could not be tapped, even when it ran through a village of 1 million
                    inhabitants. The electricity went right overhead and could not be used by this
                    city which had to continue to use the few small generators that it had. It would
                    have required some very high tech devices to turn the d.c. power into a.c. and
                    would have cost around $15 million. No one had that kind of money, so the poor
                    villagers watched all this power go by them, without being able to use it - in
                    fact, it was hardly used at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Corruption was endemic; it was huge. In the 1970s, Mobutu had nationalized -
                    expropriated - a large number of Belgian and Portuguese commercial enterprises -
                    firms and factories. They were turned over without any compensation to the
                    former owners to Mobutu's friends and family. He got a cut from those
                    operations. Eventually, most of these enterprises went broke, but not before
                    they had enriched Mobutu's coffers. He also diverted funds generated from the
                    sale of native natural resources - diamonds, copper, cobalt, coffee, cocoa,
                    rubber, etc. The sale of these resources were all controlled by state marketing
                    operations. Mobutu and his entourage got a cut from those revenues. In one
                    particular situation, we thought we had plugged tightly all possibilities for
                    bribery and diversion of moneys. We had a World Bank team in the Gecomines
                    office - that was the state corporation that handled the mining and sale of
                    copper and cobalt, the principal export resource and greatest revenue source for
                    Zaire. The IMF had a team in the Central Bank. We thought with all that expert
                    manpower, we could reduce if not eliminate the diversion of revenues. We soon
                    discovered, through some very good work by CIA and our commercial people and our
                    Embassy in Brussels, that the Zaireans were falsifying shipping documents. These
                    documents showed only half of the actual shipments of cobalt - which was the
                    most expensive resource. All Zairean official documents showed far fewer
                    shipments than were actually taking place - they did not match the loading
                    documents that were prepared at the port by the shippers themselves which we
                    obtained. The actual amounts being shipped were twice the amounts shown on
                    official Zairean documents. Then we discovered that the Belgian bank - Societe
                    Generale - that was handling most of the Zairean foreign exchange had worked out
                    a deal with Mobutu and his cronies which in effect did not credit the Zairean
                    Central Bank with all the revenues generated by the sale of the resources. That
                    prevented the IMF from monitoring the use of funds in the Central Bank; the
                    Belgian bank held the balance in Brussels in the personal accounts of Mobutu and
                    his cronies. He did share some of these illegal profits with his Belgian
                    buddies, so that everyone, except the Zairean people benefitted. The Belgian
                    foreign minister was one of the directors of the Belgian bank. I once asked the
                    Belgian Ambassador in Kinshasa about that situation. He told me that in Belgium
                    there was no such thing as “conflict of interest;” having the Foreign Minister
                    sit as a member of a Board of Directors of a bank involved in foreign
                    transactions was perfectly normal.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I don't know whether Jackie Onassis' friend Maurice Tempelsman was involved in
                    corruption, but he had extensive business interests in Zaire. He was an
                    important American business man. One of his two principal employees in Zaire was
                    the former CIA Station Chief, Larry Devlin, who helped a lot when Mobutu was put
                    in power in 1965. The other, John Cerages, had been the Embassy's Defense
                    Attach� at that time. I will never forget the first evening we were in Kinshasa.
                    We were invited for dinner at the house of a senior Embassy officer. These two
                    men were there and I had to listen to them telling me how delighted they were
                    that I had arrived; everything was set and my life would be very easy because,
                    as had been the case in the past, whenever the American Ambassador had any
                    difficulties, he would come to them and they would work out satisfactory
                    arrangements with Mobutu. After their intercession, as had been true in the
                    past, then I could go to Mobutu confident that I would get the appropriate
                    response because they had paved the way. I listen to this “educational program”
                    for about an hour - which for me was probably a record for restraint and
                    patience. Finally, I told them I would not operate as they suggested my
                    predecessors had done. In fact, I had heard that their description of the
                    process had been true when Sheldon Vance had been Ambassador from a good friend,
                    Bob Whittinghill, who had been Vance's Station Chief in Kinshasa several years
                    earlier, but I told the two Americans that the system would not work that way on
                    my watch. In Vance's case, when the “advance spade work,” done by Whittinghill,
                    indicated a negative answer, the DCM would be sent to the Foreign Minister with
                    whatever request the U.S. had. If the response were likely to be positive, then
                    Vance would go see Mobutu. But in any case, I told Devlin and Gerages that I
                    thought their proposal was a very bad idea because Mobutu was bound to be
                    confused between requests made by two private Americans and requests made by the
                    U.S. government.</p>
                <p>Sometime later, I asked the Station Chief to come to my office. I told him that I
                    wanted him to understand one thing: regardless of past practices, he was not to
                    see Mobutu alone or to see him at all without my prior approval. He noted that
                    in the past, there had been no limitations on his relationships with Mobutu;
                    that had been true for his predecessors as well. I insisted that we start a new
                    way of dealing with Mobutu. He said that he would refer the matter to his
                    headquarters. What the Station Chief did not know was that I had worked out this
                    new arrangement with Frank Carlucci, the Deputy Director of CIA, before leaving
                    Washington. So much to the Station Chief's surprise, he got an order from CIA
                    headquarters that he was to follow my instructions. Since then there was an
                    agreement that the Ambassador had that authority at all posts. This is just one
                    illustration of the sometime free-wheeling operations conducted by CIA overseas.
                    Mort Abramowitz had similar experience in Thailand with his Station Chief. I
                    call these places the “flagship stations” where the CIA was accustomed to
                    dealing directly with Presidents or Prime Ministers without Ambassadorial
                    involvement and sometimes even knowledge. The head of state assumes logically
                    that CIA is the authoritative channel of communications with the U.S.
                    government; I was not going to buy that and got it changed in Zaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>I had some vague hopes that Zaire's economy might improve. That is why we worked
                    very closely with the IMF and the World Bank, both on the macroeconomics and on
                    development projects. We used to collude with these international bodies; we
                    would review the economic situation together and try to agree on a course of
                    action. Then we would agree on which one of us would take the initiative.
                    Sometimes we would volunteer - after all I was already in so much hot water with
                    Mobutu that another fight didn't make that much difference. Sometimes the
                    international institutions would take the lead. So we tried to work together
                    both on the development of an economic strategy and the necessary
                    implementations. We spent a lot of time trying to improve our own bilateral
                    projects as did the Bank on theirs. We both aimed to make our projects much more
                    labor intensive trying to move [away] from large schemes which after completion
                    would have required skilled manpower that Zaire did not have. There were few
                    very educated people left in Zaire; those who had education, had fled and would
                    not return. We started again to emphasize projects which involved the local
                    populations, similar to the projects that were undertaken in the Belgian
                    colonial era. That made more sense than the grandiose schemes that Mobutu and
                    his entourage thought should be undertaken. As I said, we worked very hard on
                    redirecting the aid program, but there was too much inertia in the Zairean
                    government - it was too weak and didn't care enough and the “boss” - Mobutu -
                    couldn't have cared less.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the point I am trying to make, let me tell you one story. In 1981,
                    Zaire had a very good Minister of Agriculture, Kamitatu. He had been politically
                    active before independence. He was a charmer and schemer, but cared a lot for
                    Zaire. Together with him, we developed a new agricultural project which was to
                    benefit each province. Each would receive ten trucks - Japanese and Italian -
                    provided by those countries - 100 from the Japan and fifty from Italy. We
                    provided seed, other governments donated tools. We were very careful to guard
                    these supplies as best we could. We had Peace Corps volunteers and other
                    Americans drive the trucks and materials from the port. It did take us quite a
                    while to get all the ducks in a row since there were so many governments
                    involved, working primarily through their ambassadors in Kinshasa.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The night before this caravan of trucks was supposed to leave the city and fan
                    out to all the provinces, all the vehicles were stolen, apparently in accordance
                    with instructions from cabinet ministers and leading politicians. That made it
                    impossible to launch the project. I was enraged; I personally drove around town
                    and looked for the trucks. I found most of them, sitting in the yards of various
                    high officials. My pleas for the return of the trucks got me nowhere. The Prime
                    Minister was no help; the Minister of Agriculture was helpless because in part
                    his colleagues had taken the trucks to undercut him - he was being too
                    successful. I finally wrote Mobutu a letter, venting my outrage and telling him
                    that the action of his cabinet and other close advisers was totally
                    unacceptable. I told him what I knew had happened and expressed my disbelief
                    that anything like this might happen. A few hours later I received a call from
                    Mobutu's intelligence chief, telling me that the President was very upset. I
                    said that made two of us. He asked me why I had put the story in writing, I told
                    him that was the only way I had found to communicate with the President. The
                    intelligence chief said to me that, “Letters leave traces.” I noted that, “The
                    disappearance of trucks into the yards of cabinet members does too” and hung up.
                    I will tell you later the consequences of this episode, but I just wanted to
                    relate it at this point as an illustration of some of the problems we were
                    facing in Zaire.</p>
                <p>I must say that my Washington briefings had been quite good. I was not surprised
                    by anything I found in Zaire. I was told that we were trying to pursue a variety
                    of interests in Zaire simultaneously, which required considerable agility. We
                    were trying to promote economic reform; we were trying to promote at least a
                    degree of political reform - we were not pushing for a democratic state, but we
                    did want to reduce the human rights abuses and increase political participation
                    by the Zairean people. There were some in the U.S. - the Human Rights Bureau and
                    some NGOs - who were frustrated that we did not push harder for a democratic
                    state. They wanted a more aggressive stance, but I thought they were going too
                    far, too fast because we had other interests that also had to be protected. I
                    didn't see anyway in which Mobutu would become truly democratic - nor did we
                    have the power to force a change in leadership even in the unlikely event that
                    we might have found a true democrat in Zaire.</p>
                <p>For example, we had to worry about corruption even in our own assistance
                    programs. We found that rice provided under PL 480 was being diverted; that
                    meant we had to stop the program when the Zairean officials would not heed our
                    warnings. The cessation of the program upset some of the American rice growers
                    as well as Mobutu and some of the other culprits. But in Zaire, we had to watch
                    everything; if it wasn't nailed down, it would be stolen.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>We were also interested in fostering American business. We had some oil companies
                    operating in Zaire as well as some who were conducting explorations. We also had
                    obvious “Cold War” interests; we did not want Zaire to be subverted or
                    infiltrated or attacked from some socialist neighbor like Zambia or Angola. And
                    this was the time when the civil war in Angola was raging with the U.S. backing
                    Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for Total Independence (UNITA) -
                    a pro-west faction - against the government supported by the Cubans and the
                    Soviets. That war had started right after Portugal had given Angola its
                    independence in 1974. Then there was Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other African
                    states that were not pro-west. This vision of Zaire as a bastion of a
                    pro-western state amidst a sea of Soviet supported states was not changed much
                    when Reagan succeeded Carter. Both administrations viewed this part of Africa
                    through the prism of the Cold War. There was probably a greater emphasis on
                    human rights during the Carter administration, although we continued to raise
                    the issue with Mobutu even during the Reagan administration - to Mobutu's
                    considerable surprise and discomfort. As we had done in the Carter
                    administration, we tried to balance our policy so that we could try to reach our
                    multi-faceted objectives.</p>
                <p>We used Zaire as a support base for our activities in support of Savimbi. I was
                    not directly involved in those operations, although I did meet Savimbi a couple
                    of times to convey messages to him from the President or the State Department.
                    But my involvement was rather limited - not nearly as much as it was to be later
                    in our Afghan operations.</p>
                <p>I was generally supportive of our policies in Zaire. I was not idealistic enough
                    to believe that we could transform Zaire into a democracy. I was realistic
                    enough to understand that there were limitations on our power and influence.
                    Moreover, even if those limitations had not existed, we should have imposed
                    limitations on ourselves. It was not our job to go around overthrowing African
                    chiefs of state just because we didn't like their policies. But I thought we
                    could ameliorate some of Mobutu's extreme tendencies and we worked hard on that.
                    We did make some progress; we did get some prisoners released; we obtained
                    permission for the ICRC to inspect the prisons. The progress was moderate, but
                    at least it was progress.</p>

                <p>The same was true on economic reform, although later Mobutu welshed on his
                    promises. At one point, he decided that he had enough of the IMF meddling into
                    his affairs, monitoring the Central Bank on how assistance was being used. He
                    also didn't like the World Bank overseeing the activities of the mining
                    companies. Mobutu warned both institutions that their days in Zaire were
                    numbered. Much to his astonishment, we fought back. All of this happen towards
                    the end of the Carter administration. Soon after Reagan's election, Mobutu
                    hinted that he would like to be invited to Washington - he would not go while
                    Carter was in the White House, but after 1981, he felt “his Republican friends”
                    were in power and that he would like to visit them. He was quite shocked when
                    Lannon Walker and I accompanied [Vernon] “Dick” Walters - our Ambassador to the
                    UN at the time - to a meeting he was having with Mobutu in Paris. Walters had
                    always had a very close personal relationship with Mobutu. Walters at this
                    meeting delivered a letter from Reagan which said that the U.S. would be glad to
                    have Mobutu visit Washington, but only after Zaire got back into the good graces
                    of the IMF and the World Bank. There were also some other stipulations, mainly
                    in the area of economic reform. Mobutu, after reading the letter, burst into a
                    rage and said that he would never visit the U.S. again. His advisors faces
                    turned grey in horror. Walters, very adroitly, rose and said that he guessed
                    that was the end of the meeting since there was nothing else to talk about.
                    Mobutu, courteous as always, also rose and escorted Walters to the door, saying
                    that perhaps he and Dick should have a private chat. So the two went into a
                    separate room where I was told Mobutu burst into tears because he was upset. He
                    claimed he was so shocked, that in his mind, Reagan acted just like Carter. He
                    asked Walters what he should do. Dick told him to calm down and to consider the
                    President's letter at greater length; it was important not to reach any hasty
                    decisions. He told Mobutu that Reagan's letter was really in his and Zaire's
                    best interests. Walters and Mobutu had had a long relationship; they were both
                    very flamboyant, raconteurs, schemers; so they got along well.</p>
                <p>About three weeks later, Mobutu decided that he could accept Reagan's conditions.
                    I think that initially he was really upset by Reagan's letter. He had a number
                    of American Republican friends and I am sure he genuinely felt that he would be
                    treated “better” by Reagan than he had by Carter. He also understood that Reagan
                    was much more a Cold War “hawk”; he viewed Carter as being obsessed by human
                    rights and thought that the new Republican administration would be more
                    favorable to him in the Cold War context. For Mobutu, human rights policy just
                    seemed to be supportive of anti-Mobutu revolutionaries. He saw Reagan's election
                    as a return to the Nixon period when Zaire was viewed as part of U.S.' strategic
                    policy against the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>There is an anecdote that I would like to recount that illustrates Mobutu's and
                    Zairean views of U.S. Presidents. We hosted an election night party in 1980 at a
                    Kinshasa hotel. We took a secret straw poll among the guests - and there were
                    lots, including the Foreign Minister. As you will recall, it was a close
                    election and Reagan won by a slim margin. I went to bed about 3 a.m. only to be
                    awakened about three hours later by a phone call from someone from Mobutu's
                    entourage telling me that the President of Zaire wished to host a celebration
                    breakfast in honor of the new U.S. President. I was to be at the palace in
                    twenty minutes. I immediately got up - in somewhat less than a happy frame of
                    mind. But I got to the palace on time and was a guest at a wonderful breakfast.
                    Mobutu went on at great length on how much better his relationship with the U.S.
                    was going to be now that pesky Carter was gone. He added that all Zaireans
                    favored Reagan. I told him that his view was very interesting because it was
                    quite inconsistent with the straw poll that we had taken the night before at our
                    election party - in fact, 90% of the votes had been cast for Carter. Mobutu
                    scowled and said: “If I had them in the stadium for five minutes, they would
                    change their minds!” I laughed and said that he was probably right. The Foreign
                    Minister, who also attended the breakfast, looked considerably out of sorts. But
                    I think that breakfast was a good clue about Mobutu's expectations - which is
                    undoubtedly one of the reasons he reacted so strongly when he received Reagan's
                    letter as delivered by Walters.</p>
                <p>I think that Mobutu framed his view of Republican administrations from his
                    experiences during the Nixon period. He also was in touch with American
                    lobbyists who were on his payroll and were quite conservative as were the
                    American businessmen he came in touch with. There were a few who came to
                    Kinshasa and saw Mobutu privately, but that was a rare occasion.</p>
                <p>This trucks episode and the Walters' meeting, both of which I have described
                    earlier, really irritated Mobutu no end. By 1982, Mobutu's irritation at me and
                    the U.S. was such that he issued instructions that he didn't want anyone to talk
                    to me. He actually sent his intelligence chief to Washington to talk to Casey -
                    the CIA Director - to have me recalled. That was an illustration of Mobutu's
                    views on how the U.S. government was run. Fortunately, Carlucci, although by
                    this time he had become the Deputy Secretary of Defense, knew about my clashes
                    with Mobutu; he talked to [Casper] Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, Casey
                    and [Secretary of State Al] Haig and told them that Oakley was just doing what
                    he was instructed to do. He told them that I was a seasoned diplomat and
                    certainly not the first ambassador that Mobutu had tried to throw out (he had
                    been successful with Mac Godley and Dean Hinton a few years earlier - both were
                    recalled for carrying out their instructions). Carlucci said that the U.S. could
                    not afford to have Mobutu try to get every ambassador who does his job recalled.
                    The upshot of this Mobutu effort was that Dick Walters came back to Kinshasa to
                    tell Mobutu that I would not be recalled. Once again, I was told that Mobutu
                    burst into tears and asked: “Do I have to keep him forever?” Walters said: “No,
                    but he is not leaving now!”</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>We did manage to keep our assistance and Peace Corps programs going - but barely.
                    At one point, Mobutu asked that the Peace Corps program be terminated because he
                    was convinced that volunteers had been providing information to Congressmen
                    Solarz and Volpe. This information was being used in Congressional hearings.
                    Both legislators were very critical of Mobutu and Zaire and wanted our
                    assistance programs terminated. We saved the Peace Corps program through the
                    fortuitous visit of Jeane Kirkpatrick, then our Ambassador to the UN, along with
                    Elizabeth Dole and Ursula Meese. They were on an official tour of Africa and
                    stopped in Kinshasa. It was a very useful trip in general and for us especially.
                    Mobutu fell all over Kirkpatrick and vice-versa, because she saw Mobutu as the
                    personification of a pro-western autocrat - as opposed to a Soviet sponsored
                    dictator - and this was the gist of an article she had written which Reagan
                    liked. She and Mobutu got along very well and he convinced Kirkpatrick that I
                    was really part of the Carter human rights cabal and therefore not only wrong,
                    but also not to be trusted. However, I managed to convince Kirkpatrick that it
                    was neither in Mobutu's or in the U.S.' interest to have him close the Peace
                    Corps program. She managed to get Mobutu to change his mind.</p>
                <p>Later, when I returned to the NSC, I discovered a letter that Kirkpatrick had
                    written to President Reagan after her trip to Africa recommending that I be
                    recalled. But since that had already been decided, as I have described earlier,
                    through Carlucci's intervention, nothing was done about her recommendation.</p>
                <p>I thought that it was in our interest to maintain both a modest economic
                    assistance program and the Peace Corps. The latter had a good program. I have
                    recently been asked how I managed an embassy. I said that I felt it important
                    that all elements of an embassy work together, but that that was sometimes
                    easier said than done. I mentioned that in Zaire I would bring the AID director
                    and the Peace Corps Director together in my office. We would meet each week, at
                    least once. It took me six months before the two would communicate with each
                    other outside this weekly meeting; each was going off in his own direction.
                    Ultimately, we managed to get four Peace Corps volunteers in one town to work on
                    some local fish ponds with technical support from AID. The number of ponds
                    increased in two years from 200 to 5,000. That provided the town with new
                    business and a food supply. It is possible to accomplish something when all pull
                    in the same direction. The Peace Corps worked in Zaire with the local
                    population, which was exactly what needed to be done, but they needed some
                    technical support.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I think Mobutu resented the efforts of the volunteers because in some respect
                    they made him look bad, in the same way the missionaries made the government
                    look bad because they also worked with the local populations. But Mobutu's
                    unhappiness could not be a guiding principle for us. I did try to make sure that
                    the volunteers kept within acceptable political boundaries - no fiery speeches
                    about dictatorship. They had a very good training center in East Zaire for all
                    of French speaking Africa. I think the Peace Corps training was tough; it
                    emphasized the need for the volunteers not to be too radical, too idealistic,
                    not to worry about the political situation they found, but to focus on their
                    jobs. About thirty percent of the volunteers were weeded out during this
                    training - they were primarily those who might have been psychologically weak -
                    unable to stand the strains and pressure they would have to endure. One of the
                    objectives of the vigorous training program was to identify early and weed out
                    those who might not be able to meet the challenges; that was a very big plus.
                    But the Peace Corps had a lot of synergy. When we got them to work with AID and
                    the missionaries, they were very effective; they provided low level medical
                    assistance, farming assistance, some English training, etc., as well as fish
                    ponds. It was a great program in Zaire, as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>Zaire was the focus of considerable Congressional interest in the 1979-1982
                    period - almost all of it negative. While I was there, Nguza Karl-i-Bond, who
                    had been imprisoned earlier and released, and then had become the Foreign
                    Minister before becoming the Prime Minister, left Zaire suddenly with his wife
                    and family and all of his earthly belongings. He flew to Brussels because he was
                    afraid that Mobutu was planning to imprison him again, or worse. He just picked
                    up and left, leaving a furious Mobutu who could not understand how someone like
                    that could leave his country unimpeded with family and furniture. His
                    intelligence services were shaken up. So Nguza became Mobutu's enemy number one.
                    [Representative] Solarz held several hearings during which Nguza attacked the
                    regime, building pressure on Mobutu. I think he was being subsidized by some
                    smaller Belgian businessmen who had been barred from doing business in Zaire.
                    They hoped that through Nguza, they could overthrow Mobutu and reestablish
                    themselves as the premier businessmen in Kinshasa. However, after three years,
                    Nguza found that his subsidies had dried up because he was obviously not meeting
                    his supporters' aspirations. It became clear to his financiers that he would not
                    be able to dislodge Mobutu. After the third year, he came crawling back to Zaire
                    to beg for a job. Mobutu appointed Nguza as his Ambassador to Washington,
                    forcing him to become Zaire's spokesman and defender in Congress, including
                    Solarz and Volpe. He then had to explain that Mobutu was a good President and
                    had to reverse his previous positions. That was the way Mobutu worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>We had some visitors while I was in Zaire, including a couple of Congressional
                    delegations. There were two special missions that I remember especially. The
                    first delegation came very privately led by Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense
                    Minister, in 1981. Mobutu was having trouble with his palace guard, which was
                    primarily staffed by his fellow tribesmen - handpicked. He found that personal
                    items were disappearing in the palace - one of his leopard skin caps, his cane,
                    etc. That upset him greatly because he was afraid that these were signs of a
                    plot being planned - witchcraft or assassination. He asked us whether we could
                    provide him some bodyguards and whether we would train his bodyguards - all to
                    be done by the CIA. I said “No.” Our Station Chief may have thought it might
                    provide him an opportunity to infiltrate the palace, but for many reasons, I
                    didn't think that we wanted to be seen as that close to Mobutu. Washington
                    agreed; it was not the U.S. government's business to do things like that.</p>
                <p>I learned later that the Israelis, on the other hand, having heard of Mobutu's
                    interests, despatched Sharon to see Mobutu. Sharon told Mobutu that the Israelis
                    were prepared to train his bodyguard - they knew how to do that well. He also
                    added that Mobutu should never have turned to the U.S. in the first place,
                    because even if we had agreed, we had been shown to be ineffective. After all,
                    our closest allies in Africa, Presidents Sadat and Tolbert of Egypt and Liberia,
                    had just been assassinated. That showed that we did not know how to protect our
                    friends. The Israelis were prepared to provide trainers and in addition, Israel
                    would make an effort to change U.S. views of Zaire by primarily initiating a
                    lobbying effort in Congress. They also promised to see whether it would be
                    possible to increase private investment in Zaire. In return, all the Israelis
                    wanted was for Zaire to be the first black African state to resume diplomatic
                    relations with Israel. And that is exactly what happened. Mobutu thought it was
                    a good deal; he resumed diplomatic relations with Israel, who provided trainers
                    for his palace guard.</p>
                <p>The Israeli Prime Minister wrote a memorandum to President Reagan suggesting that
                    the U.S. should do more for Zaire. The White House did have conversations with
                    Solarz and Volpe, who refused to budge. A few months later, an American business
                    delegation, headed by the CEO of K-Mart came. We learned about it by accident;
                    Washington had not been advised. It had all been arranged through the Israelis.
                    I did go to the airport to meet the delegation and brought them back to the
                    Embassy in my car. During the trip into town, I asked the CEO of K-Mart whether
                    he would like to have an Embassy briefing. He readily agreed. So we gave him a
                    quick one; at the end I asked whether the American businessmen planned to invest
                    in Zaire. He looked at me and said: “Are you crazy? We are not fools! But the
                    Israeli Prime Minister asked us to visit Zaire to indicate interest; so we
                    came.” So as far as the U.S. was concerned, nothing changed because the Israelis
                    picked up Zaire's cudgels. It is true that Israel and Zaire resumed diplomatic
                    relations and that Mobutu got trainers for his palace guard, but that was all. I
                    think this story tells you something about the way the Israelis and Mobutu
                    operated; I found it very interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>The three most influential countries in Zaire were the French, the Belgians and
                    ourselves. I had very good relations with both the French and Belgian
                    ambassadors; we were very polite with each other. We worked with the French to
                    deliver military material to Chad when it was under pressure from Libya, using
                    the Zairean army as sort of a “fig leaf.” We flew the material into Zaire in our
                    transports; the French, who had a military presence in Chad, made sure that our
                    deliveries were not stolen. We followed the same practice when these supplies
                    were re-shipped to Chad using our planes and the French soldiers to guard the
                    shipments. It took a while to work out all the details; most of the work was
                    done in Kinshasa, but it was a successful operation. I think there were many
                    skeptics who were surprised that France and the U.S. could cooperate so well in
                    the middle of French Africa.</p>
                <p>It was somewhat surprising how well we did get along with the French who after
                    all were our main competitors. They were suspicious of us because they viewed us
                    as potential replacements for them in Africa. They also were competitors with
                    the Belgians for the mineral resources of Zaire. The Belgians already had a good
                    foothold in the mines, but there were several American and French companies who
                    also wanted a piece of the action. The commercial rivalry did not interfere with
                    the good working relationships the three ambassadors had in Kinshasa. The
                    diplomatic community included Tunisian, Egyptians, Canadians, Chinese. The
                    latter were represented by an ambassador who later headed the Chinese population
                    program until he died of a heart attack. The Canadian Ambassador, Raymond
                    Chretien, is now his country's emissary to Washington. The Belgian Ambassador
                    was a wonderful man - educated in the U.S.; he was the one whom I mentioned
                    before who explained the Belgian views on “conflict of interest” to me.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were always ups and downs driven by Mobutu's relations with each
                    country. When his relations with us and the Belgians soured, he would make an
                    extra effort to have good relations with the French. If his relations with the
                    France deteriorated, then his relations with Belgium would improve; it was a
                    constant see-saw. He didn't want to have both countries angry at him at the same
                    time. The only area where we found cooperation difficult was in the bilateral
                    assistance area. I mentioned how well we worked with the IMF and the World Bank.
                    Cooperation with the Belgians was a little more difficult because they had so
                    many special interests. Their Ambassador was very frustrated, but we finally
                    agreed that the Belgian situation was somewhat analogous to what we had seen
                    with the U.S. particularly between the two wars in Central Americ- the “Banana
                    Republics” - and the Caribbean when the American corporations were calling the
                    shots - not the State Department or the ambassadors. He told me that there was
                    very little he could do about certain Belgian policies because they were being
                    set by the business community and not the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>I didn't have to do a lot of table pounding when it came to Zaire'vote in the UN
                    because it tended to vote with the West.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>We had a lot of American Protestant missionaries in Zaire. There were many
                    Belgian Catholic missionaries. I spent a lot of time traveling around the
                    country and I made it a point to talk to them as often as I could. I encouraged
                    them and worked with them. As I said, the Peace Corps worked closely with them.
                    They did not put much pressure on me on the question of human rights. They were
                    devoted to the welfare of their congregations.</p>
                <p>I was always a church goer. Soon after our arrival in Kinshasa, my wife and I
                    decided that we would attend a Zairean Protestant church. The music was
                    wonderful; we liked the pastor, Dr. Kimbawa. We did not realize that we had
                    entered into a very politically sensitive area. It turned out that Mobutu, some
                    years earlier, had decided that in order to counter the Catholics, who were led
                    by a cardinal who disapproved of him, he would create a protestant “archbishop”.
                    The Cardinal - who was still there in 1979 and is still there today was regarded
                    as Mobutu's most feared critic, although the Pope limited him in his involvement
                    in active politics - a limitation still imposed today making the Cardinal less
                    of a player than he might otherwise have been. Both the Zairean and Belgian
                    Catholic leadership were very critical of Mobutu - his life style, the
                    corruption, etc. The Church was an independent force in Zaire, as it is in most
                    countries - the chief of state and the government have no sway over the Catholic
                    Church and its leadership. To counter the power of the Catholic Church, Mobutu
                    decided to get behind a Protestant block of churches. He named someone to head
                    all of the Protestant churches in Zaire. That didn't go over very well with the
                    Protestants. So Mobutu decided on a different approach; he focused on getting a
                    new pastor for the church I was attending. One Sunday, he sent one of his
                    functionaries to the church to announce the name of the new pastor he had
                    chosen. The church committee didn't accept that; that was not the way their
                    pastors had ever been chosen and they were not going to be a party to a new
                    system. That put me square in the middle of a confrontation between the church
                    and Mobutu. I decided that I would not withdraw as a congregant, but stick with
                    my fellow parishioners. I became a real cause celebre. After a while, Mobutu's
                    people approached the church's landlord; they made a deal and the church was
                    padlocked. So every Sunday, we would pray in the courtyard of the church. After
                    a few more weeks of that, the gates to the land on which the church stood, were
                    closed. So people prayed outside the gates, alongside the road. It just so
                    happened that on the Sunday after, I did not attend services. But Mobutu sent
                    some of his goons to the gates and they began to beat up people, including
                    another white parishioner whom they undoubtedly mistook for me. Then everybody
                    got together and took up a collection - enough to construct a new church. We all
                    prayed in the skeleton of the new church on Christmas eve; the next morning,
                    before dawn, bulldozers showed up and flattened the church. After that, we
                    joined a Catholic church, which welcomed us as members of its congregation.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I think in some respects, my presence at that Protestant church may have
                    contributed to its demise. I have no doubt that some people whispered into
                    Mobutu's ear that the U.S. was using the church to plot against him. It was a
                    very tough decision for me whether to leave that Protestant congregation, but in
                    the end I decided to stick with it. I think perhaps had I left the church
                    earlier, the second church building might not have been destroyed. But I decided
                    that I was not going to be driven out by some goons in the exercise of my
                    religious traditions and beliefs. After all, all I was doing was worshiping; I
                    certainly was not involved in any political activity or plot against Mobutu.</p>
                <p>On another note, I found it very interesting to watch Catholic services, during
                    which priests walked in the aisles wearing leopard skins and ostrich plumes. The
                    services were tailored to use native music. It is a whole different experience
                    which I found riveting. It is the organized church that gives people any hope
                    for the future of Zaire and many other African states. I found the same syndrome
                    in some Islamic countries; when people are in such poverty-stricken situation,
                    they must find something to believe in. As was true in the European Dark Ages,
                    that something is the Church - regardless of denomination. We used to have
                    contacts with the Cardinal. He was a good analyst of the Zairean political
                    situation. As in many other situation, the Church had a good feel for the
                    sentiments of the people, but the Cardinal was very careful in his public
                    pronouncements. In Zaire, it was the Cardinal who organized a political
                    convention some years ago. But as I mentioned earlier, he was under severe
                    guidance from the Vatican. We still see him when he comes to the US, which is
                    about every six months or so. So we are quite aware now as we were then of the
                    political winds in Zaire and the restrictions under which the Cardinal operated.
                    It should be remembered that Mobutu married his mistress the night before the
                    Pope paid a visit to Zaire - he didn't want to meet the Pope without having
                    married his mistress - he didn't want to be in “sin”. The Cardinal, who had to
                    officiate at the ceremony was not a happy man, but had no choice with the Pope
                    arriving the next day. It was quite an event attended by one million people. I
                    have never seen such a huge crowd.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I think it would almost have been impossible for any American
                    ambassador to avoid Mobutu's wrath during the 1979-82 period. There were
                    economic issues, human rights issues. In addition to my decisions to cut off his
                    CIA channel, I was not going to be someone that Mobutu could just roll over. So
                    the bad feeling that he had for me was not precipitated by any one event; it
                    came from a series of decision that we made on a variety of subjects. He was
                    particularly upset - and with some justification blamed me - for demanding
                    specific actions on his part before he would receive his invitation to visit
                    President Reagan. He expected a more favorable welcome and decided to blame me
                    for making demands on him. It is true that Lannon Walker and I worked out this
                    strategy, but it is also true that it was approved by the senior officials of
                    our government.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>When I left Zaire in 1982, I did not expect Mobutu to fall anytime soon. So I am
                    not surprised that here in late 1996, he is still around. I have an axiom: an
                    African chief of state who comes to power - regardless how he came to power - if
                    he can come through his first three years in office unscathed, he can then rule
                    indefinitely so long as he pays careful attention to his security forces. If he
                    can last the first three years, that means he has learned all the political hot
                    buttons of the local scene and is able to manipulate the various power centers -
                    military, tribal, etc. After that, his only danger comes from his
                    security/military forces. He must maintain their allegiance; pay very careful
                    attention to them; stroke them, etc. It doesn't have to be all of the armed
                    forces; in Zaire, for example, Mobutu only had to pay attention to his palace
                    guards and the intelligence services. He had to make sure that the rest of the
                    military never gained enough strength to be a potential destabilizing force; it
                    was the palace guards that had to have all the military equipment. He had in one
                    way or another to insure his control over his palace guard and the intelligence
                    services. As I said my axiom is that any African leader that lasts for three
                    years will be able to manipulate the political forces in his country. I first
                    developed that thought when serving in the Ivory Coast; I think the axiom was
                    true then as it is today - witness Eyadema in Togo who has been in power as long
                    as Mobutu. They were both Army sergeants who engineered in the assassination of
                    a chief of state and took power. I must say that assassinations are rare in
                    Africa and I don't think that is the way Mobutu will end his rule.</p>
                <p>I personally left Zaire laughing because the night before my departure, Mobutu
                    sent one of his minions to tell me that the President wanted to give me the
                    “Order of the Leopard” the next day. It was the country's highest honor. I
                    opined that this gesture seemed very odd since in the last six months every
                    Zairean had been instructed not to talk to me - and only the head of the Central
                    Bank disobeyed orders and talked to me. I said that I guessed that Mobutu
                    thought that in bestowing me this honor, I would be in a good frame of mind and
                    thereby refrain from expressing any negative comments about him. I did accept
                    the “Order” but I could barely contain my laughter. I promised to give it to
                    Dick Walters who had never received one, but I haven't done that yet. When I
                    left, I didn't have much hope for Zaire's future. Mobutu, in a tactic many other
                    leaders have used, kept repeating: “If you think I am bad, just wait till you
                    see my successors. Just remember how bad it was before I became President.” It
                    was true that in 1963, the country was in midst of a ruinous civil war, anarchy,
                    chaos. He did provide stability. I don't think Mobutu is very different from
                    many tyrants; he didn't like to have [potential] successors or strong
                    vice-presidents or prime ministers. Any strong political leader is competition
                    and a possible source for instability. Mobutu has always been very skillful in
                    making sure that no competitor would become viable; he would get rid of anyone
                    who might have any aspirations. I earlier discussed the Minister of Agriculture;
                    not only was he sabotaged by his colleagues, but eventually Mobutu shipped him
                    out of the country as Ambassador to Japan. Most Zairean embassies do not get
                    paid; they usually have to live off the sale of visas or other documents to
                    survive - that is true in the U.S. even today. But the Minister outwitted his
                    government; when he got to Tokyo, he sold the Embassy, rented it back and lived
                    off the proceeds from that sale - putting the revenues into his own personal
                    bank account.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>I think Zaire today is still a huge mess, but we really don't care that much.
                    Mobutu has found a way to make some impact by using the Burundi-Rwanda conflict
                    very cleverly. He insists that he is the only person who can bring peace to
                    these two countries; of course, he is not trying to resolve the issues; he is in
                    fact deliberately exacerbating the situation. I think the White House was
                    considering sending Tony Lake to see Mobutu to seek his intervention in the
                    Burundi-Rwanda conflict; I think Mobutu would pluck him naked in no time. Mobutu
                    is very clever; there are some American emissaries who even think he walks on
                    water.</p>
                <p>I found my last six months in Zaire very difficult since no senior government
                    official would talk to me. But we kept plugging away using staff members to
                    carry messages. I did not give any indication that I was disturbed by Mobutu's
                    edict. I did not change our operations. During this period I found out that the
                    Station Chief had talked to Mobutu without my permission. I immediately cabled
                    Washington reporting this violation of my instructions. Fortunately, soon
                    thereafter, in a normal change of personnel we got a new Station Chief, who was
                    a great improvement. He was the one who tipped me off that the Zairean
                    intelligence chief was being despatched to Washington to try to get me recalled.
                    The last six months were frustrating and I understood that we could not make
                    much progress in Zaire under those circumstances, but there were larger
                    principles involved, such as not allowing the U.S. to bow to this dictator. I
                    finally left in early summer of 1982, only about four months shy of a three year
                    anniversary.</p>
                <p>When I left Zaire, I was not at all sure what my next assignment would be. I
                    returned to Washington without an onward assignment. The White House and the
                    State Department had stood by me, but they were not at all happy with what had
                    transpired in Kinshasa. Jeane Kirkpatrick, as I indicated earlier, had suggested
                    my transfer and she did have some influence. So while not giving in to Mobutu
                    about my recall, I was not Washington's favorite ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in 1982, you were assigned to Somalia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That is right. That job came suddenly shortly after I returned from Zaire
                    and Chet Crocker and Frank Wisner thought that that would be a good assignment
                    for me. They must have thought that my experiences in Zaire would be good
                    reparation for Mogadishu. And that is where I went.</p>
                <p>The White House went along with that - it would not have sent me to a good
                    European post, but Somalia must have seemed acceptable to them. They probably
                    considered that I had been in some very tough spots before and therefore should
                    be able to do a good job in Somalia. As a matter of fact, I think it probably
                    worked well; it was like moving from the major leagues - Mobutu - to a AAA minor
                    league club - Siad Barre - or from Zaire to Somalia.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>In fact, there were some similarities. Both countries were run by dictators -
                    former Army men - who really didn't give a damn about their people and were
                    solely interested in their personal aggrandizement - power and money. They both
                    used the Cold War to obtain U.S. support. Somalia, like Zaire, was viewed by the
                    U.S. through the prism of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>I knew almost nothing about Somalia when I went there. No one in Washington knew
                    much about that country. Somehow both we and the Soviets had conned ourselves
                    into believing that the Horn of Africa was of great strategic importance. I
                    think that after a few years, both countries recognized the folly of their
                    conventional wisdom. But in 1982, we still viewed that part of the world as
                    being strategically vital to U.S. national security interests. We had
                    established several large military bases to protect the Indian Ocean and the
                    Middle East - Brzezinki's “Arc of Crisis”. We built some; we tried to rehab
                    some, like the old Soviet base in Berbera. In fact, we traded allies with the
                    Soviets. They had been the predominant force in Somalia, providing large amounts
                    of economic and military assistance. Their generals were advising the Somalis in
                    their war with Ethiopia. We on the other hand were Ethiopia's major supporter.
                    Then, almost overnight, the same Soviet generals were advising Ethiopia on how
                    to defeat Somalia's offensive deep into the Ogaden, and Soviet planes were
                    flying in Cuban troops and heavy weapons to help Ethiopia. The Somali offensive
                    was totally destroyed. The Soviets were kicked out of Somalia, but became
                    dominant in Ethiopia. The U.S. started assisting Somalia.</p>
                <p>Personally, I had no reason at the time to challenge the conventional wisdom
                    about the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa. I wasn't a fiery supporter
                    of the thesis, but I didn't oppose it either. By 1982, Reg Bartholomew had
                    secured base rights for us at Berbera, which the Soviets had occupied. During my
                    tour, that base was renovated - both the port and the airbase. We held some
                    maneuvers there - amphibious landings. It soon became evident that CENTCOM [The
                    Pentagon's Central Command] would not be using the base very much because
                    improved airlift capability made it unnecessary. The U.S. Air Force could fly
                    directly from Egypt into the Gulf without needing to land in Berbera. But at the
                    time we secured the base rights, we didn't know that we would have so extended
                    the reach of our aircraft. By the time I got to Somalia, it was pretty clear
                    that neither the airfield nor the port would be used very much.</p>
                <p>Despite the concern of some American military officers, I didn't see much
                    evidence of Soviet efforts to interdict shipping in the Gulf of Aden or the Red
                    Sea. Nevertheless, Somalia became part of the Cold War strategy - the same
                    syndrome that applied to Zaire. In retrospect, by 1986, it was obvious to me
                    that both we and the Soviets had been mistaken about the strategic importance of
                    the Horn of Africa. In 1987, we held a meeting with the Soviets to discuss
                    regional issues in Geneva. Dick Murphy, then Assistant Secretary for NEA, Chet
                    Crocker, Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, and I were there. We talked to
                    the Soviet Middle East and Africa experts about the Horn and we all agreed at
                    our level that from that point on, both the U.S. and the USSR should not regard
                    the Horn of Africa as an area of strategic importance, and that both the U.S.
                    and the Soviet Union had spent a lot of time and effort in that part of the
                    world with very few, if any, benefits. It took a while for this to sink in at
                    the policy level, if it ever did.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>We did manage in the 1982-84 period to avoid paying a political price for the use
                    of the bases. Siad Barre kept trying to involve us more deeply in Somali affairs
                    - i.e. support for his regime - , but we resisted his offers to use Berbera as
                    the advance headquarters for CENTCOM. We were not about to give him greater
                    support, which would have been the clearly implicit quid pro quo for use of
                    Berbera as CENTCOM headquarters. I will tell you later about my struggles with
                    Siad Barre on economic issues - somewhat comparable to my debates with Mobutu.
                    We did provide some modest military assistance, primarily to give Somalia some
                    defense against the raids that were being mounted from the Ogaden in Ethiopia.
                    Those raids were a threat and conducted by Somali rebels and Ethiopian military,
                    with Soviet support. We used that assistance also in an effort to move the
                    Somali Army in the right political direction - e.g. economic reforms and human
                    rights. Hersi Morgan, Siad Barre's son-in-law - later known as the “butcher of
                    Hargeysa” - was someone I worked with. But we did not pay a political price to
                    Siad Barre for the bases. That became quite clear when I returned to Somalia in
                    1992; the Somalis did not hold the U.S. responsible for the Barre regime, and
                    was aware of my sharp disputes with Siad Barre about misbehavior of some of his
                    guards.</p>
                <p>By the time I arrived in Somalia, our relationship with Ethiopia had soured
                    because of President Mengistu's deplorable human rights record. That opened the
                    way for the Soviets to shift their support from small Somalia to a larger and
                    more strategically located Ethiopia. So they changed sides and then we did by
                    becoming Somalia's patron. I remember talking to some Somali generals who told
                    me that during the war in Ogaden they could monitor Ethiopian broadcasts and
                    hear the voices of the same Soviet advisors who only a few weeks earlier had
                    been advising them, the Somalis.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>By 1982, our military and economic assistance programs in Somalia were growing.
                    The Embassy staff was still small - about one-third of that in Zaire. By the
                    time I left, the Embassy probably doubled in size. The growth - almost all of it
                    for assistance programs - was not a management problem. It worked reasonably
                    well. If we had any major problems it was with American personnel hired on
                    contract; they were independent of our direct control. Some were under the
                    general supervision of the Embassy's Defense Representative's Office, which grew
                    considerably during my tour, others were working for AID. So both the staffs
                    working on military and economic assistance grew. From a management point of
                    view, what I did find when I arrived in Mogadishu was a large cleavage among the
                    various elements of the Embassy. The economic assistance and military assistance
                    teams hardly ever talked to each other. By the time I finished my tour, I was
                    pleased by the close working relationships that our economic assistance, our
                    military assistance and the State Department components of the Embassy had
                    established. One of my management objectives as a chief of mission has always
                    been to ensure that the various U.S. programs and elements are mutually
                    reinforcing. If we use all of our tools toward common goals, we get much more
                    leverage, particularly from people like Mobutu and Siad Barre. We also avoid
                    having one agency played off against another.The quality of the staff improved
                    during my tour. The Department found me a good political officer - Lynn Scensey
                    and John Hirsch were excellent DCMs. Unlike Zaire, which was an attractive
                    assignment for African experts, Somalia was not.</p>
                <p>As I suggested, Somalia increasingly was viewed at that time as a “front line”
                    state in the Cold War. Our military insisted that because many of our military
                    aircraft could not fly without refueling into the Gulf and the Indian Ocean, it
                    needed a base in Somalia. The same view was held by the Navy; it had to have a
                    port. Somehow, Somalia became critical to our support first of the Shah and then
                    after he was overthrown, our support for the Gulf and Afghanistan. The case was
                    made that unless we could provide adequate military force, the Gulf oil supplies
                    were in jeopardy. I accepted these premises when I went to Somalia, although I
                    was not totally convinced by the arguments made by our military.</p>
                <p>I had not forgotten that Mobutu at one stage had offered us a base at Kamina - a
                    large air base originally built by the Belgians which was later used frequently
                    to support Savimbi and UNITA in Angola. When I asked him why he thought that
                    might be of interest to us, he said that it would be important for NATO
                    operations. I told him that I didn't think that NATO really needed a base in the
                    middle of Zaire. It was clear to me that Mobutu's offer had nothing to do with
                    NATO; it was just a further effort on his part to squeeze additional support out
                    of us. When he noticed my skepticism, he said that perhaps the base could be
                    used as a staging area for operations in the Indian Ocean. That didn't make much
                    sense to me either; why would we want to stop in the middle of Zaire on the way
                    to Somalia or Kenya or Djibouti when we could ship the material directly by sea?
                    At that stage, he became quite angry and told me that I obviously knew nothing
                    about military strategy.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>The same syndrome reappeared in Somalia. Siad Barre wanted us to open an advance
                    headquarters of CENTCOM, which had just been created shortly before I went to
                    Somalia. I kept saying that it was not needed. Siad Barre's motives were the
                    same as Mobutu's: to tie the U.S. to him. Siad Barre insisted that he could
                    provide all the headquarter's needs; I told him that we didn't need to move it
                    out of Florida. In addition to the unnecessary expense that would be involved, I
                    was not that comfortable with our total strategy and I thought it was not at all
                    desirable for us to put more of our eggs in Siad Barre's basket. Siad Barre's
                    sole interest in us was as a way of keeping himself in power and fending off his
                    domestic enemies as well as the Ethiopians. They were a constant problem in the
                    Ogaden - the Ethiopia-Somalia border area. Not only were the Ethiopians - with
                    Soviet support - a threat to Somalia from that region, but a number of anti-Siad
                    Barre Somali factions operated from the Ogaden. Those factions, supported by the
                    Ethiopians, were constantly trying to infiltrate Somalia in an effort to
                    overthrow Siad Barre. He had not forgotten that the Ethiopians, assisted by
                    Cubans, had beaten the Somalis badly a few years earlier. At that time
                    Brzezinski had wanted us to intervene, but Carter refused to do so. I think some
                    of Siad Barre's fears were overblown; I did not believe that there would be any
                    major Ethiopian invasion. But there were occasional Ethiopian Army small scale
                    raids, although the soldiers were disguised as guerrillas. The Somali military
                    was not particularly effective; its command structure was lacking. Morgan, who
                    had attended the Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, was much
                    more adept at pulling disparate elements of the Somali military together on the
                    Ethiopian borders than any of the officers trained by the Soviets. Later on, his
                    small war-lord force was much better disciplined and trained than the
                    others.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, CENTCOM had a team in northern Somalia looking for areas for
                    amphibious landings - under operation “Bright Star (an annual U.S.-Egypt joint
                    military exercise).” The team had landed on the Berbera airstrip in a C-130. The
                    field was overflown by two planes, which the team reported were Soviet MiGs. All
                    the U.S. military scrambled. It turned out that the planes were actually U.S.
                    F-14s from an aircraft carrier, flying photo recon over the beaches. Of course,
                    we had never been informed that this would happen. The Somalis tried to fire
                    their SAM missiles, but they never launched. They blew up on their launching
                    pads. But our people on the ground were sure that the two planes were Soviet
                    fighters which had taken off from some Ethiopian airfield. There was a lot of
                    tension and misunderstanding in Somalia, fueled by the Cold War.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>We did provide some limited military assistance to Somalia. The material was
                    primarily APCs [armored personnel carriers] and TOW missiles (anti tank
                    weapons). We also provided assistance to help the Somalis get their Soviet
                    equipment operating again. But we never provided major systems - aircraft,
                    artillery, etc. We did fly P-23s out of Berbera for Indian Ocean Gulf
                    surveillance purposes. I think what we provided was a good use of resources. It
                    discouraged the Ethiopians - and their Cuban and Soviet supporters. It didn't
                    bring a complete halt to the skirmishes on the Ethiopian-Somalia border, but I
                    think it may have prevented the outbreak of any large-scale conflicts. The
                    Somalis used our equipment well; it was not too sophisticated for that country's
                    military forces. We did not provide any offensive capability, beyond some old
                    Italian tanks which looked very good on the parade ground, but could never have
                    made it to the front. In fact, we had to bring in a special team of Army
                    mechanics to work on them enough to get them to and through the national day
                    parade. Not everyone [in our government] agreed to giving tanks to the Somalis,
                    but they were in such a state, that they hardly fitted the description of
                    military hardware.</p>
                <p>What we did provide satisfied our military requirements because we obtained
                    rights to use of military facilities in Somalia - which was limited by the rigor
                    of living in Somalia and a base for our long-range aircraft. We were not
                    interested in establishing a large U.S. military presence. In the final
                    analysis, the Navy barely ever used Berbera; it found that Djibouti and Mombasa
                    [in Kenya] were much more useful because our sailors could actually take shore
                    leave in those ports; there was no point in going ashore in Berbera.</p>
                <p>On economic assistance, I think we had some good programs. We worked hard on
                    rural areas, trying to improve agriculture, animal husbandry and water supplies.
                    We had some very good contractors working in those projects. As I said earlier,
                    one of my principal goals was to pull everyone together. I chaired a meeting at
                    the American Club where the Embassy staff showed considerable resistance to
                    having contractors use the Club. I think they would have objected also to a U.S.
                    military presence, but that they knew was beyond their scope. The staff didn't
                    understand why the contractors, who were being paid “so much money,” needed to
                    have access to the Club. My answer was very simple: “They are Americans.” We
                    took three votes on the question of Club membership. The first two votes were
                    negative on permitting contractors to join; I explained my rationale to the
                    membership again. On the third vote, by a very slim majority, the membership
                    agreed to let contractors join the Club. Eventually the contractors went to work
                    and built the Club an Olympic-size swimming pool. By that time, all American
                    businessmen were allowed to join. They provided the pipe and cement and funds
                    for other work; the contractors supplied the labor and pretty soon we had this
                    large pool. I thought that was a real plus. Even those members who had been
                    opposed to allowing non-official Americans to join the Club were pleased and
                    began to see the advantage of working together.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I think we did have an impact on Somalia's economic scene. Significant changes
                    were made in economic policies which unfortunately were reversed when Siad Barre
                    became so suspicious over the marked increase in the wealth of the northern
                    clans, as I will mention. When Siad Barre reversed himself, that was the
                    beginning of Somalia's long decline; Siad Barre's repressive measures started
                    the civil war. Until that reversal, I was satisfied that progress was being made
                    on the economic front. In the period 1982-84, Somalia was heading in the right
                    direction. But it was only a couple of years later that Siad Barre changed
                    course.</p>
                <p>Human rights were another matter. I think the best we were able to do was to
                    prevent them from getting any worse, although this situation also deteriorated
                    severely in the late 1980s. I think we need to accept that “human rights” was
                    not a phrase that was easily understood by the Somalis. It didn't fit into their
                    clan culture. I think it is also true that in the 1982-84 period, the phrase was
                    not as much a part of the international culture as it has become in more recent
                    years. I have found it interesting to watch the ever increasing importance of
                    “human rights.” There are still some nations that take issue with us on the
                    imposition of an international standard of “human rights”, but there is
                    certainly considerable more awareness in the international community of that
                    standard now than there used to be.</p>

                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>My view of counter-terrorism was that it was one of a varying number of issues
                    that we had with different countries and a number of varying interests that the
                    U.S. needed to pursue. I felt that it was important to examine all the issues
                    and interests in order to maintain some perspective on the terrorist threat.
                    Some people would be critical of my not being sufficiently dedicated to
                    counter-terrorism, not being single-minded in putting this issue above all
                    others. My answer was that I used to hear the same song from Pat Derian on human
                    rights when I was in the East Asia Bureau. I felt strongly that issues like that
                    had to be viewed in a broader perspective and could not be tackled absent
                    consideration of a whole panoply of matters. I applied the same general approach
                    to talking to the Europeans about terrorism. It was important that we be very
                    careful and certain about our goal when we knocked on the European door. I
                    didn't think we could or would make much progress unless our facts undeniably
                    pointed to a specific perpetrator, whether be an individual, a group or a
                    country. (Our efforts to get them to apply sanctions to Likud [the conservative
                    Israeli political party] was a case in point.) We could not deal with
                    generalities; speculation would not do, even if based on fragmentary
                    information. Our case had to be solid and well documented because I understood
                    that the Europeans had their own interests which could only be set aside by a
                    complete and well marshaled set of facts. Once we had obtained hard information,
                    then I thought we could get the results we desired. The Europeans had a more
                    legalistic approach to counter-terrorism than we had; furthermore, they had
                    important commercial relations with the countries that were suspected of
                    providing support to terrorism. They also tend to consider themselves as more
                    seasoned with cooler heads, unlike the U.S. which was viewed as that hot-headed
                    and impetuous cowboy going after the “bad” guys. They were more skeptical about
                    the cause and effect of terrorism than we were and also viewed our information
                    about the extent of terrorism with some suspicion. Finally, the Europeans were
                    highly skeptical about the effectiveness of sanctions, if we reached that stage.
                    So the gap between us and the Europeans on counter-terrorism was pretty
                    wide.</p>
                <p>Our tools to counter terrorism were our military capabilities, economic
                    sanctions, intelligence and law enforcement, which I consider to be the
                    principal tools. Everyone had his or her own views about the effectiveness of
                    sanctions. I believe that one should use sanctions - infrequently - after having
                    obtained agreement from those countries that might have an effect on the target
                    country. Unless all countries that have significant commercial relationships
                    with the target country are on board, the sanction regime will not likely be
                    very effective. The sanctions should have an immediate impact; that requires a
                    careful targeting. I have never thought that broad scale sanctions were very
                    effective because they tend to generate a lot of popular support for the
                    existing regime within the target country - and sometimes even support for that
                    regime from outside its country. What is required is a tightly targeted sanction
                    which has an immediate impact. Also, the longer the sanctions remain in place
                    the less useful they are because the regime and the people learn to live with
                    them. Those sanctions may be inconvenient, but they will not be sufficient to
                    alter the regime's policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>In my opinion, we have not marshaled the resources of the international banking
                    system enough, although we and the British have done it more than others. That
                    system is useful both in tracking what is going on and in stopping it. But there
                    is a lot more that can be done which would have a devastating effect on the
                    target country. This would require intervention in international financial flows
                    which cannot be done lightly - it is a very sensitive political and financial
                    issue which I think has barred the international community from using it very
                    much.I mentioned earlier that I thought that intelligence and law enforcement
                    were the main counter-terrorism tools available to governments. By that, I mean
                    tracking of terrorist groups and individuals to determine their patterns of
                    operation, unearthing lines of command and control, and obtaining intelligence
                    that will assist in the prevention of a terrorist action - which we did on a
                    number of occasions. We were able to penetrate terrorist ranks. In fact, in
                    Spain, on one occasion, we even set off a bomb inside a U.S. installation, but
                    in a place where it would be harmless, to protect our source. She planted the
                    bomb and I assume thereafter still remained a bone fide member of terrorist cell
                    but no Americans were killed. There were a good number of instances of that
                    kind; if you are very patient and if you play your cards right, you can track
                    down terrorists for years - such as those who traveled to Europe from Lebanon
                    thinking that they were in clear who were then captured. We caught a couple of
                    the perpetrators of TWA 747 hijacking that way; they were captured in Germany
                    and extradited to the U.S. when they thought they had beat our vigil. So if you
                    are very patient, you can identify terrorists, follow them and when they land in
                    an accessible place, you can arrest them.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>We used to have arguments within the executive branch between those who advocated
                    assassinations - even if illegal - or kidnaping. One of my more interesting
                    experience was being involved in an argument with State and Justice on one side
                    and CIA and the NSC on the other concerning the desirability and feasibility of
                    kidnaping a certain “Mughniyah,” one of the chief Hezbollah terrorists,
                    responsible for blowing up the Marine barracks in Beirut. The CIA believed him
                    to be in Paris. I heard about this proposal from one of my friends in the FBI. I
                    immediately went to see Secretary Shultz, just before he went to see Attorney
                    General Meese. I argued against the action and while I was briefing the
                    Secretary, he got a call from Bud McFarlane of the NSC. Bud said that the
                    President had approved Director of Central Intelligence Casey's recommendation
                    to kidnap Mughniyah off the streets of Paris. That started a three day running
                    battle in the SITROOM [White House Situation Room] with Justice, FBI and myself
                    saying “No,” the NSC staff and CIA saying “Yes”. We wanted to have President
                    Reagan send a message to President Mitterrand saying that we know that the
                    Lebanese terrorist was in Paris - in a specific place - charging that he was
                    responsible for the death of our Marines as well as some Frenchmen. We wanted to
                    tell the French that in light of Mughniyah's track record, we were sure that the
                    French would arrest him. Others maintained that the French could not be trusted
                    on a matter of this kind and that we were the only ones who could apply due
                    justice. We asked what the U.S. would do with him in our courts once we had
                    kidnaped him to the U.S. Even more importantly, we made the case that our action
                    would destroy any hopes of further French cooperation in all law enforcement
                    efforts - terrorism, narcotics, etc. That latter point was the one that Justice
                    felt particularly strong about; it had a lot of relationships with its French
                    counterparts on all sorts of all criminal activities which it didn't wish to
                    jeopardize. We in State also were opposed to such strong arm action; it would
                    have damaged diplomatic relationship; we believed that the French should be
                    given an opportunity to play a role.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Then Mughniyah reportedly disappeared - he could never be firmly located. In
                    fact, we could not be sure that he had ever been in Paris. Two weeks later, we
                    received another CIA report sighting him in Paris. We reported that to the
                    French. The following week, the French happened to have a delegation in
                    Washington to discuss counter-terrorism. One of the members took me aside and
                    told me that the information we had provided on Mughniyah was very interesting.
                    The French had followed up and raided the hotel room in which we told them he
                    was supposed to be. They found a 50 year old Spaniard tourist where a 25 year
                    old Lebanese terrorist was supposed to be. He was very surprised. So neither we
                    or the French found the Lebanese terrorist. This incident is an illustration of
                    a larger point: how far can the U.S. go in capturing terrorists in foreign
                    countries? My view is that you may be able to get rid of one terrorist, but he
                    will be replaced quickly by another member of the cell. I think the Israelis
                    have found that out. Not only will the loss be marginal, but it may have the
                    effect of agitating the terrorists even more and almost invites retaliation. If
                    you can capture or eliminate the whole cell, that may be quite useful, but to
                    eliminate one member will not be very useful. And if that elimination was done
                    in a way that might have been embarrassing to an allied country, it would have a
                    negative effect on the whole counter-terrorism effort because it would
                    substantially reduce future opportunities for cooperation in law enforcement. We
                    are dealing with sovereign countries who consider themselves competent to handle
                    law enforcement within their own borders. I think we have to be very careful
                    when we look at our options in countering terrorism in another country. I prefer
                    building up cooperation with other countries, rather than the U.S. playing a
                    “lone wolf” game. There may be some exceptions, such as the Libya raid, which we
                    had to do because the Libyans had targeted Americans; in that case, we
                    retaliated and then showed the Europeans why we had taken unilateral action.
                    When they saw the evidence, the Europeans were taken aback and abashed and were
                    more cooperative after that.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I think it is very difficult to combat terrorism with more of what others would
                    see as terrorism. I don't think there would be much support in this country for
                    such a policy; it would be morally, ethically, politically unacceptable to the
                    American public for its government to engage in such distasteful activities.
                    There were some people in the administration that supported consideration of
                    such activities; there was a lot of pressure after the Beirut Marine barracks
                    attack for the U.S. to become pro-active. The question was why we did not attack
                    the known terrorists in West Beirut or why we should wait until they tried to
                    cross the line into East Beirut to take further action against us before we took
                    action against them. That is of course what happened; the terrorists did cross
                    into East Beirut in 1985 and blew up our new Embassy. In a meeting at the White
                    House when we decided to support the creation of a Lebanese counter-terrorist
                    team run by their military intelligence organization, Claire George of the CIA
                    and I - both of us having served in Beirut - said that we must have some very
                    careful checks on the Lebanese plans before the U.S. provided any direct
                    assistance. We wanted to be sure that the Lebanese team was properly trained and
                    disciplined; we certainly did not want another “loose cannon” roaming the
                    streets of Beirut. In fact, this team was checked three times by our experts and
                    three times it was found wanting. We did have a Presidential finding to support
                    the team; I testified on behalf of the finding before the Intelligence
                    Committees with George. When the Imam who was the spiritual leader of the
                    Lebanese Shiites was almost blown up, we found that the Lebanese intelligence
                    team had been the culprit, using resources that they had managed to scrape up
                    from somewhere, perhaps Saudi Arabia. Fortunately, we had in fact never given a
                    cent of assistance to the team because it had not passed the test. We were ready
                    to provide assistance had the Lebanese passed inspection, but they could not
                    meet our standards. George and I were concerned that a Lebanese hit squad,
                    without proper training and control, could do more damage than good and in fact,
                    I think we were proven correct. After the attempt on the Imam, there was big
                    expos� in the Washington Post charging the U.S. both with responsibility for
                    that attack - which required us to explain to Congress what had really happened.
                    That episode is an illustration of another broad point - before the U.S. gets
                    involved in any counter-terrorist operations, it must be very careful that the
                    activity is tightly controlled; otherwise it may end up with unintended
                    consequences which damage all.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>After two years in the job, I came to the conclusion that there was clear
                    Communist involvement in terrorism. There were a number of different terrorist
                    organizations, some of which were supported by various Communist organizations,
                    but not necessarily controlled by them. It was certain that there was not one
                    single operations center in Moscow which pulled the strings all over the world,
                    contrary to what author Claire Sterling and perhaps [CIA director] Casey
                    thought. But we were able to find that Abu Nidal and other Palestinian terrorist
                    organizations not only had offices in several Eastern European capitals, but
                    also own and operated commercial enterprises, which were very profitable. They
                    also had operational cells in many places in the world. I remember having a
                    lengthy discussion with one of the senior officials of the Yugoslav Ministry of
                    Interior; he was responsible for liaison with terrorist organizations. He had
                    spent considerable time with Carlos the Jackal, Abu Nidal, and others -
                    including Croatian terrorists. At one stage I suggested to him that they were
                    playing with fire. The Yugoslavs may have found it in the short run convenient
                    to give asylum to these terrorists, but I wondered how they could be certain
                    that the terrorists would not turn around and bite the hand that fed them. I
                    told the Yugoslav that the French were in the same situation. They also knew
                    that they had Arab terrorists in their country; the French were convinced that
                    they were safe from any terrorist action on their soil as long as they extended
                    asylum. But the French found that the terrorists would leave and then mount
                    operations and return to safety in France. The French found that to be quite
                    embarrassing. About a month after this conversation, Yugoslav-based Arab
                    terrorists, under instruction from Abu Nidal, mounted an operation at two
                    Italian airports - Rome and another. They blew up bombs in these facilities at
                    great loss of life, expense and embarrassment to Italian authorities. At that
                    point, the Yugoslavs felt they had enough and kicked out all of the terrorists
                    they were sheltering. In any case, it was clear that the terrorists had a lot of
                    Communist support but in most cases, the terrorist operations were not
                    controlled by Moscow.</p>
                <p>I have been asked whether after two years as counter-terrorist coordinator, I
                    reached any conclusions about the causes of terrorism. There are all sorts.
                    There are people who feel they have suffered personal injustices - either to
                    themselves or their families. Then there are those who belong to a group -
                    religious, ethnic, national - which feels it has been punished unjustly. There
                    were some cases of ideologues, particularly religious ones. When you mix
                    religion with politics and add some personal grievance, you get a very explosive
                    combination. As I will discuss later, the Afghan Mujahideen are a perfect
                    illustration of this volatile mix. Essentially, there are three different kinds
                    of terrorist groups: 1) those that wish to make a statement to show their
                    unhappiness; 2) those who want to exact vengeance; and 3) those that desire to
                    actually bring about a change in policies - e.g. “If we blow up enough
                    Americans, maybe the U.S. will get out of Lebanon” - which is exactly what we
                    did after the Marine barracks were blown up. The shock of that event was so
                    great that we changed policy and declared Lebanon no longer of vital importance
                    to the U.S. The French were similarly “convinced” to withdraw from Algeria.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Economic deprivation can also be a cause of terrorism. People feel aggrieved for
                    a number of reasons. Recently, there was a very good article in the New York
                    Times which made the point that the U.S. is so rich, so big, so powerful that we
                    stand out alone in the world, thereby attracting all sorts of animosities. Given
                    the high tech nature of the world - for which we are to some degree responsible
                    - some of that animosity will inevitably be visited upon us. Here again, I think
                    that Clinton so far has done a better job than Reagan because the U.S. is not in
                    a state of near panic. In the middle 1980s the U.S. was terribly anxious -
                    placing dump trucks around the State Department, etc. I argued at the time that
                    we should not be so agitated and anxious because I thought that was just what
                    the terrorists were seeking. They knew that they had our number by our reaction.
                    When Jimmy Carter sat in the Rose Garden, the Iranians knew that they had won.
                    Some terrorists are primarily interested in intimidating the U.S.; when they see
                    that they can do so, they are incited to mount more terrorist activities. So I
                    was very impressed when I attended the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 by the calm
                    demeanor that the people there were exhibiting. They - the athletes, the
                    citizens, the spectators - were not going to let the bomb explosion and the
                    continuing threat spoil their good time. They just had a better time than
                    ever.</p>
                <p>There was always pressure to get things done, to take action. For example, I was
                    one who argued against sending our special forces into South Beirut in an
                    attempt to rescue American hostages. I thought it was an ill conceived idea
                    because no one could be sure precisely where the hostages were being held and
                    secondly, even if we knew before the expedition where they were, the
                    probabilities would be very high that they would have been moved by the time the
                    troops actually landed. I also wondered how easy it would be to get out of
                    Beirut without an unacceptable level of losses. This idea was proposed on
                    several occasions and I was among those who opposed it. So pressure for some
                    action is always present.</p>
                <p>Despite his interest in terrorism, I usually did not have direct access to
                    Secretary Shultz. [Under Secretary for Management] Ron Spiers and [Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs] Mike Armacost carried the main burden of
                    dealing with the Secretary. I worked primarily with Nick Platt, the Department's
                    Executive Secretary, and Mike. I saw the Secretary mostly in group meetings. For
                    a while, he used to have a small morning meeting every morning at 8:30 on
                    terrorism with Mike and Ron and myself to review the situation - the same way
                    Secretary Christopher now reviews the Bosnia situation. Occasionally, I would
                    meet one-on-one with the Secretary, but that was a rare instance. After about
                    six months, the terrorist situation calmed down and the Secretary discontinued
                    his morning meetings. I used to see Deputy Secretary Whitehead occasionally, but
                    terrorism was primarily Shultz' concern. Whitehead was the senior official who
                    initially blocked a reorganization plan to put State's counterterrorism policy
                    under the Diplomatic Security Bureau. He was the one who convinced the Secretary
                    to reverse himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Let me say a few words about Ollie North, who was my point of contact in the NSC.
                    I got to know him pretty well. He was fascinating, exasperating, exhausting to
                    work with. He could do more than any other six people could do. He had
                    incredible energy, imagination, initiative, charisma; he was unequaled in his
                    ability to get people to do things his way. Ollie was an exceptional officer.
                    But, as I said to him several times, he needed to be assisted by people with
                    more seasoning and experience who could keep things on track. Sometimes, he
                    would pay heed to my comments; sometimes he would not. He was a hyper-activist;
                    he always wanted to project U.S. power against terrorism. He would support
                    fighting terrorists with terrorists. Unilaterally, he tried to activate a group
                    in southern Lebanon, using DEA connections - State and CIA would have no part of
                    this scheme. So he tried to work on his own with the Israelis to establish those
                    counter-terrorist group, which would use terrorist methods.</p>
                <p>Ollie was always urging more military action. He wanted more strikes against
                    Qadhafi. He wanted to capture terrorists in south Lebanon and Beirut. Ollie was
                    a strong proponent for all sorts of counter-terrorist actions. I opposed the use
                    of force to rescue the hostages in Beirut. Military contingency plans were
                    developed by the Pentagon. These plans were then circulated to a group of people
                    from all interested agencies, including myself. The formal inter-agency
                    counter-terrorist group did not officially get involved in these plans, but of
                    course many members of the group, in their departmental roles, were involved. In
                    addition to the formal inter-agency steering group, we also had an inter-agency
                    Operation Support Group which met weekly to discuss highly sensitive operational
                    matters. That group included the Assistant Secretary for International Security
                    Affairs from DoD, the Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
                    the chief of CIA's counter-terrorism branch, an FBI official, the NSC
                    counter-terrorism officer and myself. In this meeting, we used to kick around a
                    number of ideas, many coming from Ollie North, most of which were dismissed. For
                    example, I already mentioned North's idea of a special counter-terrorist force -
                    which this Operations Support group would not endorse, so he went out and tried
                    to create one on his own. There were many very sensitive issues discussed in
                    this group. I thought in general the members of the group were very good -
                    imaginative yet solid. When Ollie and his boss, [John ] Poindexter, would
                    listen, this group did come up with very sensible, pro-active suggestions to
                    deal with terrorism - not enough to stop the activity in total, but certainly to
                    slow it down and diminish it. Just as useful, was this group's willingness to
                    say “No” to a number of propositions. As has been discussed frequently, when the
                    NSC did not think that the bureaucracy was giving it enough support, it would
                    frequently go at it alone - not only on counter-terrorism, but in many different
                    areas. Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary for ARA, was by far a more
                    enthusiastic supporter oContra assistance than I was about dealing with Iran.
                    Whatever he and Ollie did to support the Contras was done outside of established
                    channels - partly to avoid established policies. Ollie would frequently come to
                    see me after he had met with Alan Fiers and Abrams; this allowed me to pick up
                    information about the Contra support operation that would not have reached me
                    through the bureaucracy. I became aware of the flow of money and military
                    equipment to the Contras; so, although in bits and pieces, I had a pretty good
                    idea what was going on under what is now known as the Contra-Iran operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>As time went on, it became obvious that Ollie was withholding more and more
                    information. At one point - in March 1986 - he came to me and said that
                    Poindexter had decided that I had not been sufficiently sympathetic and
                    cooperative and therefore had instructed North to cut me out of the loop. That
                    was personally very helpful because I was able to say that thereafter I knew
                    nothing about Iran-Contra. Before March, I had known something about that
                    operation - not in detail, but I did have a general idea. On June 30, 1986, I
                    wrote a memorandum to the Secretary informing him about what I knew about
                    Iran-Contra. I sent the memo because I was quite concerned; we at levels lower
                    than the Secretary thought the operation had ceased, only to find out that we
                    were wrong. We accepted that the supporters of the operation genuinely thought
                    that they were serving the President's best interests; furthermore they were
                    under the impression that they could keep the operation secret. However, I was
                    convinced the Administration was headed toward serious trouble.</p>
                <p>What actually provoked the memo was a visit by a British Foreign Office official
                    and Mrs. Thatcher's National Security Advisor. They came to Washington to
                    discuss what we were doing with respect to Iran. They wanted to know whether we
                    had changed our policy; they had heard that we were engaged is making some deals
                    with the Iranians - supplying weapons in exchange for release of hostages. The
                    British position was that it had supported us fully: by allowing us, for
                    example, to use their bases for the bombing raid on Libya - three British
                    citizens had been executed in Lebanon in retaliation and revenge in an operation
                    financed by Qadhafi. The British were upset by the rumors - they had stuck their
                    necks out to support us and felt let down by what appeared to be a change in our
                    and terrorist Iran policy - our rhetoric and our actions did not seem to be in
                    sync. After the departure of the British delegation, I wrote the memorandum.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether he ever read my memo - only the Secretary and probably
                    Charlie Hill and Nick Platt [his executive assistant] would know. It never came
                    back to me and I assume that he read it, but since I didn't get an answer, I
                    can't be sure. At the time, I concluded that Secretary Shultz was probably upset
                    by the memorandum - I should have known better than to write a memorandum on
                    such a sensitive subject with which the Secretary was probably familiar. I
                    concluded that he knew and was unable to stop the operation and that it would
                    continue to the end. That analysis led me to the conclusion that it was time for
                    me to get out of counter-terrorism. Among other reasons I was upset that the
                    British delegation, which I mentioned earlier, had left Washington without being
                    told the truth. They told me what they had heard from Poindexter; when I heard
                    that, I knew that they had been lied to.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>As far as Iran-Contra was concerned, even though the NSC was not sharing any
                    information with me, I knew something about what was going on from my friends in
                    CIA and the Pentagon - they had more information on this matter than I did. From
                    that, I deduced that the operation was still on-going - not stopped as we had
                    thought. It was not under control and it was clear to me that it would not stop.
                    I also thought that the matter would become public - sooner than later - because
                    if the British had picked up information, so would others. What I did not know
                    at the time was that the British had been bugging Ollie North's meetings with
                    the Iranians which took place in London. So they had good information and
                    obviously knew enough to know that Poindexter had not told them the whole truth.
                    I made this point to the Secretary. My memorandum saved my reputation - and
                    probably career - because it was part of the official file and available to the
                    staff of the Congressional Iran-Contra Investigation Committee.</p>
                <p>In any case, I felt most uncomfortable about continuing to work in
                    counter-terrorism when one part of the U.S. government was engaged in an
                    activity to which I strenuously objected. Iran-Contra was in flat contradiction
                    to our expressed policies towards Iran and terrorists. I didn't think it was
                    proper nor did I think the operation would be successful. I don't think there
                    had been an adequate analysis made of the potential consequences of action. For
                    example, a letter was written by Reagan to the King of Saudi Arabia, flatly
                    denying that we were providing any arms to Iran. That was not appropriate; we
                    were jeopardizing relationships with friends and allies and at the same time,
                    violating our own policies. Both consequences were huge mistakes and I thought,
                    as I said to the Secretary, that the whole operation would backfire in the near
                    future, then becoming a major domestic as well as international issue. As
                    reflected in Weinberger's book, someone in the NSC - probably Poindexter -
                    called Bill Odum - the head of NSA - and instructed him to shut off the
                    distribution of intercepts concerning Iran to Defense and State. According to
                    Weinberger, when Odum told him that the White House had issued instructions; the
                    Secretary of Defense said that “Houses don't talk”, and told Odum he wanted the
                    name of the official who had issued the order. He further told the NSA chief
                    that since his budget depended on the Pentagon - i.e. the Secretary of Defense -
                    (the NSA budget being part of the defense budget) unless the order had come from
                    the President personally, he was to resume the distribution - which is what NSA
                    did. Armacost and I suggested to Secretary Shultz that he might want to have the
                    State distribution resumed; he said “No.” So we continued to operate in the
                    dark, but Rich Armitage, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, viewed the
                    operation as I did; he kept me advised about information that I didn't have.
                    That helped me piece together about what was taking place, but we had no
                    influence on North's operation since we had been deliberately cut out. When the
                    British delegation arrived I managed to put the last pieces in place and then I
                    understood the enormity of what was going on. I knew that no good would come of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I wanted out, which led me to the Carnegie Foundation where I worked as a Fellow.
                    As I said, I opposed the Iran-Contra operation. I could have joined a public
                    protest, as some had done when they disagreed with their government's policies.
                    I decided not to do that; I made my views known and then went to Carnegie with
                    the intention of retiring from the Foreign Service, but it never went that far.
                    The Secretary agreed to make my tour as Director of Counter-terrorism a two year
                    tour; that made my departure appear to be part of a normal rotation. In theory,
                    it was an open-ended tour, but by making it a two year assignment it enabled me
                    to go to Carnegie. I was just fed up and I didn't want to be a party to the
                    covert operations that North was running. Iran-Contra blew up about two months
                    after I left the Department, as I assumed it would.</p>
                <p>I should mention two episodes, one of which was very funny, which occurred while
                    I was at Carnegie. I appeared on McNeill-Lehrer PBS television show for a
                    discussion about what might be done to get the hostages back specifically and
                    terrorism in general. There were three of us on the panel. My colleagues were
                    focusing on Syria as the major sponsor of terrorism and the government
                    responsible for the hostages. I maintained that Iran should really be in the
                    spotlight, and not just Syria. I thought that on the program I had indirectly,
                    but clearly, drawn a road map of what was actually going on. When I got home, I
                    got a call from Poindexter who told me what a wonderful job I had done in
                    defending the administration. It occurred to me that I must have been too opaque
                    because that certainly was not my intention and I didn't think I had done so by
                    referring to Iran as the address for action on hostage release; it was obvious
                    that Poindexter had not understood what I had said.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The other story, which is perhaps more interesting, occurred the day after
                    Iran-Contra broke. I went to the Hill on my own initiative to have a long talk
                    with Senator Nunn [Democrat, Georgia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services
                    Committee]. I briefed him on what I knew about Iran-Contra - the background, the
                    rationale, the problems, etc. I predicted that the operation would turn out to
                    be deeply embarrassing not only to the Reagan administration, but to the U.S. as
                    a country. I suggested that if anyone really cared, a Congressional commission
                    should be established to investigate the whole operation - before rumors and
                    innuendos would bar a serious discussion of the operation, the process and
                    lessons learned or before a brust of anger caused Congress to take rash action
                    against the President which the coultry could ill afford. That is what I think
                    helped lead to the Tower Commission, which Senator Nunn immediately began to
                    advocate.I didn't talk to Ollie about Iran-Contra after I left for Carnegie. The
                    closest we came to having a conversation was at a small dinner in September 1986
                    which I hosted for Anirem Neer, the Israeli counter-terrorist adviser to Perez,
                    in a Georgetown restaurant. The Israeli official was later blown up in Mexico.
                    The Norths were there as were Phyllis and I. Then we talked a little about
                    Iran-Contra. Perez, the Labor Party leader, saw that the Likud Party had
                    orginally had its businessmen handle the arms transfers from Israel to Iran.
                    That really put them in the driver's seat; not only did the Likud get the money,
                    but it also endeared itself to the White House. So Perez appointed Neer to pull
                    the transactions into official channels - away from the Likud. So Neer became
                    North's Israeli contact and the two of them apparently initiated a number of
                    actions - unbeknown to me. The trip to Tehran which Neer and North both went on
                    fell into this category. By cooperating with North, Perez won some Brownie
                    points with the White House and forced the Likud out of the picture. So in
                    Israel, Iran-Contra turned out to be in part a political battle for White House
                    support and for revenues from arms sales.</p>
                <p>There was another aspect of the Israeli connection that was interesting. Shultz,
                    working through his Executive Assistant, Charlie Hill, set up a channel through
                    Benjamin Netanyahu, then the Israeli Ambassador to the UN, to Shamir, the
                    Israeli Prime Minister - cutting out embassies and the Foreign Ministry. Under
                    the coalition government then in power, Labor had the Foreign Ministry, but the
                    Shultz-Shamir channel cut it out. That is the way Lukud operated and the way

                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Frank Carlucci and I have always been good friends and Frank had followed
                    my career. We had talked about the mess at the NSC, exemplified by Iran-Contra.
                    He called me one day and said that he had been asked to take the National
                    Security Advisor job and that Colin Powell would be his deputy. He asked whether
                    I would be interested in being his Middle East man. I told him that I was
                    seriously considering retirement and that I had already served on the NSC staff.
                    He said that he had not volunteered for the NSC job and that he took it when
                    President Reagan called because he was a good soldier and there was a lot to do.
                    He added that I knew both the NSC and the Middle East well and that I could be
                    of great help to him in straightening that staff out. (I had been in that same
                    job about ten years earlier when I worked for Brent Scowcroft in the Ford
                    administration.) I agreed to take the Middle East-South Asia Directorate
                    again.</p>
                <p>I found considerable difference between the NSC staff of the 1970s and that of
                    the 1980s. Going back to the NSC brought back some memories. As I was leaving at
                    the end of the Ford administration, along with everyone else, I noted that the
                    new Carter team, headed by Brzezinski, decided to change the entire NSC system,
                    not just the players. The process of decision making, moving papers, ensuring
                    that all views of Departments and Agencies were fairly represented to the
                    President which was in existence at the end of 1976 had been set up by Kissinger
                    with the help of a wonderful person, Jean Davis - who also had helped to set up
                    the State and Treasury Secretariats years earlier. Dick Kennedy was the
                    Executive Secretary of the NSC. We begged him and anyone else who would listen
                    not to get rid of the system because a) it was very complicated and b) it had
                    served previous Presidents well. But the Carter team and Zbig had decided that
                    the system had been responsible for the bad policy. We argued that in fact the
                    occasional short-circuiting of the system by Kissinger might have resulted in
                    some bad decisions but the system was probably as good as could be designed. Our
                    argument did not prevail.</p>
                <p>The result was that there was no system worthy of being called that during the
                    Carter regime and for the first six years of the Reagan administration. It was
                    more ad hoc than systematic. Dick Allen and his successors did not change what
                    they had inherited from Zbig. The consequences of an inadequate system became
                    evident as Iran-Contra was exposed. During the McFarlane-Poindexter period
                    almost everyone on the staff was going his or her own way with little
                    supervision and often with no regard for other agencies. There was no real
                    national security system in terms of evaluating policy options and coordinating
                    Executive Branch actions. After Don Fortier died, Poindexter had essentially a
                    flat structure, with approximately 30 staffers all reporting to him. That meant
                    that essentially each staffer operated independently with little supervision; it
                    was not only Ollie North who exercised that freedom, but I think almost the
                    whole NSC staff did.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>So the first thing that Carlucci and Powell set out to do was to set up a system.
                    They were both personally well organized; furthermore, Frank had a lot of
                    experience with the military system and of course Powell had grown up in that
                    system. They called Jean Davis back to help them. They found that all sorts of
                    papers and recommendations were going to the President, without proper vetting
                    and screening. Many bypassed the NSC Advisor. So Carlucci and Powell took
                    control of the paper flow and instituted a very orderly system of procedures,
                    similar to the one that I had worked with ten years earlier.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Carlucci and Powell changed the structure of the NSC to a much more
                    hierarchal one. They had, I believe, six senior directors, each of whom had a
                    staff rather than a flat structure. So controls were put in place to govern the
                    actions of the NSC staff. For example, there had been five different offices
                    working on Afghanistan during the Poindexter regime - diplomacy, public
                    information, covert action, humanitarian action, etc; they were all combined
                    into one under my supervision. There were other illustrations of organizational
                    tightening that Carlucci and Powell undertook. Dennis Ross was nominally
                    handling the Middle East, but he had no responsibility for Afghanistan nor was
                    he involved or informed on the wheeling and dealing with Iran which so disrupted
                    our policy toward the Gulf and upset Saudi Arabia. After he found out what had
                    been going on, he was happy that he didn't know, but it was a poor way to run a
                    show. Thanks to the efforts of Carlucci and Powell, Dennis was persuaded to stay
                    with the NSC even though he became my Deputy rather than remaining as senior
                    director. Bill Burns stayed on to handle the Gulf and North Africa. Shirin Tabir
                    Kelly stayed on to handle South Asia. She had been operating pretty much on her
                    own, but she willingly stayed on in the more disciplined organization. I think
                    the new system and organization worked quite well, reinforcing the personal
                    leadership qualities of Carlucci and Powell. Because it was so similar to what
                    he had been accustomed ten years earlier, Scowcroft took it over lock, stock and
                    barrel when he started to work as the NSC Advisor for President Bush.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>Carlucci and Powell not only changed the NSC system, but also hired a lot of “new
                    blood.” They managed to get rid of all the North legacies; they closed the
                    Office of Politico-Military Affairs where he had worked and which had cut out
                    other NSC officers. They got rid of all the people involved in intelligence work
                    - the principal conduits to the CIA - even though some of the analysts there may
                    not have been involved in the North operations. Carlucci and Powell felt in the
                    offices directly involved a 100% turn over was required in light of the events
                    of the previous two years. They did the same thing for the Latin America Office.
                    They wanted to make sure that there was no appearance of carry-over of the
                    improprieties. Essentially, the NSC under Carlucci and Powell began with a clean
                    slate. They brought in a lot of experienced senior people they had known
                    personally - e.g. Ambassador Hank Cohen for Africa. The NSC in 1987 was staffed
                    with top notch people. We worked quite collegially, both within the NSC and with
                    other agencies. There was a little friction at the beginning because George
                    Shultz wanted to be the top man in national security affairs after Casey - his
                    chief nemesis - was gone. Shultz wanted to call all the shots, but Carlucci is
                    not the kind of person to be run over by anyone. It wasn't too long before
                    Shultz realized that he could work well with Frank, and advance his agenda, not
                    have it hijacked. That revelation came during some of the disarmament
                    discussions with the Soviets when the Secretary realized how helpful a good NSC
                    advisor could be. A very collegial approach developed; State wasn't running
                    everything but was kept fully informed and had their views fully heard. Shultz
                    and the Department lived with that quite happily. At my level, relationships
                    were very good. Occasionally, I would be reprimanded for having seen a foreign
                    ambassador, but it soon became clear that the NSC was not an operational
                    organization, and there were no secret policies at the NSC. The fears that had
                    been prevalent under the Poindexter regime soon faded from bureaucratic memory.
                    I did see foreign ambassadors from time to time as did others on the NSC staff
                    which raised some suspicion in the State bureaucracy. But we did not operate
                    like Kissinger; our meetings were simply for a direct exchange of views. After
                    the bureaucracy began to have confidence that the NSC staff was not trying to
                    undermine it, meetings with foreign officials became routine - as long as we
                    fully shared any information that we might have picked up. Dick Murphy, the
                    Assistant Secretary for NEA, and I never had any problems.</p>
                <p>The NSC Near East division became what it had been ten years earlier. It covered
                    North Africa, the Middle East, the Gulf and South Asia. Our workload was much
                    heavier than it had been in 1974-77. But if you don't take too much operational
                    responsibility, it can be handled, particularly if you have a good staff - with
                    which I was blessed. All of the three officers who worked for me were
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>As far as the Middle East was concerned, Camp David had happened in the interim.
                    So the area was considerably different from the one I had left. There remained
                    several problems unresolved such as Israel's relationships with Syria and
                    Jordan. The Palestinians and Lebanon needed a lot of attention. When I started
                    in 1987, the peace process had stalled in the aftermath of the Lebanon
                    debacle.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>The President did not place the so-called Middle East peace process high on his
                    agenda. He paid some attention to it, but only as situations required. Shultz
                    and Dick Murphy paid attention to the peace process in 1987-88 and tried to move
                    it along together with Perez and Shamir, but they were not very successful.</p>
                <p>When I started in the NSC, Iran and Iraq were at war and the Gulf was in an
                    uproar. Ships to and from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were being attacked, and these
                    countries and others (e.g. Abu Dhabi, Oman, Bahrain) felt seriously threatened.
                    This was a different aspect of the Middle East. My first question was: “Where
                    have we been?” The dangers to shipping - including American bottoms - in Gulf
                    was increasing. Kuwait and other GCC [the Gulf Cooperation Council] countries
                    had asked the U.S. for assistance. We had not answered. They then went to the
                    USSR for help; there they got a positive response. Our apparent disinterest in
                    this issue together with the revelation that we had provided Iran some very
                    sophisticated military equipment covertly - e.g HAWK [anti-air] and TOW
                    [anti-tank] missiles - made a very strong impression on the GCC states. They
                    came to the conclusion that we were dealing with their enemy behind their backs
                    and seemed very disinterested in helping them in a very tense situation -
                    Iranian artillery could be heard in a major attack upon Iraq as the Organization
                    of Islamic States Summit was taking place in Kuwait in January 1987. Iraq was at
                    that time seen as a friend, a bulwark against the threat from Iran.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>The NSC staff reviewed our position in the Gulf; we talked to people in State and
                    DOD [Defense] and all agreed that it was time for the U.S. to respond positively
                    to the assistance requests from the GCC to protect shipping in the Gulf. We were
                    not too concerned about the Iran-Iraq war spreading throughout the region. We
                    were concerned about the potential political impact of a victory by one side or
                    the other. In early 1987, the Iranians had much the upper hand. We considered
                    the possibility that they might cut the road from Basra to Baghdad which could
                    have had a profound effect throughout the region. The administration was willing
                    to help Iraq - within limits. We set up a very orderly process to determine what
                    assistance we might offer Iraq and under what circumstances. We analyzed that
                    issue very carefully - openly with State, DoD, CIA and other agencies, not
                    covertly as had been done before by the NSC staff. The bureaucracy in general
                    agreed that some assistance was desirable. For example, Iraq asked that the
                    Jordanians come to their help with some very sophisticated U.S. counter-battery
                    radar to be used to find the location of SCUD missiles which were being fired
                    from Iran. We turned that request down because even if under Jordanian control
                    we were reluctant to have such sophisticated equipment in Iraq. We were willing
                    to allow less sophisticated U.S. radar equipment into Iraq under Jordanian
                    control, but not the highly sophisticated radar. That is an illustration of the
                    scrutiny we gave each request. There were questions about extending CCC
                    [agriculture export loan] credits to Iraq. That was also carefully reviewed,
                    unlike previous instances were decision were made without proper screening by
                    appropriate agencies. I thought that our actions vis-a-vis Iraq were handled
                    thoroughly and well. There was of course a lot of inter-agency discussion, but I
                    think we forged a consensus on most issues. Where decisions had to be made to
                    overrule an agency, that process went smoothly because the agency felt that it
                    had gotten a full hearing of its views. I fully supported the consensus
                    decisions of this inter-agency mechanism.</p>
                <p>I thought we were right in trying to support the UN in its mediation efforts. I
                    also believed that helping Iraq maintain its independence and territorial
                    integrity was an appropriate course. The cutting in half of Iraq would not have
                    been in our interest since our main goal was the independence of the Gulf
                    states; they would have been quite concerned had we allowed Iraq to be carved up
                    - particularly coming after what had become public about U.S. arms sales to
                    Iran. All of this of course happened before we found out that the Iraqis were
                    working on developing and producing a nuclear device. The problems that faced
                    the U.S. later on had not yet arisen; so our cautious support for a whole Iraq
                    was perfectly defensible in the 1987-88 period. If the problems were around,
                    they were latent and not yet on our scope.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>In 1988, the vast accumulation of modern military equipment that Iraq had been
                    buying - primarily from France and the USSR - and the training that had been
                    provided to the Republican Guards, all came together. We found that Iraq had
                    developed a considerably increased military capability. It began to plan very
                    systematically for a counter-attack on the Iranians. That attack turned out to
                    be spectacularly successful. We were aware of the increased Iraqi capability
                    through intelligence collection. For example, we had photographs of Iraqi troops
                    practicing for an attack on the Faw Peninsula well before it took place. That
                    turned out to be a decisive battle. The practice took place on an area the size
                    of about four football fields; you could see in the photographs the replica of
                    the terrain features that the Iraqis would face on the Faw Peninsula. Later, we
                    were accused by the Iranians of having joined with the Iraqis in that attack in
                    retaliation for Iranian missile and mine attacks on our ships in the Gulf. But
                    all we did in retaliation was to knock out some Iranian oil platforms which were
                    being used for military reconnaissance and as bases for missile boats. I think
                    the Iranians actually believed that we were acting in concert with Iraq, but in
                    fact the two military actions just happen to coincide in time; there was no
                    Iraq-U.S. collusion.</p>
                <p>We did not do anything to discourage the Iraqis in their pursuit of military
                    means against Iran. I found it interesting to watch the battle for Al Faw.
                    Through various means one could see that the Iraqis had unleashed a major
                    artillery and bomb barrage; suddenly the major, sophisticated, centralized Iran
                    control and command system totally ceased to function. That surprised us because
                    the Iranians had built heavily fortified bunkers which handled all the
                    communications on the Peninsula. Suddenly, those communications ceased. A few
                    days later, one of our Attaches was allowed to visit the Peninsula. When he
                    entered the communications bunker, he found dozens of empty syringes on the
                    floor. That suggested to us that the Iraqis had used chemical weapons as part of
                    their total barrage, focusing the chemicals on key installations. The syringes
                    were standard practice for soldiers who had been gassed. There was no shell or
                    bomb damage, but the installation had stopped operations in minutes. That told
                    us that Iraq had the capacity to use chemical weapons; so we were not that
                    surprised when they used them against the Kurds some time later. We noted that
                    Iraq used this capability in a very sophisticated military way; the chemical was
                    not widely dispersed, but concentrated on key enemy installations.</p>
                <p>The other event which engaged our attention was the unfortunate shooting down of
                    the Iranian airbus. That got a lot of attention. The Iranians came to the
                    conclusion that the attack must have been deliberate; after all the U.S. had all
                    of this very sophisticated equipment on brand-new Aegis-class cruisers that was
                    supposed to be able to distinguish civilian aircraft from military and identify
                    all aircraft in the area. They thought we were sending a very strong signal that
                    we wanted the Iranians to stop fighting with Iraq. What might we do next? Bomb
                    Tehran? Of course, they misread us, but I am not sure that they ever accepted
                    the accidental nature of that event.</p>

                <p>It was clear to me that at the time, Iran was a real threat to the stability of
                    the region. The Iranian power as shown by its war with Iraq, together with the
                    games we had played with that country in recent years, and the Soviet
                    willingness to help the Gulf states made for a very incendiary situation that we
                    were afraid could seriously destabilize the area. Soviet involvement was a real
                    threat. I was concerned by their offer of military assistance to the Gulf
                    states. As I said, it followed the GCC request to us in the early Fall of 1986
                    to which we had never responded, and came at the same time that North's
                    operation with Iran became public. Soviet offers muddied the waters. I felt that
                    in light of all that was going on in the region, we had to send a political
                    signal - i.e. providing more assistance to the Gulf countries, and providing
                    protection to Gulf shipping. Furthermore, maintaining a free flow of Gulf oil
                    was certainly in our national interest going back to the Nixon and Carter
                    Administrations. All of these factors made it essential that we respond
                    positively and rapidly to the GCC. The NSC took the lead, with the active
                    support of Assistant Secretary of Defense Rich Armitage. We first planned how we
                    might assist the Gulf states and then we had to sell the Congress on our
                    approach. There we met considerable skepticism, but eventually we managed to
                    reduce the resistance to the point that allowed Reagan to approve a strong
                    Weinberger-Carlucci-Powell (with the acquiescence of Shultz) recommendation to
                    secure shipping in the Gulf.</p>
                <p>The pre-existing situation was not favorable to our interests. I think that
                    through North's operations, we added significantly to Iranian military
                    capabilities - certainly to their anti-aircraft and anti-armor capacity. In
                    addition, I think that the intelligence we passed to them was also of
                    considerable help. To what degree our assistance helped them in their war with
                    Iraq is hard to say, but the facts were that we had provided a lot of military
                    equipment and intelligence and that the Iranians did enjoy considerable success
                    on the field of battle - even though their military advantage over Iraq was only
                    temporary. It may also have been that our assistance emboldened Iran in some
                    ways; I am sure that they felt that our assistance was a political signal of
                    some kind.</p>
                <p>Therefore, when we began to protect the shipping in the Gulf, the Iranians saw it
                    as a reversal of U.S. policy. The more active we were, the more they were
                    convinced that we had changed policy course and were treating them as the enemy.
                    Of course, there was no change of formal U.S. policy, but I can understand why
                    they felt that way since they had been receiving encouragement from the National
                    Security Advisor and his staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>As far as Afghanistan went in this period, we had there one of our most serious
                    confrontations with the Soviets. Angola, Cambodia, Central America and
                    Afghanistan were the potential flash points in the late 1980s. I think
                    Afghanistan may have been at the head of the list because the Soviet troops had
                    actually invaded that country; they were embattled there fighting the Mujahideen
                    Freedom Fighters, whom we were supporting. The chain of events in Afghanistan
                    started long before I reported to the NSC. Originally, the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan in 1978 was perceived as being linked to the fall of the Shah, but I
                    don't think any of us in 1987 saw a connection between that event and Soviet
                    involvement in the Gulf. Casey was dead by then and no one else had stepped up
                    to take his place as the “interpreter of the Soviet global conspiracy.”</p>
                <p>In that connection, I should mention that starting approximately in 1987, the
                    pressures to use military means to combat terrorism slackened considerable. I
                    attributed this change to Casey's departure as well that oMcFarlane, Poindexter
                    and North. They had a view of the world that most others did not share and they
                    were also conspiratorially minded.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on Afghanistan. I visited that country in February, 1987
                    with Mike Armacost, then the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. We wanted to
                    see what was going on. We met with President Zia of Pakistan and others.As far
                    as Indian and Pakistan were concerned, the relationship between the two was
                    fairly calm in the 1986-88 period. It was true that in late 1986 or early 1987,
                    the Indians and the Pakistanis had become involved in the Indian military
                    exercises called “Operation Brass Tacks” which could have turned into a major
                    conflagration or at least a serious confrontation. Each started a series of
                    maneuvers, which did not end when they were supposed to. In fact, both sides
                    began to buildup infantry and armor along their border. Finally President Zia
                    and [Prime Minister] Rajiv Gandhi managed to diffuse the tensions by agreeing to
                    meet at the border and watch a cricket match together. That stopped the
                    maneuvers on both sides, which was a wise move. We helped that process a little
                    by providing intelligence to both sides which showed that the more alarmist
                    reports from their own intelligence services were exaggerated. When one of those
                    alarmist reports was made and there was increased concern we would get our
                    intelligence apparatus to check it out and usually found that the situation was
                    not nearly as dire as originally described. We would not divulge precisely what
                    the actual situation was, but we would deny that their reports were accurate. I
                    think that helped to reduce the tensions.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>In the 1987-88 period, Lebanon was still in the midst of its civil war. They had
                    reached some preliminary accords, but they were not yet in effect. I must say
                    that at that time, I did not have much optimism about those accords or any
                    others having much effect. I worried about Lebanon primarily as the breeding
                    ground for terrorists. The memory of Lebanon as the country from which our
                    hostages were taken was still fresh in our minds. When I went to work at the
                    NSC, four had been released - in exchange for considerable amounts of weaponry
                    for Iran. In January 1987, four more hostages were taken in Lebanon - making a
                    net gain of zero for the policy of working with the imaginary “moderates” in
                    Iran. Reagan's initial reaction was to try to contact the Iranians once again to
                    see whether they could help us in the release of the latest victims. Both
                    Carlucci and Powell raised objections. They insisted that the last exchange of
                    hostages-for-arms really didn't work and predicted catastrophe at home as well
                    as in the region if we were to try it again. Fortunately, the President dropped
                    the idea. I think this was a clear illustration of the benefits the government
                    derives from having top notch officials, confident and experienced, who are
                    willing to stand up to a President and tell him when he is wrong. When such
                    courageous individuals take a strong stand, most Presidents - Reagan among them
                    - will listen. A couple of years earlier, under a similar situation, the
                    Presidential advisors gave him wrong advice, or Reagan hadn't listened, or they
                    caved in to his gut instincts without taking the time to explain the risks
                    involved. They were not up to the task of providing sound judgement in a way
                    that was meaningful to Reagan. As good military men, I suspect that the former
                    advisors just saluted and said that if that was what the President wanted, he
                    would get it.</p>
                <p>We saw the same syndrome played out when Howard Baker became the [President's]
                    Chief of Staff. It was a welcomed change from the previous approach which was
                    essentially to accommodate the President regardless of potential consequences.
                    Other Presidents also had staffs that did not provide adequate advise. But Don
                    Regan, Poindexter and McFarlane did not have adequate experience - particularly
                    civilian - nor were they sufficiently self-confident to be useful advisors to
                    President Reagan; they could not stop him when he went off into some of his
                    “intuitive” directions.</p>
                <p>I was satisfied that we had adequate time to devote to the major problems of the
                    area under my jurisdiction. That was principally because I had two excellent
                    assistants, as I mentioned earlier - Kelly, Ross, Burns. I don't think we
                    neglected any major issue. We of course were not responsible for policy
                    implementation; that was the responsibility of the departments and agencies. We
                    were primarily concerned that there be sufficient coordination and cooperation
                    among the agencies. In some ways, I regret that South Asia has been divorced
                    from the rest of NEA; I think it may have diminished the importance of the
                    sub-continent in the eyes of high level officials. Bill Burns, who succeeded me
                    in the NSC NEA job, recently confirmed that view; he feels that South Asia gets
                    less high level attention in the Department now that it is in a separate bureau,
                    rather than enhancing it which was the principal reason for the organizational
                    change. I don't think that I or the NSC as a whole would have been more active
                    during my NSC tour on South Asia issues if they had been raised by a separate
                    bureau in the Department. As I said, I believe we adequately covered all the
                    issues in the NEA area in the 1987-88 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I did not spend as much time on the Israel-Arab peace process as I had done
                    during my first stint in the NSC. That was not too surprising because that peace
                    process, given its length, does ebb and flow. It should not be a continuous
                    preoccupation of the American government at all times. What was new during the
                    1987-88 period was the emergence of the [Palestinian] “Intafada.” I remember
                    that very vividly because Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli Secretary of Defense,
                    was in Washington when it first broke out. Colin Powell, Dennis Ross and I met
                    with him for a long time in the Situation Room. We asked him how he intended to
                    proceed; he informed us that he had given orders that the uprising was to be
                    crushed in two weeks' time. We doubted that could be done and said so. We
                    obviously differed on the strength of the Palestinian movement and suggested to
                    Rabin that he better review his policy when he returned to Jerusalem. By the
                    time I left the NSC, the principal problem in the peace process were the
                    Palestinians; Syria and Israel, Jordan and Israel relationships were stable -
                    there would be occasional flare ups, but no prolonged period of tensions. The
                    pursuit of peace in the Middle East is always a desirable goal, but it is not
                    always possible to pursue it with serious results. As long as the situation was
                    stable, we couldn't be terribly worried even if we were not making any progress
                    or making a major effort. I think the U.S. can help make progress from time to
                    time - as we did during my prior service in the NSC which followed the progress
                    that Kissinger achieved right after the 1973 war. This led directly to Camp
                    David and its permanent peace between Egypt and Israel, but even then there were
                    periods of no movement. So there are occasions when major progress can be
                    achieved; it just can't be done all the time. There are times, as in 1987-88,
                    when stability is enough; chasing new agreements may not be useful and
                    furthermore they require an extraordinary effort on the part of an
                    administration which has many other, more immediate problems to confront. Shultz
                    had already been burned by the Syrians for their activities in Lebanon, but even
                    had that not happened, I don't think the Secretary would have felt it wise to
                    take 21 trips to Damascus and spend innumerable hours working on a problem that
                    was not flaring up. Some people get the “Middle East” bug; others don't -
                    regardless of circumstances on the ground. Some Secretaries of State have been
                    preoccupied with the Middle East, whether or not the time was opportune. Baker
                    inherited something that was moving and was able to give it a big push - the
                    Infatada needed to be addressed and he did so, with the impetus of the Gulf War.
                    He then tried to move on to Syria-Israel; which didn't succeed. He did establish
                    some rapport with Syrians which helped reduce tensions, but did not result in an
                    agreement. He used the Gulf War very adroitly to mount support for the Madrid
                    Conference which gave a new impetus to the peace process - something new had
                    happened in the region which spurred participants to new efforts. Of course, the
                    most important question is what is done with a new start in the peace process:
                    can you move ahead or will the parties retreat to their old habits and
                    policies?</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>I believe that if a situation is quiet, there is no reason why a President or a
                    Secretary of State need to devote much time to it. I think that on occasions,
                    they have tended to be too involved even when it was clear that either there was
                    no prospect for progress or there was no indication of any trouble bubbling up.
                    There may be times of course that domestic political pressure requires at least
                    some outward sign of Presidential involvement, but that was not the case for the
                    Middle East peace process in the 1987-88 period. I don't think the political
                    pressure in any case usually comes in a way that necessarily requires
                    Presidential action. In the case of the Middle East again, there was a lot of
                    concern for the Intifada activities, but there was no outcry from the body
                    politic to “do something.” Toward the end of my tour and as we approached the
                    Presidential elections of 1978, Shultz began to take more interest in the
                    Intifada and what lay behind it. The Palestinians sent an emissary to Washington
                    whom I met with as well as Dennis Ross. Shultz indicated interest because the
                    Palestinians were making some sensible proposals - which never got very far. But
                    at least, we started a dialogue with the Palestinians which later on - thanks to
                    courageous recommendations by Shultz and Powell - turned into a limited
                    recognition of the PLO, allowing its representatives to attend international
                    conferences - a new advance.</p>
                <p>I did not intend to suggest in my earlier comments that the elections alone had
                    spurred Shultz to show interest in the Intifada; on the contrary, this would not
                    have been perceived as a “smart” political move. I must say that in my two years
                    at the NSC, we had relatively little pressure from U.S. domestic constituencies.
                    We had some problems with arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab
                    states, but we had no major debates on the peace process.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>There was certainly considerable outcry in the U.S. to do something about the
                    Soviet invasion and continued occupation of Afghanistan. There were some heated
                    discussions within the administration about what course the U.S. should follow.
                    Ronald Reagan personally felt very strongly about this issue. I think there may
                    have been some disconnect between the President and the State Department on this
                    matter, particularly when it came to the so-called “Geneva Accords.” Mr.
                    Cordobez, who was the UN Secretary General's negotiator on Middle East talks and
                    a leading figure in US-USSR talks on the issue, and the Soviet leadership both
                    had a rude awakening in December, 1987. At that time Gorbachev came to
                    Washington for a Summit Meeting. During one of their sessions, Ronald Reagan
                    told the Soviet Premier that the U.S. would continue to support the Mujahideen
                    until the Soviets had withdrawn from Afghanistan and their man in Kabul
                    President Najibullah had been replaced. This came as a great shock. After his
                    return to Moscow, [Eduard] Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, sent a
                    message to Shultz pointing out that Reagan's comments seemed quite inconsistent
                    with the U.S. position as posited by him and by Under Secretary of State Michael
                    Armacost during the negotiations on the “Geneva Accords,” upon which Cordobez
                    had been working. He pointed out that in those conversations, the emphasis had
                    been on the cessation of arms supply from Pakistan to the Mujahideen. The reply,
                    to Minister Shevardnadze which was approved by the President, the Secretary of
                    State and the NSC, suggested that the Soviets had not understood the U.S.
                    position. We reiterated that if the Soviets were to stop the provision of arms
                    to the Afghan regime, then we would try to stop the supply of weapons to our
                    friends in Afghanistan. This position was called “negative symmetry.”</p>
                <p>I think this episode illustrates the communication gaps between the State
                    Department and the Soviets and between the State Department and the White House.
                    The formula of “negative symmetry” - “we stop when you stop” - which we finally
                    developed was the best we could do under the circumstances. After all, the
                    “Geneva Accords” negotiations had been going on for many months; in fact, a very
                    detailed draft agreement had been developed to which we had agreed. The only
                    issues that were unresolved were the time limit to be imposed on arms deliveries
                    by both sides and the length of the Soviet withdrawal period. The agreement was
                    very clear on the question of arms supply from Pakistan: when the agreement was
                    signed, such deliveries would stop. That position had been approved at the
                    working level by the State Department and the NSC staff in 1985, was changed by
                    President Reagan's remarks, the first time he had addressed this issue
                    personally. We in Washington had to scramble for some new language which took
                    some effort because both Reagan and Powell were on the West Coast at the
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>John Negroponte and I drafted the new U.S. position - “Negative Symmetry.” During
                    the January-March period, during the pre-Summit negotiations that took place
                    alternatively in Washington and Moscow, the Soviets kept rejecting the new
                    formula. Finally, in March, the logjam was broken by an agreement which allowed
                    both sides to continue their arms supply programs, or “Positive Symmetry”. The
                    new formulation was acceptable although he and all of us would have preferred a
                    cessation of arms supply. General Powell remarked that had the Soviets accepted
                    “Negative Symmetry” he was not sure that Reagan would have accepted it, because
                    he was absolutely committed to Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. He would have
                    been very reluctant to cut off arms for the Mujahideen - our “friends,” even
                    with the USSR doing the same. The State Department, on the other hand,
                    approached the negotiations in its historical fashion - get an agreement if at
                    all possible. Furthermore, Secretary Shultz was committed to establishing a
                    good, long-term working relationship with the Soviets. Unfortunately, President
                    Reagan's very strong views on Soviet involvement in Afghanistan had obviously
                    not been given sufficient weight at lower levels. There were some situations
                    which did not attract Presidential attention; Afghanistan was not in that
                    category. Reagan cared deeply about getting the Soviets out. Shultz' policy was
                    not on the same wave length with the President, although I don't think the
                    Secretary ever checked it with him - the appropriate occasion never having
                    risen. In fact, I don't think our NSC predecessors had spent much time on the
                    subject. Prior to 1987, Afghanistan was not really a hot issue - there was never
                    an expectation that we could convince the Soviets to withdraw. It was only
                    during the Summit that Gorbachev dropped serious hints that he was considering
                    withdrawal; he was testing the waters to see whether he could get U.S. agreement
                    to a process that would make withdrawal acceptable to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The Soviets had expected all along that we would cease our arms deliveries
                    through Pakistan. I think they were probably not diverted from that view by
                    anything our negotiators might have said. Had our team contacted the White House
                    through Shultz it might have taken a firmer position on arms deliveries and
                    might have diverted the Soviets from their anticipations. So there was a
                    communication gap between the State Department and the White House which in turn
                    probably mislead the Soviets to believe that our policy was to stop arms
                    deliveries as soon as they left Afghanistan. It was only after the
                    Gorbachev-Reagan meeting that the Soviets - and our negotiators as well -
                    understood that the President was firm in his position that our “friends” would
                    be supplied even after Soviet withdrawal. That is when we had to scramble to
                    come up with the new policy of “Negative Symmetry.” The change of U.S. attitude
                    on arm supplies was an interesting exercise. The Department had a few anxious
                    moments and were not at all pleased by developments. It went back to the files
                    and pulled out a 1985 cable, which had been approved by [Don] Fortier of the
                    NSC, which approved much of the text of the agreement. The NSC response was that
                    in 1985, the whole question of negotiating a treaty was pretty much hypothetical
                    because as I said earlier no one believed that the Soviets had any intentions of
                    withdrawing from Afghanistan. Had the Department been thorough, it would have
                    checked again with the NSC and the President when the negotiations were
                    apparently becoming serious.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>In 1987, we wanted to be sure that the Pakistanis would be willing to continue to
                    allow their territory to be a transhipment point for arms to the Mujahideen.
                    Most of the arms came from the CIA and the Pentagon, but had to travel through
                    Pakistan to reach Afghanistan. We had to make sure that after Soviet withdrawal,
                    the Pakistanis would continue to allow us to use their territory. In fact, the
                    Pakistanis were to be the signatory to the agreement along with the Afghans; we
                    and the Soviets were essentially only the guarantors. The Pakistani Prime
                    Minister called Shultz and told him that he was prepared to sign the agreement.
                    We suggested that President Zia of Pakistan call Reagan, which he did. Zia was
                    the single power in Pakistan: the Prime Minister was largely powerless and also
                    appeared to be more eager for an accord than Zia. Thereafter, Reagan sent
                    Carlucci, by now the Secretary of Defense, to visit Pakistan to talk to Zia
                    face-to-face. He wanted to make absolutely sure that there would no
                    misunderstanding particularly on the question of our continued arms supplied to
                    the Mujahideen - even though the Pakistan-Afghanistan agreement included a
                    clause that would have put an end to such supplies. Zia decided that he would
                    sign the agreement anyway - it was going to help him politically at home. When
                    asked how he would handle the arms supply question, Zia said that he would just
                    lie; after all, he had lied to the Soviets for ten years - a few more wouldn't
                    make much difference. He pointed out that in Islamic culture, there was no
                    prohibition against lying to one's enemies. Frank's cable, reporting on that
                    conversation with Zia, had a footnote which said in effect that the Pakistanis
                    had been lying to the Soviets about Afghanistan in the same way they had lied to
                    us about their nuclear program!</p>
                <p>I believe that the Reagan position on arms supply was a carry-over from the long
                    standing position that the President, always fully supported by his CIA chief
                    Casey, had always taken on Soviet issues: fight them everywhere at all times
                    while ultimately ready for an understanding. In the Afghan situation, I think
                    that policy was correct; the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan accelerated the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Communism and the Cold War. The
                    psychological impact on the Soviet Red Army of their defeat in Afghanistan was
                    far greater than the impact of our retreat from Vietnam. I think in this
                    particular case, Reagan's position was far better than the Department's -
                    assuming that the overall policy of forcing Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
                    as part of the termination of the “evil empire” was the correct objective.
                    Dobrynin's view, as contained in his memoirs, was bitter about the American
                    position because instead of helping the Soviets in their transition away from a
                    communist dictatorship it actually destroyed them. As I said, I certainly agreed
                    with Reagan on his general stance against communism. Although I might not have
                    pursued the issue as hard and as far as the Reagan administration did in Central
                    America and the Caribbean, I felt that a hard line was fully justified in
                    Afghanistan because there was a clear case of invasion by the Red Army - not
                    surrogates.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: On August 17, 1988, a Pakistani plane carrying among others U.S.
                    Ambassador Arnold Raphel and President Zia crashed, killing all aboard. We
                    immediately held an emergency meeting to decide how best to handle the
                    situation. That was chaired by General Powell. One of the conclusions was that
                    an immediate replacement for Arnie Raphel should be nominated and sent at once
                    to insure that there be no perceived gap which might be interpreted as a
                    weakening of U.S. support for Pakistan. It was important that there be
                    continuity in our activities in Pakistan, to insure that assistance to the
                    Mujahideen continued, that the Indo-Pakistan relationship did not deteriorate
                    and that internal stability in Pakistan be maintained. Zia had been the sole
                    leader for ten years; he was now gone and we were concerned about what might
                    happen to Pakistan internally.</p>
                <p>Some of Arnie's friends - the Armacosts, the Abramowitzs, the Oakleys and Dick
                    Holbrooke - went to the Palm Restaurant that evening in a tribute to him. While
                    there, I got a call from Secretary Shultz from the Republican National
                    Convention in New Orleans. He told me that he was leading the U.S. delegation to
                    Zia's funeral leaving the following day; he wanted me to be on his plane with
                    two suitcases. I was not coming back because he and the President had decided
                    that I would be the next U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan. I said OK - it was a
                    significant challenge, but did create some family problems. When I returned to
                    the table and told the assembled group what I had just been told, Phyllis asked
                    what that meant for her - she was Shultz's spokesperson at the time. I told her
                    I didn't know; she would have to ask the Secretary. The next day she announced
                    to the press that I had been appointed as Ambassador to Pakistan. The whole 24
                    hours were bizarre because neither Phyllis or I had any idea what fate would
                    bring. We were apart for six months until Secretary Shultz completed his tour
                    and Phyllis remained as his spokesperson. It was not the first time that Phyllis
                    and I had been separated, but I certainly did not relish the prospect.</p>
                <p>I certainly understood the need to replace Arnie as quickly as possible, since
                    Zia's death had created new conditions on the ground that might have been quite
                    deleterious. We had a big stake in Pakistan, both because of Afghanistan and
                    because Zia had promised to hold elections, which we wanted to take place very
                    badly. I was also a known quantity to the Pakistanis, having visited there on a
                    number of occasions. They knew me from my NSC tours; they knew me from my days
                    as Counter-terrorism Coordinator; they knew me from other previous assignments.
                    During my second NSC tour, my brief covered Afghanistan, which had given me the
                    opportunity to visit Pakistan with Mike Armacost. Therefore they knew that I had
                    considerable familiarity with US-Pakistani issues. I think they must have been
                    reassured by my appointment. So I left for Pakistan in August and never came
                    back, even for my confirmation hearings. I was given a recess appointment, which
                    was processed while I was in flight. So by the time we landed, I was the
                    official emissary of the President of the United States. Agrement had been
                    received from the Pakistani government, all in the space of 24 hours. All I had
                    to do when I arrived was to present my credential, which I did a day later.
                    Because the way my appointment was made, I did not have the opportunity, as had
                    my predecessors, to study Pakistan from an academic point of view, nor to learn
                    Urdu.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>I found a high degree of uncertainty and anxiety in Pakistan. No one knew who the
                    perpetrators of the plane crash had been. The remaining leadership was convinced
                    that it was part of a plot which would claim more victims in the forthcoming
                    days. The fear was of course of destabilizing the country. I was instructed to
                    try a) to calm the Pakistani leadership down; b) to insure that the arms
                    supplies to Afghanistan would continue to flow; c) to make sure that the planned
                    elections would take place; and d) that there be no rise in tensions in the
                    Pakistan-India relations.</p>
                <p>I worked on those issues on the Secretary's plane on the way to Pakistan. The
                    CINC of CENTCOM was on the plane; Mike Armacost was there as well and of course
                    Shultz. That was a key core group which reached a consensus on a game plan. We
                    sent warnings to everyone - the Soviets, the Indians, etc - to stay away from
                    Pakistan. We did not feel that the plane crash was part of a general plot, but
                    we had to be sure that no other country would try to take advantage of the power
                    vacuum created by Zia's demise. We told the Pakistanis that we had sent these
                    warnings.</p>
                <p>We tasked the intelligence community to pay special attention to any information
                    it might receive about threats to Pakistan. We told the Pakistanis that we had
                    done that and that we would inform them of any significant intelligence that we
                    might pick up. We despatched a top flight Air Force investigation team to the
                    crash site, along with some State officials. I was able to negotiate an
                    agreement with the Chief of the Pakistani Air Force and the President which
                    allowed our crash team to merge with theirs so that we had a single
                    investigative team. They agreed after I assured them that no reports would be
                    submitted to Washington until after the entire investigation had been completed
                    - so that no separate reports would be filed, which they weren't. Such agreement
                    was just as much in our interest because we also were concerned about “leaks”,
                    particularly of partial results. We too wanted the whole investigation completed
                    before any reports were filed.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>I had no idea of course what had caused the airplane crash. It took me about four
                    days after the arrival of the investigating team - about a week after the
                    accident - that I began to lean towards the accident theory. The team indicated
                    that it could find no evidence - either inside or outside the plane - of any
                    explosion. It of course could not be certain, but sabotage or ground fire did
                    not seem to be the cause. That of course was the opposite of what most observers
                    had believed; initially, most of the speculation was on a missile or a bomb. But
                    the team never found any evidence of that. The team reviewed all the records
                    maintained by the Air Force and Lockheed on C-130s; they found about 20 cases in
                    which the plane porpoised through the air before hitting the ground, as the one
                    that Arnie and Zia were flying on had done. In most of the other cases, the
                    planes had not crashed, but it was entirely possible that this one had done so
                    because it was lower. In most of the earlier cases, the planes were sufficiently
                    high that the pilots were able to recover and land safely. Our team attributed
                    the crash of the Pakistani plane to a) the inexperience of the Pakistani pilots
                    with C-130s and b) the low level at which the plane was flying before its crash.
                    In the previous cases, the fault seemed to lie with the hydraulic system; we
                    believed that that was also the cause of the crash of the Pakistani plane. I was
                    satisfied that the team had conducted a thorough investigation and that the
                    crash was the result of mechanical failure. Until the report came in, I did not
                    feel obliged to lean towards one theory or another. Our intelligence - which is
                    not always infallible - had not picked up any indicators of a plot or any
                    subversive activity by either the Soviets or the Indians or any of the known
                    Pakistani enemies of Zia. Although we couldn't be sure, there was no unusual
                    activity outside of Pakistan which might have suggested a foreign plot. Of
                    course, it was easier for we Americans to be more dispassionate about the event
                    than the Pakistanis. They were very nervous; they were certain that some outside
                    power was behind the plane crash. But they too began to wonder when no foreign
                    action was forthcoming; then they turned to theories of Pakistani sabotage - by
                    the Army or some political opposition. At one point, some Pakistanis even blamed
                    the CIA - a convenient whipping boy. But none of the theories seemed very
                    convincing and there certainly was no sign of any follow-up activity which might
                    have taken advantage of Zia's demise. Tom Clancy, in one his books, attributed
                    the crash to a laser beam emanating from a satellite under the management of
                    some Soviet controllers in Central Asia.</p>

                <p>After the team had reached its conclusions, I had long conversations with the
                    President of Pakistan and the Chief of the Pakistani Air Force. I told both that
                    I could foresee what might happen. Under most circumstances, Americans tend to
                    look at accidents rather mechanistically, and the accident had not involved our
                    President. However, we could nevertheless understand how they might feel. Our
                    evidence was of course not 100% conclusive, but our best guess was that the
                    accident was due to mechanical failure. If the Pakistanis however felt that the
                    cause was something else, the final report should so state. And in fact, that is
                    what the final report showed six weeks later; the Pakistanis maintained that
                    although no definitive proof was available they felt that the accident was the
                    result of a plot by person or persons unknown. The Americans said that we
                    believed that mechanical failure had been the cause.I think you have to remember
                    that South Asia is conspiracy-theory oriented - even more than we are about who
                    killed JFK. It was hard for them to accept the accident theory, particularly
                    since we had no hard evidence to support our findings. I thought therefore that
                    the split conclusion in the final report was the best possible outcome; neither
                    side could definitively prove its conclusion and therefore both sides were
                    satisfied. Eventually, the issue died away.</p>
                <p>I should comment a little about the Embassy staff. It was in a state of shock
                    after Arnie's untimely death. It was a great staff: BetJones was the DCM - she
                    had been handpicked by Arnie and had been at post for only about two weeks. Most
                    of the staff were Foreign Service couples. For example, the Political
                    Counselor's wife was the deputy chief of the Economic Section. The Economic
                    Counselor's wife was the Budget Officer. Beth Jones' husband was the deputy PAO.
                    I think that kind of staffing is a plus; it assuredly was in Pakistan in the
                    late 1980s.</p>
                <p>We all went to work trying to stabilize morale; everybody rallied around and
                    responded in admirable fashion. I did not detect any resentment of my
                    appointment, although I was not comfortable with the circumstances. Arnie Raphel
                    was an extremely capable and popular diplomat; he was an expert and understood
                    South Asia; he knew the language. The Embassy was his. He had picked the
                    leadership personally. It was not an easy situation for the new fellow on the
                    block to move into. But the staff responded as professionals should and pretty
                    soon, we all developed a close bondage and a tight relationship. I welcomed that
                    and it made my tour an enjoyable one.</p>
                <p>I think the staff was satisfied after the investigation that Arnie's death was
                    due to an accident. Fortunately, we were too busy to develop a
                    “bunker”mentality. All of us had too much to do in trying to work with the
                    Pakistanis to assure continuity and stability. The Embassy felt that it was
                    functioning well under severe pressures and it received good support and
                    commendations from Washington, which helped morale considerably. I kept the DCM
                    that Arnie had chosen; it was one of my better decisions. She was invaluable and
                    stayed in Pakistan an extra year after my departure so that the two top Embassy
                    jobs wouldn't be turned over in the same year. In fact, I made no changes in the
                    staff, except those demanded by the usual rotation policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>I did add one position - courtesy of the CIA. Arnie was the only long-time South
                    Asia specialist in the Embassy. During my first consultation in Washington -
                    after having been in Pakistan for about two months - I tried in vain to get from
                    the Department a political officer who really knew South Asia. I had never
                    served in South Asia and I felt we needed more expertise on the staff. Beth
                    Jones was also not an South Asia expert. Apparently the Department did not have
                    an available officer. Of course, Arnie had not needed an South Asia expert
                    because he was the preeminent one in the Service. Ed Abingdon, our Political
                    Counselor, was an excellent officer, but was not a South Asia expert; none of
                    the other political officers were either. Interestingly enough, this was a
                    period during which we also had a shortage of Arabists. These ebbs and flows in
                    personnel occur from time to time. So I asked the Agency whether it would be
                    willing to lend me such an officer; it readily agreed. I got a real crackerjack
                    who worked in my Political Section giving us a depth of knowledge of South Asia
                    affairs that we had been lacking. He was very, very good.</p>
                <p>Bill Clark, our Ambassador in New Delhi, was not a South Asia expert either. But
                    he had people on his staff who had a sufficient depth of knowledge of the area.
                    His DCM and Political Counselor had considerable South Asia experience. Bill and
                    I were old friends and the first thing we decided to work together on was
                    “peace” between our two Embassies. Before us, the two institutions had been as
                    much at each others throats as had the Indians and Pakistanis. We were
                    determined that was not going to continue. We agreed on a program of visits
                    between ourselves and our two staffs. Furthermore, since Pakistan was under the
                    military purview of CENTCOM and India was under PACOM [Pacific Command], we
                    agreed that when those CINCs visited, they would visit both countries; that
                    turned out to be very helpful.</p>
                <p>Pakistan was preoccupied with Afghanistan, supporting the Mujahideen, and of
                    course the Indians had to take the opposite stance - they supported the Soviets
                    as they did on many issues. But relative calm was maintained between India and
                    Pakistan until the Kashmir Intifada broke out in December, 1989. Then the
                    situation deteriorated very rapidly. The Kashmiris revolted, very much like the
                    Palestinians - and essentially for the same reason: no one outside was paying
                    any attention to their grievances. They felt unrepresented politically because
                    Kashmir was governed by a puppet government, installed by the government in New
                    Delhi after grievously rigged elections in which very few participated, and
                    brutally authoritative. So they began violent protests to call attention to
                    their plight.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>By December 1989, the Soviets had withdrawn from Afghanistan and the Pakistanis
                    took much of the credit, since they had supported the Mujahideen. They became
                    sufficiently confident that it started to aid and abet the rebellion, which had
                    been essentially a totally domestic spontaneous event. The Pakistanis
                    erroneously had come to the conclusion that their intervention in Afghanistan
                    could be replicated in Kashmir and that the Indians could be driven from that
                    land. In 1965, they had infiltrated some Pakistani army personnel, loosely
                    disguised as Kashmiris; that incursion had blown up in their face because that
                    was the cause of a war that they lost. After thaPakistan was dismembered in 1971
                    and by the late 1980s they were still determined to get revenge. They still
                    wanted Kashmir - which had not been an issue between Pakistan and India since
                    1965. In 1989 and even today the Pakistanis maintain that Kashmir is the
                    overriding issue between India and itself - without a settlement of that issue
                    there can be no peace on the sub-Continent. But they forget that it was not an
                    issue between 1965 - the end of the war - and 1990 - the year of the Kashmir
                    uprising. But in 1990, some Pakistanis concluded that by waiving the flag of
                    Islam in Kashmir - as they had done in Afghanistan - they could generate enough
                    ferment to force the Indians to withdraw from Kashmir. So they set up an
                    operation which was analogous to what they had done in Afghanistan - with the
                    major exception that we were an integral part of the Afghan operation, but they
                    did everything they could to keep us out of the Kashmir operation. In Kashmir,
                    they set up local religious parties which provided support to the rebels - so
                    that they could not be accused of providing direct support. They assisted in the
                    creation of new political-military movements - in opposition to the regime -
                    which were supported fervently by Islamic fundamentalists. The Indians responded
                    by increasing pressure on Pakistan as well as reinforcing their military in
                    Kashmir. These forces threatened to attack and wipe out some of the Kashmiri
                    training camps, which were located in North Pakistan. The tension began to
                    build.Bill Clark and I reviewed the situation and came to the conclusion that we
                    might be seeing a repeat of the 1987 maneuvers - the famous “Brass-tack”
                    exercise, unless we somehow managed to diffuse the tensions. A military
                    confrontation, with both sides ready to spring, like we had in 1987, could have
                    been an exceedingly unfortunate outcome. Rajiv Gandhi had been replaced by Singh
                    as Prime Minister; he was very weak. Bhutto in Pakistan did not have the stature
                    to control the army. So Bill and I feared that by the Fall of 1990 tensions
                    could build up to a level that might cause armed conflict. Therefore we urged
                    that some action be taken by the U.S. in the spring. We recommended that the
                    U.S. initiate a concerted effort with the Soviets, Chinese, Japanese and the EU
                    countries to have each of those governments bring some pressure on Pakistan and
                    India - in their own way and on their time. We wanted Pakistan and India to know
                    that other countries would not get involved in what all considered to be an
                    unimportant side-show which was not worth armed conflict. The concerted efforts
                    of all the major powers began to have considerable influence on the
                    sub-Continent, so that by the time Bob Gates, the Director of CIA, visited in
                    May, 1990, the tensions had already begun to abate. Both sides used his visit
                    well by using it as an excuse to back off - which they had already decided to do
                    prior to his visit. So Gates' trip was very useful as a cover for both Pakistan
                    and India and to insure that the tensions stayed in abeyance.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>As I said, the Pakistanis and the Indians largely ignored Kashmir for fifteen
                    years before 1990. The Indians were not overly upset by what Pakistani
                    involvement there was in Kashmir during this period. Bill and I checked the
                    records as best we could and found that, despite nine or ten high level meetings
                    between Pakistani and Indian officials during 1989, Kashmir was never raised by
                    either side. Punjab was always mentioned - with India accusing Pakistan of
                    supporting Sikh terrorists - but Kashmir never. But then in December 1989 the
                    Kashmiris themselves started an uprising. Then the Pakistanis became actively
                    involved; they had always carried a resentment deep in their psyche that they
                    had been wronged by partition. That bitterness had been dormant, but the actions
                    of the Kashmiris reawakened those feelings. The Pakistanis felt that they could
                    not ignore events right across their borders. Then it became a very hot domestic
                    political issue - both in Pakistan and in India. In Pakistan, during the 1970s
                    and 1980s, the military dictatorship did not feel a need to respond to public
                    demands. So Zia down-played Kashmir; since there was no political opposition, he
                    could afford to ignore it. But once an elected government took office in
                    Pakistan, Kashmir became a political football - somewhat analogous to
                    McCarthyism and the communist threat or the “loss” of China. Political leaders
                    in Pakistan could not be seen as “soft” on India - as Indian leaders could not
                    be perceived as being “soft” on Pakistan. This phenomenon accentuated the
                    political dispute between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto with recriminations
                    tossed at the one in power about being “soft” on Kashmir. Since Sharif and
                    Bhutto alternated as Prime Minister, one was always accusing the other of that
                    “crime.” That makes settlement of the issue very hard to achieve as long as it
                    is a hot domestic political matter. The Pakistanis, under the political
                    circumstances of the 1990s, as well as the Indians, can not break that cycle of
                    recriminations. If politics in both countries stabilized, then it might be
                    possible to achieve some resolution of the Kashmir issue - if it were not used
                    as domestic political football. Under present circumstances, the issue may heat
                    up again some day - it is a festering problem on both sides.</p>
                <p>The Punjab issue, on the other hand, has been reasonably settled. Kashmir could
                    also be settled if the Indians would permit greater political participation by
                    the inhabitants of the region and greater economic development for that land. If
                    those matters were resolved to the satisfaction of the Kashmiris, then the
                    Pakistanis would have a much harder time keeping the pot boiling. But I don't
                    see the situation moving in that direction; unfortunately, I think both sides
                    are hardening their positions once again and in a couple of years, we may have
                    another crisis. At this time, there are popularly elected governments in both
                    India and Pakistan, who are trying to manage the problem. At the same time,
                    Kashmir itself seems to be calm and the tensions between Kashmir and India seem
                    to be at their lowest level in some years.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Let me turn for a minute to Pakistani economic development. The Indians, having
                    abandoned their socialist economic theory to a large extent, are making good
                    progress. The Pakistanis have not kept up because 1) India has always been far
                    ahead of Pakistan in the level of education and training of its people; 2) India
                    has a much larger middle class and a larger pool of skilled labor - evolved
                    since independence. Pakistan in much of the country is still largely feudal;
                    literacy is far from universal - for women it is about 33%. The educational
                    institutions in Pakistan are far less competent than the Indian ones - both in
                    terms of quantity and quality. As far as I am concerned, education is vital to
                    economic development as we can see from the experiences of the Asian “tigers” -
                    Korea, Taiwan, Singapore - all of which devoted major resources to their
                    education programs. The importance of education is accentuated by the
                    technological requirements of today's world.</p>
                <p>Right from the beginning of her stewardship, we talked to Bhutto about the
                    deficiencies in the Pakistan educational system. She was very interested in
                    education. It just happened that our government had been considering a very
                    large AID-supported education program. Implementation had not yet begun. One of
                    the first matters I asked her after she became Prime Minister was to whom we
                    might talk about educational programs. She gave us the names of her two top
                    aides in this field. We had on our drawing board a program to enhance elementary
                    education in Pakistan. I wanted to get her staff and ours together to work out a
                    joint program. She readily agreed and our respective people developed a new
                    program to overhaul primary and secondary education in Pakistan. It began and
                    was moving along very well until we had to stop all assistance due to the
                    Pressler amendment requirements.</p>
                <p>We used Peace Corps volunteers and contract personnel working in the schools of
                    the rural areas of Pakistan. Many new schools opened; many teachers were
                    retrained. I had high hopes that this program would really modernize Pakistan's
                    secondary educational system. The Pakistanis were enthusiastic about it. But
                    then we had to stop our assistance. The Pakistanis stopped their program as well
                    because they did not have sufficient resources or interest to continue it. We
                    never were able to change the cultural environment in which Pakistan education
                    takes place; they still, beyond the educators, did not understand the importance
                    of education in today's world for economic development and the society's long
                    range blossoming. I don't fully understand their mentality, but it is clear that
                    education is still not adequately rewarded in Pakistan. Furthermore, the
                    military uses up so many resources that there is little left for any other
                    purposes. The lessons that the Indians or the Southeast Asians have learned have
                    not yet crossed the border.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>Taxation was another major economic issue. There were very few Pakistanis who
                    paid taxes-primarily the government employees. No one else paid taxes. Rich
                    landlords - the landed aristocracy - pay no taxes because traditionally
                    agriculture has been exempted from taxation. These landlords are represented in
                    the national legislature by such a large block of votes that it is virtually
                    impossible to change the tax laws. Some small progress appeared on the horizon
                    because Mrs. Bhutto was interested in privatization; she tried to move forward
                    with a program, but ran into opposition from labor groups which were always a
                    major constituency of the Pakistani People's Party. When Sharif took power in
                    1990, he really moved ahead on the privatization program; actually at that time,
                    Pakistan was moving faster in that direction than India. When India talked about
                    such a program, it referred to a sale of 5-10% of state owned corporations;
                    Pakistan talked about 50% and more. Sharif's program was beginning to move while
                    I was still there and that was very encouraging. State corporations were being
                    sold and they were rationalizing the production, making the enterprises viable
                    economic entities. I found that process very interesting. For example, one of
                    our major assistance programs attempted to assist Pakistan's huge water and
                    power monopoly (WAPDA). It ran all the power sources - dams, generation
                    facilities - as well as the power and water distribution systems in the country.
                    Our program had been in effect for many years and had been one of our most
                    important ones. We used it not only to improve the quality and quantity of the
                    service, but also as leverage to try to convince the government to privatize it.
                    We never got very far on the second issue until we stopped all U.S. assistance
                    because of the Pressler amendment. The Pakistanis found that the revenue from
                    the sale of power was not enough to continue to subsidize the government
                    corporation. That forced the government to start to sell off parts of the
                    corporation, using much of the spade work that we had done in the past
                    decade.</p>
                <p>A lot of other privatization has taken place, in part because with the demise of
                    our assistance program the government no longer had the resources to subsidize
                    these state-owned entities. That is really ironical. While we were providing
                    assistance, we did not have sufficient leverage to bring about changes in
                    economic policies in Pakistan. But as soon as our assistance ceased, those
                    changes were forced on the government which used our plans to bring them
                    about.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>I might just talk a little about that period during which our assistance program
                    was terminated. When Bob Gates visited in May 1990, we had just satisfied
                    ourselves that Pakistan had resumed high level enriched uranium production as
                    well as the manufacturing of components for nuclear devices. Those programs had
                    been halted in early 1989, as result of explicit and implicit agreements reached
                    between us and Pakistan. The Pressler amendment required the cessation of
                    assistance if a country had a nuclear device - or all components which could be
                    quickly assembled to make a device. That provision had been added to the Foreign
                    Assistance Act in 1984 after Pakistan had breached the limitations imposed by
                    the Symington amendment on nuclear proliferation. With the acquiescence of the
                    administration, Congress passed the Pressler amendment which made the limits of
                    acceptable nuclear development in countries receiving U.S. assistance much
                    clearer and more definitive. Any country exceeding those limits would lose all
                    U.S. economic and military assistance - with no Presidential waiver authority.
                    That is probably the only law that explicitly denies the President a waiver
                    authority.</p>
                <p>At the same time, as a carrot, Congress authorized a major increase in assistance
                    to Pakistan - up to about $ 600 million per annum. With PL 480 and some other
                    programs - e.g EX-IM [Export-Import Bank], OPIC [Overseas Private Investment
                    Corporation - the total annual U.S. assistance to Pakistan would have been close
                    to $1 billion. So the pot was sweetened considerably. The amendment required the
                    President to certify that Pakistan did not have a nuclear device or all the
                    components thereof.</p>
                <p>In the Fall, 1988, the Administration had said that we were not sure that
                    Pakistan was in compliance with the requirements of the Pressler amendment -
                    there was a major dispute on this question within the administration. The
                    Administration's intelligence did not fully confirm that Pakistan had exceeded
                    the limits set by Pressler. ACDA thought that it had crossed the line. CIA
                    wasn't certain. President Reagan decided to give the Pakistanis the benefit of
                    the doubt. We did insist that free elections be held and that the winner be
                    allowed to take office. The certification, required by the Pressler amendment,
                    was delayed until December - after the Pakistani election. Assistance was
                    suspended from October 1 to December. The predominant view in the administration
                    was that certification could not be provided until after the election, which we
                    hoped would be free and from which the winner would be allowed to take office.
                    The majority of Congress did not object to this procedure, although there were
                    some of course who thought that the Pressler amendment should be enforced
                    immediately. Among that latter group was Senator [John] Glenn [Democrat, Ohio],
                    who told Armacost and me that he thought that the Pakistanis had exceeded the
                    limits and therefore he would vote against any further assistance to that
                    country. But he did say that he would not lobby other members to support his
                    position because he recognized that it would probably be a mistake to cut off
                    the assistance - both in terms of sustaining the war in Afghanistan and of
                    non-proliferation. He thought that the cutting off of assistance might in fact
                    encourage the Pakistanis to accelerate their nuclear development program.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>Both Reagan and Bush - outgoing and incoming Presidents - wrote letters to the
                    President and Prime Minister of Pakistan, which I personally delivered to the
                    addressees and I also gave copies to General Beg, the Chief of Staff of the
                    Armed Forces. Both letters said in effect that the Pakistanis should cease and
                    desist completely from any further work on their nuclear device. General Beg
                    visited the U.S. in January or February, 1989. He talked to General Powell - the
                    outgoing NSC Advisor - and General Scowcroft - the incoming NSC Advisor - and
                    others. He concluded that Pakistan's best interests would be served by imposing
                    a freeze on its nuclear program. That would allow the large flow of U.S.
                    military assistance to continue, as well as economic assistance. I think also
                    the Pakistan military did not see any imminent danger from India in early 1989;
                    that took off pressure for any immediate nuclear device development program.
                    Finally, Pakistan needed us because the war in Afghanistan was still on-going.
                    The Pakistanis froze their nuclear development program allowing Mrs. Bhutto
                    during her summer, 1989 visit to the U.S. to announce to the U.S. Congress that
                    uranium enrichment was down to 5%. Our intelligence confirmed her statement.
                    That made everyone happy.</p>
                <p>By early 1990, Indo-Pakistan tensions rose again because of Kashmir. The war in
                    Afghanistan was well under Mujahideen control. General Beg, with the
                    acquiescence of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, decided to reactive the nuclear
                    program - doing precisely what we had asked him just a few months earlier not to
                    do. By May, we knew for sure that the program had resumed. When Bob Gates
                    [Deputy NSC Advisor] arrived, we took the opportunity to raise the issue with
                    the President when the three of us met privately. We told him that we knew that
                    Pakistan had done exactly what it had been told not to do. We said the same
                    thing to the Prime Minister and General Beg. We told all of them that they had
                    to stop. Nothing happened. In the spring and summer, I met with all three of the
                    Pakistani principals at least once a month, separately. I reiterated again and
                    again that we knew what was going on and we knew that no steps were being taken
                    to cease and desist.</p>
                <p>I emphasized that unless the nuclear program was frozen again, all aid would be
                    cut off on October 1. I was open about what we knew. I expanded my circle of
                    interlocutors beyond the “Big Three”. I tried to enlist the Chief of Staff of
                    the Air Force, other military men, two or three other politicians. I warned all
                    of them. I told the Chief Air Marshall that the U.S. would be unable to deliver
                    his new F-16s. No one would believe me - because despite all our past threats,
                    we had always found some way to keep the assistance flowing. No one would do -
                    or could do - anything. Some would deny - unconvincingly so - that Pakistan had
                    a nuclear development program. Each would suggest that I see someone else. But I
                    kept repeating my message - over and over again. I told the Pakistanis that
                    George Bush was not Ronald Reagan. Bush would be much more careful about
                    adhering to Congressional requirements. He was much more straight forward. I
                    advised the Pakistanis to read our domestic situation very carefully and not to
                    be misled by history. I also noted that the Cold War and the Afghanistan War had
                    ended and that therefore Pakistan's strategic importance was not the same as it
                    had been just a couple of years earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>Pakistan had in 1990 a good many senior and mid-career military officers who had
                    been trained in the US. We had an ever improving military-to-military
                    relationship. A few officers, like Beg and his immediate entourage were caught
                    by nationalistic fervor. He looked toward other Islamic countries, like Iran, as
                    potential allies. That was unusual in Pakistan where Islamic fundamentalism was
                    practiced by a small minority. But Beg and his people came up with a wonderful
                    theory that if the U.S. attacked Iraq after the Kuwait invasion, Iran would join
                    with Iraq and the two of them would take care of the U.S. One December 1990
                    evening, at midnight, Beg's intelligence chief called me to invite me to come to
                    Beg's house. That was the first time he had spoken to me since the invocation of
                    the Pressler amendment. He obviously wanted to impart some thoughts to me but
                    didn't want anyone to know that he had talked to me. What he told me - and what
                    he wanted me to report to Washington - was that if the U.S. used force against
                    Iraq, the Iranians would attack us. I told him I disagreed strongly with his
                    analysis, but he was convinced of his views. He had even devised a strategic
                    theory - which we later managed to acquire - which postulated that the U.S.
                    would incur large losses in the Gulf and would thereafter retreat from the area
                    - as we had done in Lebanon many years earlier after the Marine barracks was
                    blown up. Beg predicted that all of the countries with which we had amicable
                    relations - Egypt, Saudi Arabia, etc. - would be totally discredited, leaving a
                    leadership vacuum in the Islam world, which would be filled by Iran and
                    Pakistan. But I hasten to add that this totally skewed perception of the world
                    was shared only by Beg and a small group around him. The rest of the military,
                    especially those trained in the US, knew better. Beg became Chief of Staff only
                    because most of the senior Pakistani generals were killed aboard Zia's plane.
                    Beg was in a unique situation, which unfortunately is becoming more common, as
                    fewer and fewer officers are U.S. trained - none since 1989. It is one of the
                    consequences of cutting off our ties to the Pakistani military.</p>
                <p>But I got nowhere in the summer and fall of 1989 with my warnings of the aid
                    cut-off. The tensions with India had increased - the Pakistanis always accused
                    us of letting them down whenever there was a confrontation with India.
                    Furthermore, the President of Pakistan, the Prime Minister and the Chief of
                    Staff of the Pakistani Army had had a falling out. The Chief of Staff was trying
                    to get rid of the Prime Minister. The two of them were not on speaking terms.
                    Any decision on the nuclear program required the approval of the President, the
                    Prime Minister and the Chief of Staff. That required communication between them.
                    In the original decision to resume the program, the President and the Chief of
                    Staff had agreed and Bhutto had gone along because she was afraid that she would
                    be deposed if she had not. Eventually, that is what happened anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>I was “allowed” to interrupt my home leave in mid-September to return to Pakistan
                    with another letter from President Bush to the Pakistani President, announcing
                    that our assistance program would be terminated on October 1st because the
                    Pakistanis had not terminated their nuclear development program. I had
                    volunteered to deliver the letter since I preferred to perform that chore myself
                    rather than burdening the Charg� or anyone else. For the rest of 1989 and most
                    of 1990, I had to live with this new impediment to U.S.-Pakistan relations. The
                    delivery of that letter was a unique experience in my life. It was a very
                    uncomfortable experience which I did not perform with any great relish. I gave
                    it to the President; I told him that I had talked to him about this eventuality
                    for months. He was shocked and most upset because he, like most of the Pakistani
                    leadership, never expected the U.S. to take such drastic action. Then we began
                    to discuss actions that might enable Bush to reverse his decision. I told the
                    President that I couldn't of course make any promises and that any proposed
                    course of action would require the approval of both the Executive and
                    Legislative Branches of our government. After I delivered the letter and spent
                    three or four days in Islamabad, I returned home to finish my home leave. The
                    Pakistani government did not release the letter so that the press and the public
                    were really unaware of our decision until October 1 when our assistance programs
                    were stopped entirely. In fact, as I remember it, the first public announcement
                    of our action was made by some Congressmen - the supporters of
                    non-proliferation.</p>
                <p>Then the Foreign Minister, Yacub Khan, - a wonderful man - talked to Secretary
                    Baker at the UN in October, 1990. Since I was still on home leave, I
                    participated in that meeting. The two had frank discussion during which Khan
                    outlined the actions that Pakistan could take - i.e. re-freeze the program. But
                    the Pakistan government would not agree to destroy what it had already built.
                    That was not acceptable.</p>
                <p>My conclusion, after living through this most difficult time, was that the
                    Pakistanis badly miscalculated the situation in Washington. They believed that
                    they could resume their program without retribution. Furthermore, I think that
                    they really believed that another conflict with India was a distinct possibility
                    - in the near future. It is true that the Indians were responding strongly to
                    Pakistani provocations - and that must be noted. The Indians were reacting to
                    Pakistani provocations and even though Pakistan was concerned by possible Indian
                    actions, they would have been in retaliation to Pakistani actions in Kashmir. So
                    the Pakistanis could hardly be considered innocent; Indian reactions were in
                    response to provocations.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In March, 1990 the Chief of Army Staff went to Tehran. He and I always had good
                    relations. Upon his return, much to my amazement, he told me that he had
                    returned “very reassured.” In puzzlement, I asked “Reassured by what?” He said
                    that he had been afraid that Pakistan would have been in trouble had war broken
                    out over Kashmir. But in Tehran, he heard the Iranians promise Pakistan their
                    full support and that made him feel more confident. With Iran's support, he was
                    sure he would win a war against India. I looked at him dumbfounded. He repeated
                    that Pakistan would win. I asked whether that meant that his forces would occupy
                    all of India - a very large country. That query upset him. I then asked which
                    Iranian had been his host. It had been the head of the Revolutionary Guards. I
                    asked him whether he had seen his counterpart in the regular army. He said “No.”
                    - General Beg wouldn't see him, which I found very interesting because I had
                    heard from the Chief of the Pakistani Air Force that when he went to Tehran two
                    months earlier, he had met his counterpart, from the regular Air Force - not the
                    Revolutionary Guard Air Force - had had a very good meeting with him and had
                    established good relations with the Iranian Air Force. In that case, the
                    Pakistani Chief Air Marshall wanted nothing to do with the Pakistani
                    Revolutionary Guard Air Force. The head of the regular Air Force had asked the
                    Pakistani what he might able to do to reestablish some US-Iran military contacts
                    so that the Iranians would not be forced to go to Moscow for their military
                    equipment - a move that the Iranian general said would be a last resort, but one
                    that he might have to take if he could not open a channel to the US. That came
                    to naught but it was an interesting look into Iranian attitudes. Beg dealt only
                    with the head of the Revolutionary Guards.</p>
                <p>When General Schwarzkopf CINC of the Central Command visited Islamabad in April
                    1990, he brought with him the head of his intelligence unit. He told Beg that he
                    had been advised of my conversation with him after his Tehran trip. Schwarzkopf
                    said that he didn't know what the Iranians would or would not do for Pakistan in
                    the event of a war with India, but he had brought his assistant chief of staff
                    for intelligence to brief the Pakistanis on Iranian capabilities. Beg said he
                    didn't want that briefing; he couldn't trust what the U.S. military would say.
                    He was convinced that Iran would assist Pakistan and together, the two would
                    take care of India.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>Right from the beginning of my tour, one of the techniques I used to improve
                    US-Pakistan relations - in part by reassuring the Pakistanis that their nascent
                    democratic political process could continue without concern of outside
                    interference - was to increase military-to-military cooperation. We accelerated
                    the delivery of end items that were in the pipeline - like self-propelled
                    howitzers, helicopters, naval vessels, etc. Under normal procurement practices,
                    much of this equipment might have taken as much as three years for delivery. We
                    managed to get it delivered immediately. Our Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the
                    Air Force paid extended visits to Pakistan in 1989. The Pakistani Navy Chief of
                    Staff spent a prolonged period in the U.S. General Yeosock, who later commanded
                    U.S. ground troops in Desert Storm, came to observe Pakistani military exercises
                    and gave some advice. More Pakistani officers went to the U.S. for training. So
                    we worked very hard to establish a close military-to-military relationship and I
                    think it was a very successful program. Prior to this time, the close
                    relationship had only existed between the Air Forces; by the late 1980s, we had
                    done the same thing for the Armies and the Navies. That program became one of
                    the serious negative consequences of Pressler; it had to be completely halted on
                    10/1/90 when the President could no longer certify that Pakistan did not have a
                    nuclear device or components.</p>
                <p>The aftermath of aid suspension was very uncomfortable for all of us in Pakistan.
                    The Pakistanis did not seem to understand why “the U.S. had deserted” them. They
                    pointed out that they had provided invaluable assistance to us in Afghanistan;
                    they would not believe that it was sheer coincidence that the invocation of
                    Pressler and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan happened at about the same
                    time. They linked the two events and accused us of terminating relationships
                    once their assistance in Afghanistan was no longer required. It was almost
                    impossible to dissuade people from this point of view, even those to whom I had
                    been talking for months warning them of the potential risks Pakistan was running
                    by resuming its nuclear program. Most Pakistanis did not understand why we had
                    not forgiven them this time, as we had in the past; they linked this to the
                    Afghanistan developments. I think those Pakistanis who had a good understanding
                    of their country's nuclear development program, had little comprehension of the
                    potential difficulties the pursuit of that program held for US-Pakistan
                    relations. As I said, in the summer, I did my best to enlarge the circle of
                    influential policy makers to try to impress the dangers upon as wide an audience
                    as I could quietly reach. My hope was to explain that the consequences of
                    Pakistani policies would be very serious and detrimental and to try to bring
                    some pressure on the President, the Prime Minister and the Army Chief of Staff.
                    It didn't work.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>We tried to get our point of view across as actively as we could after October 1.
                    We didn't rush out to brief the press, but we did talk to as many Pakistanis as
                    we could. Ultimately, just before my departure, I held a large press conference
                    and gave a long interview to a newspaper editor - Mrs Maleeha Lodhi, now the
                    Pakistan Ambassador to the US. I met fifteen or twenty editors in Lahore in the
                    week preceding my departure. I went to great lengths to explain why the U.S. had
                    terminated assistance. I made the point that Pakistan deliberately had passed
                    the limits of U.S. laws; it had been fully and repeatedly warned; the U.S.
                    should not be condemned for Pakistan's actions and the resulting consequences. I
                    added that part of the problem was that Pakistan's nuclear activities were so
                    sensitive that only a handful of officials were aware of the full extent. The
                    leadership knew what might happen - I had told them often enough; so they knew
                    the possible risks and had chosen to ignore them. In a better democracy than
                    Pakistan had, if the National Assembly and the media had been more aware and
                    involved, the outcome might have been different. But since the information was
                    so tightly controlled, there was no check on the few policy makers, and only
                    inadequate discussions of both the nuclear program and the potential deleterious
                    consequences. I suggested that the Pakistanis had considerable work ahead for
                    them to insure that such catastrophic policies could not be carried on in the
                    future. The politicians, the media and the people had to acquire more
                    information and more influence to prevent episodes of the kind that we were
                    going through. My emphasis was on the need for Pakistan's democracy to grow
                    beyond just the popular elections which they were already holding.</p>
                <p>I don't think that the Pakistani Embassy in Washington was in the loop. I am not
                    sure that it sent warning signals. If any one did, it would have been the
                    Ambassador, but I suspect that he was not involved. Only the Foreign Minster had
                    knowledge of the nuclear program, and that was only because he had been one of
                    Zia's confidants - otherwise, he too would have been in the dark. There were no
                    conversations that I am aware of in Washington with the Embassy comparable to my
                    missionary work in Islamabad. Frankly, much of what I did in Pakistan in the
                    summer of 1989 was on my own initiative. The issue was so sensitive - in terms
                    of how we collected the information - that most people just didn't want to deal
                    with it. I was frank with the Pakistanis about what we knew - never how we knew.
                    No one told me to stop talking to the Pakistani leadership; so I continued, even
                    though I suspect that some people in Washington were not totally comfortable
                    with my program. In addition to my own efforts, of course there was Presidential
                    letters, letters from the Secretary of State, a visit by Bob Gates, etc.</p>
                <p>But I think the Pakistanis were determined to proceed with their nuclear
                    development program. General Beg was a unique person with a unique vision of the
                    future and he was the “project leader.” The President was a disciple of Zia. The
                    Prime Minister, as I mentioned earlier, was concerned about the backlash that
                    any opposition from her might create. Furthermore, there was considerable
                    Pakistani pride involved. They had manufactured a device, even over the
                    opposition of the rest of the world. Their position was bolstered by the fact
                    that the Indians had a device; they could not understand why the world would
                    allow India to have it and not Pakistan, which they felt, was in mortal danger
                    from India.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>I have always wondered that if we had signed a defense treaty with Pakistan,
                    which would have been operative in case of an Indian aggression, whether the
                    outcome might have been different. I have no way of proving that, but I think it
                    might have changed Pakistan's direction. From a Pakistan perspective, it would
                    have seemed totally irrational to give up a nuclear capability in light of the
                    perceived Indian threat, their lack of a U.S. security guarantee and in light of
                    U.S.-Soviet antagonisms and Soviet support for India. For Pakistan to have done
                    what we wanted it to do would have been comparable to France giving up their own
                    force de frappe [French: strike force] - which it would never have done, even
                    when under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. We never accepted the Pakistan position,
                    in part because the administration was constrained by the Pressler
                    amendment.</p>
                <p>I should say a couple of words about [Benazir] Bhutto. I found her very much
                    influenced by her father. She tended to emulate her father's political approach.
                    She was inexperienced, authoritarian - as he had been insecure - although she
                    would undoubtedly deny it. Her male dominated world was bound to have an effect,
                    which she tried to repress. She was also very vengeful - she always referred to
                    actual or perceived damage had been done to her, her family, her father, her
                    followers. She used that as a rationale for taking action against her enemies.
                    That was also her excuse for such activities as corruption - “my enemies
                    practiced it; why shouldn't I?” There was a change in her position when the
                    general charge of corruption - which I was able to discuss with her - was
                    replaced by specific allegations about her husband. When that happened, it was
                    the end of our dialogue on corruption. She then began to deny the existence of
                    corruption. Before the specific charges, we at least had discussions about
                    corruption; they were not satisfactory because they just led to a lot of
                    rationalizations, but at least there was a dialogue. I always told Bhutto that
                    without even looking at the moral issue, the political reality of corruption was
                    that at some stage, it would backfire on her; the people would hold her
                    accountable and take their retribution. But as I said, when the issue became her
                    husband, then there was total denial about the existence of corruption. And that
                    stance continues, even today.</p>
                <p>She was fiercely defensive about her husband. She was terribly in love with him;
                    she could never deny him anything. And he took and takes advantage of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>We talked about many things, both at her initiative and mine. She felt very close
                    to the U.S., particularly her friends in Congress and people like Peter
                    Galbraith. I had not known her before, and I was not nearly as close as Peter
                    and some members of Congress were. She felt that the U.S. was her protector; she
                    certainly gave people the impression that that was the case. One of my moments
                    of enlightenment - which showed that I had not listened to my better judgement -
                    came during one of the times she was having a very bad time with Nawaz Sharif,
                    the Chief Minster of the Punjab and the leader of the opposition. She asked me
                    to take a message to him, which in essence was a message offering
                    reconciliation. She said that she was prepared to meet him more than half way;
                    she wanted to end the squabbling between them for the benefit of the country. I
                    first asked Mrs. Bhutto whether she really wanted that message delivered. She
                    said “Yes.” I then asked whether I really was the right messenger. Her response
                    was that there was no one else that she and Sharif both trusted. I suggested
                    that many people around her didn't want to see a rapprochement between her and
                    Sharif. She said she knew that, but nevertheless she wanted to proceed.</p>
                <p>I then made the same comment about Sharif's entourage. She said that she knew
                    that there were many around him who opposed rapprochement, which was one more
                    reason for her decision to ask me to act as intermediary. She then repeated her
                    request for my involvement. I had serious doubts about this as an appropriate
                    role for a U.S. ambassador. But Bhutto kept asking. Finally, I came to the
                    conclusion that since our official policy was to assist the duly elected
                    government of Pakistan to succeed, Bhutto's request fell into that framework. It
                    was a rationalization. In fact, I made a serious mistake which got me much too
                    deeply involved in the internal affairs of another nation.</p>
                <p>I told her that I didn't know whether her hopes for a rapprochement could ever be
                    realized. She had a lot of opposition to her goal within her own political
                    family. But I said I would deliver the message, which I did. About a week later,
                    I met her again. Then she told me that she had decided that Sharif had to go and
                    that she had sent someone to the Punjab to finish him off politically by ousting
                    him as Chief Minister. I was flabbergasted. How could anyone send a message of
                    reconciliation to a person one week and the next week try to eliminate him? But
                    that was Bhutto! Unfortunately that unpredictability was part of her modus
                    operandi; this event was not an exception.</p>
                <p>I was told of a cable from Ambassador [Tom] Simons [U.S. ambassador to Pakistan
                    from 1995 to 1998] reporting on a conversation he had with the present
                    President, Sardar Leghari, in which the latter remarked that he had to get rid
                    of Prime Minister Bhutto (for the second time). I had to laugh because it
                    sounded very much like the conversation I had with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
                    in 1990; he had made exactly the same comments about Bhutto as his successor had
                    - authoritarian, wilful, corrupt, unbending, unwilling to listen to advice,
                    stubborn. Bhutto seems to get worse and worse; she is not growing. That is
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Let me make some more comments about Afghanistan. As the U.S. Ambassador to
                    Pakistan, I was very much involved in both policy and operational issues. Our
                    operation was run by my Station Chief. I didn't know everything that was going
                    on. But I knew enough to be comfortable and to be able to make a contribution. I
                    didn't always agree with some of our actions, but I realized that that debate
                    over policy would have to take place in Washington. Decisions about actions were
                    made in Washington, not in the field.</p>
                <p>One disagreement I had was with the State Department's general stance which was
                    to seek compromise with the Soviets rather than pursue our efforts in
                    Afghanistan with full vigor. CIA on the other hand, under the “Casey doctrine,”
                    wanted to push the Soviets very hard. That difference of objectives caused some
                    very interesting debates in Washington. I had told Armacost, before leaving for
                    Pakistan, that my views of what U.S. actions should be might be different than
                    those previously espoused by Arnie Raphel. I said that in light of my NSC
                    experience I might not agree with State-only ideas; I thought that a better
                    inter-agency process had to be instituted so that when I received instructions
                    under the signature of Secretary Shultz, I could be confident that behind them
                    stood a unified U.S. government. There had been enough confusion already among
                    various agencies about U.S. policy in Afghanistan. As the senior U.S. official
                    in Pakistan, I would have to tell all agency representatives in Islamabad what
                    our policy was and expect all of them to follow it. That was the approach I
                    followed. I had two or three telephone calls from State officials, asking me to
                    put an end to something CIA was doing or to get the CIA to do something else. My
                    answer was always: “Send me a cable with instructions, showing inter-agency
                    clearance.” I didn't mind instructing the Station Chief to do something or to
                    desist from doing something, but I certainly could not do it without knowing
                    that the issue had been discussed and resolved in Washington first. The
                    questions were primarily about strategy and policy; that is a matter for
                    Washington to decide.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I had a very strong feeling that we were quite correct on our
                    Afghanistan policy - i.e. support of the all Mujahideen leaders to make sure
                    that they fought the Soviets and not each other. That view was not universally
                    accepted. The Pakistani Foreign Minister, for example, was reluctant to provide
                    support to some of the more radical leaders; I thought that as long as the war
                    was being prosecuted, all leaders should receive support. I was concerned that
                    unless they were all supported, the ones that were left out might attack their
                    Mujahideen colleagues rather than the Soviets. In fact, after the end of the
                    war, that is exactly what happened.</p>
                <p>Once the war was over, it was my view that both we and the Pakistanis should
                    drastically reduce our assistance to the real radicals. We didn't need them any
                    longer. With the war over, it was time to work for a compromise among the
                    Mujahideen and a more moderate policy. But the CIA couldn't or wouldn't get its
                    Pakistani partners in line; so we continued to support some of the radicals.
                    None of us really foresaw the major consequence that took place later - the
                    Afghan terrorists who spread throughout the Moslem world and contributed to
                    blowing up the World Trade Tower in New York.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>The present situation in Afghanistan - fighting between the Taliban and other
                    segments of the anti-Soviet coalition - was partly foreseen. We recognized that
                    it would be very difficult to find an accommodation among the various factions.
                    During the last 18 months in Pakistan, I spent a lot of time trying to get the
                    Afghan factions to reach some political deal. By early 1990, they were
                    skirmishing with each other; that is, heavy fighting, as occurred later, had not
                    yet broken out. But it was not possible to get a consensus partly because the
                    radicals, who were only too glad to fight on our side against the Soviets, would
                    not agree with our goals after the war. They were major actors in Afghanistan
                    who continued to receive support even after the Soviets had withdrawn. In that
                    respect, I thought CIA was wrong. But it was never quite clear to me whether the
                    Agency was unwilling or unable to convince the Pakistanis to suspend aid to the
                    radicals.</p>
                <p>I had another problem with the Agency. I could not get it to report on the
                    narcotics traffic in Afghanistan. The Department in Washington could not get the
                    Agency to work on this problem. I think this was because the liaison
                    relationship that the Station had with the Pakistani intelligence services.
                    Everyone knew that narcotics were being grown and exported from Afghanistan. I
                    kept asking the Station to obtain information on this traffic from its sources
                    inside Afghanistan. They denied that they had any sources capable of doing so.
                    They could not deny that they had sources, since we were getting information on
                    weapons and other matters. I never did get a satisfactory answer to my
                    inquiries. I even raised the matter with Bill Webster, the head of the CIA.
                    Never got a satisfactory answer. Nothing ever happened. The same people who were
                    fighting the Soviets were also profiting from the narcotics trade. I suspect
                    that the Pakistani intelligence services may have been involved and that CIA was
                    not going to rock their relationships over this issue.</p>
                <p>These were the major issues on which I and CIA differed. But overall, I was quite
                    satisfied with the support I was receiving from the Station. I had enough
                    information to work with. One of my functions was to assure coordination between
                    the overt, public AID assistance programs for Afghanistan - over $200 million
                    per annum - and the covert, secret CIA programs. I had to make sure that the two
                    didn't stumble across each other. I had to know who was assisting whom, what
                    were the secure areas which were out of bounds for overt assistance, etc. I was
                    the only one in the mission who could perform that function - the AID Director
                    wasn't cleared and the Station Chief was uncomfortable having too much
                    information about the overt assistance program. So I would sit down with each
                    and insure that there would be no overlap. I think it worked quite well, in part
                    because we had an excellent AID Director for Afghanistan, Larry Crandall.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>In general, for most of my tour, we viewed Pakistan as an important ally. During
                    my tour, its importance to us changed somewhat. In early 1990, Bob Kimmitt, the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs, came to Pakistan as part of a tour he was
                    taking throughout the region. He did a superb job explaining to the Pakistanis
                    that our priorities were changing in light of changing nature of the Cold War
                    and US-USSR relations. He emphasized that the U.S. would be placing an
                    increasing emphasis on human rights, non-proliferation, narcotics, democracy,
                    regional stability and economic development. He gave the Pakistanis high marks
                    on all of those issues - but this was before the India-Pakistan tensions over
                    Kashmir and the resumption of the nuclear program. He said that we wanted to
                    work with Pakistan to rebuild Afghanistan. He praised the Pakistani leadership
                    for its initiative in democracy and even said a couple of nice things about
                    Pakistani efforts in the narcotics area, although they had a long way to go
                    before we could be satisfied. On non-proliferation, at the time, Pakistan had
                    frozen its nuclear development program and had agreed to bring their uranium
                    enrichment program to a level below weapons grade. As long as the Pakistanis
                    focused on these issues of importance to us, Kimmitt predicted that our
                    relationships would continue close. So we were relatively satisfied with
                    Pakistan efforts in all areas of concern to us. Kimmitt urged them to continue
                    on their path because if we found them changing their position in any of the
                    areas, then there would be troublesome times in our relationships.</p>
                <p>What Kimmitt was doing was drawing a road-map for Pakistan which would enable us
                    to continue close relationships with that country even as the Cold War was
                    coming to a close. It was a masterful performance. At that time, the Pakistanis
                    seemed to accept Kimmitt's perspective; they understood what was happening and
                    what they would have to do to maintain a close relationship with us. But by
                    three months later - May 1990 - we discovered that they were changing their
                    program by engaging in just those activities which we had warned them would be
                    unacceptable and had discontinued efforts which we encouraged.</p>
                <p>I think that the Pakistani military really were concerned about a potential clash
                    with India over Kashmir. At the same time, they were not as concerned about us
                    as they should have been. It is true that we had turned a “blind eye” to their
                    nuclear program in the past. Furthermore, I believe that in light of the Soviet
                    withdrawal from Afghanistan, the military concluded that our assistance was not
                    as important as it had been.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>I mentioned the insertion of Islamic fundamentalism into Kashmir, partly as a
                    rallying point for the Kashmiri fighters. In general, I view Islamic
                    fundamentalism as a country-by-country phenomenon with considerable networking
                    throughout the Muslim world. This networking was facilitated considerably by the
                    Afghan war. I saw that development analogous to the Spanish Civil War, when the
                    Communist and Socialist parties throughout the world sent volunteers to Spain;
                    that was a boost for Communist-Socialist networking and the Comintern -
                    [Communist International] - which unlike the Muslim world, in fact became the
                    central guide for Communist world-wide activities. Much of the Islamic
                    networking centers on exchange of information; there is also some exchange of
                    personnel. I have never seen any evidence of a central coordinating mechanism.
                    In some cases, the fundamentalist aggression was perpetuated by individuals; in
                    some cases, by small groups; in other cases it was larger groups. But a lot of
                    the fighting happened inadvertently when Islamic radicals - activists, fanatics
                    - congregated in Afghanistan because they all wanted to be part of the jihad to
                    get the Soviets out of that country. The influx of all of these fighters into
                    Afghanistan just happened spontaneously; we didn't plan it, the Pakistanis
                    didn't plan it - it just happened. It is true that the Iranians and the Saudis
                    were busy recruiting and arguing about which country was doing the most to rid
                    Afghanistan of Soviets. But there was no over-all plan. Much of the Afghanistan
                    activity was based on pure fervor which spread throughout the Muslim world. That
                    Islamic drive continued even after the Soviet withdrawal in part because the
                    religious drive did not calm down and in part because the region was filled with
                    young men who had been involved in some heady activities and knew nothing
                    besides fighting. Some were pure soldiers of fortune who knew nothing except how
                    to fire a weapon and how to use explosives. Some were also religious fanatics
                    which gave them an impetus and incentives.</p>
                <p>I think that the use of religion to achieve political objectives is hardly a new
                    phenomenon in world history. It is certainly not restricted to the Muslim world.
                    In a milder version, we find it now in the U.S. with the Christian Coalition
                    which Ronald Reagan exploited so adroitly. The Catholic Church in Poland was an
                    indispensable supporter of Solidarity against the Soviets. We can go back to the
                    Crusades as another illustration of religion being used for political
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>I might just say a few words about Pakistan-China relations. This was not an
                    issue of great concern to us in the period 1987-1990 because the Pakistani
                    nuclear program had not passed the point of no return. Nor had China provided
                    any missiles by then. So we did not have a major problem during my tour. Chinese
                    assistance had been a problem during an earlier period when they provided
                    Pakistan assistance in the nuclear technology and design areas. And of course,
                    the relationship became a problem later in the 1990s, but it was not such when I
                    was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the Pakistan-Iranian relationship was of great interest. Since
                    the public disclosure of Iran-Contra, our contacts with Iranians were severely
                    limited. The Pakistanis were helpful in providing us with their insights into
                    Iranian affairs. I think they were good observers and for a while we used them
                    actively. We used them as a conduit to the Iranians - in addition to the Swiss,
                    the official channel - the Japanese and the Germans. The Bush administration
                    eventually made the correct decision and limited the contacts with Iran to a
                    single channel. The Iranians were very clever in their use of multiple channels;
                    they confused us and kept us off balance. But during my tour, we did use the
                    Pakistanis as one channel to Iran, primarily using the very capable Foreign
                    Minister, Yacub Khan. I have already mentioned my conversations with the
                    Pakistani military about their dialogue with their Iranian counterparts. That
                    was part of our efforts to look into Iran.</p>
                <p>I should not close my discussion of my tour as Ambassador to Pakistan without
                    mentioning Mrs. Bhutto's firing in August, 1990. When Chairman of the Foreign
                    Relations Committee Senator [Claiborne] Pell [Democrat, Rhode Island], came to
                    visit Pakistan in August 1989, he sensed a shift in Pakistani politics. Pell had
                    been a friend and strong defender of Bhutto, Sr. He had done his best to get
                    Zulfikar Bhutto out of prison, or at least to save him from execution. In 1989,
                    he told me that he didn't like what he was sensing in Pakistan; he wanted to
                    talk to Mrs. Bhutto. So we called on her, together with Peter Galbraith - who,
                    as I indicated earlier, was a close friend of Mrs. Bhutto. I was not sure what
                    Pell would say in this meeting and neither was Galbraith. Bhutto was accompanied
                    by her mother and three close advisors. She began to explain her vision of the
                    Pakistan of the future. After an hour or so, Pell congratulated her on her
                    presentation, but noted that it would take a long time to reach her goals. He
                    said he hoped that Bhutto would be in power as long as Queen Victoria had ruled,
                    but he thought that the way she was using her office she would not last as Prime
                    Minister through the end of 1989. That came as a total shock; she had just
                    arrived at the pinnacle of her power. He told her that compromise and consensus
                    building were the key essences of a democratic process - not authoritarianism.
                    Bhutto was completely stunned, knowing that the comments were coming from a
                    friend.</p>
                <p>But she did not change her behavior. By August, 1990, the entire country was fed
                    up by her. The President had had enough, as well as a lot of her own people. The
                    President, under heavy pressure from the Army, used his constitutional powers to
                    remove her from office. I was surprised by the tactics, not by the fact. And now
                    it has happened again, in precisely the same circumstances. As I noted earlier,
                    when I heard about Ambassador Simons' report on Bhutto's latest demise, it
                    occurred to me that I could have written the exact same report 16 years earlier.
                    She was categorized by the President as authoritarian, wilful, stubborn,
                    corrupt. Neither father or daughter seem to learn from experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1991, you decided that the time had come for you
                        to retir.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: That is right. Ten years as a Career Minister is the limit in the Foreign
                    Service. I might have been able to stick around, but I thought it was time to
                    find other challenges. I worked for a year for Sam Lewis, the President of the
                    Institute for Peace. That was fun.</p>
                <p>One the day before Thanksgiving 1992, the phone rang. It was my old boss, General
                    Powell. He asked me to go to Somalia because the U.S. was preparing to launch a
                    large military operation and the administration wanted someone who could
                    represent the President together with a Marine General, Lt General Johnston.
                    Powell told me that CENTCOM was going to provide military support for an
                    international relief operation, UNITAF. He said that I had had good relationship
                    with that command while I was in Pakistan. I also knew Somalia from my previous
                    assignment as Ambassador there. He said that he knew me and had confidence in me
                    and hoped that I would take the job. I told him to talk to Phyllis first (she
                    was the senior deputy in INR at the time). I reminded him that the last time he
                    drafted me - to go to Pakistan - it caused a few family problems. He asked: “Do
                    I have to talk to her again?” I said: “Indeed you do! As a matter of fact, she
                    is walking through the door right now.” So I put Phyllis on the phone. She said:
                    “Colin, you can have him indefinitely with one proviso: our son is getting
                    married in San Francisco on the first of January. He has to be there for the
                    wedding.” Powell agreed. So off I went.</p>
                <p>The first thing I did was to talk to Frank Wisner, the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. I wanted to get some feel for the situation. I had had
                    nothing to do with Somalia since I had left Mogadishu in 1984. We agreed that I
                    should attend a UN conference on humanitarian efforts in Somalia to be held in
                    Addis Ababa the following Monday. That that would be the best place for me to
                    catch up quickly on what was going on inside the country. I got on a plane and
                    flew to Addis. When I left, no one in Washington knew exactly when the military
                    operations would commence. But in Addis, it struck me that if I tried to return
                    to Washington, the Marines might well launch their attack and I would be out of
                    country. That didn't seem to make much sense; so I decided to head for Mogadishu
                    directly from Addis. I wanted to prepare the Somali leaders and others who would
                    be affected for the military operation.</p>
                <p>We had a task force in the Department headed by Frank Wisner to support our
                    efforts in Somalia. Brandon Grove was the Executive Director, with David Shinn
                    serving as deputy. The task force was set up in the best State tradition: when
                    you have a problem, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs sets up a task
                    force. It did take care of the inter-agency coordination problems and I found it
                    very useful in that role. The Pentagon, AID, State and the NSC were represented
                    on it. I think the Somalia task force did quite well and was very useful.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>That task force was abolished when Admiral John Howe went out to become the
                    Special Representative for Secretary Boutros Ghali in March 1995 because Somalia
                    had become a UN responsibility. When I returned from Mogadishu, I found that the
                    Somali desk officer was the only officer in State working full time on Somalia,
                    yet we had 5,000 U.S. troops there. I went to George Moose, the Assistant
                    Secretary for Africa, and said that Somalia needed more attention. There was no
                    inter-agency coordinating mechanism. I thought that the absence of that
                    mechanism had contributed to the difficulties we were having in Somalia. I told
                    him that I knew the task force had been abolished, but I noted that so many
                    things were happening in Somalia that at least David Shinn should be assigned to
                    work on Somalia full time, in addition to the desk officer. The Department
                    needed more senior personnel; otherwise, it was bound to drop a few balls.
                    Fortunately, the Department put David to work on Somalia; later he became the
                    Office Director for East Africa. The Department had totally abandoned all
                    special attention to Somalia, returning responsibility for a very active period
                    of diplomacy to one lonely desk officer - relatively junior at that. As I
                    understood it and said earlier, once the Somalia problem became a UN
                    responsibility, the U.S. lost interest since it was no longer in charge. Also
                    Administrations had changed and in the absence of any crisis, the Department
                    moved on to other matters. The fact that we still had 5,000 military men and
                    women in Somalia did not seem to have attracted much State Department attention.
                    There ensued an abysmal lack of coordination among Washington agencies.</p>
                <p>So in October 1993 when called back to work on Somalia again, by President
                    Clinton, I recommended that a task force be set up by Peter Tarnoff, Wisner's
                    successor, comparable to the one that had existed in 1991. But the powers in the
                    Department decided that they didn't want to do that. I was asked whether I would
                    take on the assignment as Coordinator - pulling the various elements of the
                    bureaucracy together. I said that I would not be the coordinator; that was an
                    on-going responsibility which the administration had to learn how to do on an
                    on-going basis. The new appointees had to learn how to coordinate the activities
                    of the various departments and agencies. I insisted that I was just a short-term
                    fix; that the longer run problems had to be faced by the new officials in
                    charge. I thought that a task force under the State Department's Under Secretary
                    was a tried and true method, but there could be other mechanisms. It helped that
                    Frank Wisner was by this time over in the Pentagon. He and Tarnoff and Dick
                    Clarke of the NSC discussed the matter and eventually they devised a
                    coordinating mechanism, called the Executive Committee, which reported to the
                    Deputies Committee - a part of the NSC system. That Executive Committee was
                    co-chaired by Dick Clarke and Jim Dobbins, who was brought back from RAND; he
                    was well known for his ability to manage processes and to get things done. He
                    didn't mind telling people what to do and making sure it was done - something
                    that the State Department had seemingly forgotten how to do. Both Clarke and
                    Dobbins were a little abrasive, but they were good managers with a proven track
                    record. They started to task people on a daily basis and followed up to see what
                    action had been taken. This was entirely different from the situation that had
                    existed only a few weeks before. It worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>The same system was carried over when the Haiti problem arose, with Clarke and
                    Dobbins remaining as co-chairmen. The Executive Committee concept was different
                    than the task force operation under Brandon Grove. The task force was a State
                    Department operation; the Executive Committee was a joint State-NSC mechanism.
                    In addition to the Ex-Comm, there was a Special Representative for Haiti located
                    in the Department with a small staff similar to my role for Clinton on Somalia.
                    In neither the Somalia case or the Haiti one, were the geographic bureaus the
                    primary actors, although still important cogs. Also the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs was not as directly involved as had been Frank Wisner. In
                    other words, what was established in 1993 was substantially different from
                    previous coordinating mechanisms. I won't judge which system was the most
                    effective, but the Executive Committee concept together with the Special
                    Representative did diminish to some extent the authority of the State
                    Department, particularly the regional bureaus. In the NSC, a comparable
                    situation arose because Clarke [who was senior NSC director for terrorism,
                    crime, and counternarcotics] took over from Jennifer Ward, the senior NSC
                    director for Africa. She was not a major player on Somalia. The same held true
                    for Haiti.</p>
                <p>When the Bosnia situation needed attention, this process was not used. [Dick]
                    Holbrooke [then Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs] and his
                    counterpart in the NSC would not allow the establishment of an Executive
                    Committee or a Special Representative. They viewed Bosnia as a problem for the
                    regional bureau and approached it in that manner - in a much more traditional
                    State manner. I think Holbrooke and his NSC counterpart ran into some
                    difficulties because EUR - and all regional bureaus - had lost crisis management
                    capabilities. So if a regional bureau is to exercise its responsibilities, it
                    must be staffed with some people who know how to manage crises - as well as
                    knowledge of the substance of an issue. My view is that the Bosnia operation
                    suffered and continues to suffer from the lack of coordination. I am a firm
                    believer that some kind of inter-agency mechanism is necessary when the U.S.
                    government is faced with a crisis overseas. The nature of the mechanism is not
                    nearly as important as the goal of insuring participation of all the players in
                    the government.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't want to go over ground that you have covered so well in the book
                    “Somalia and Operation Restore Hope” which you wrote with John Hirsch. There are
                    however a couple of issues which I would like to cover a little more. While you
                    were in Somalia, did you have a sense of personal danger? I would also like to
                    have your views about the efficacy and the politics of having U.S. troops under
                    U.S. command..</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Let me also suggest that anyone interested in the history of this period
                    that they read Brandon Grove's article in the Foreign Service Journal as
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>In answer to your question, I did not have a sense of personal danger. There were
                    people who worried about my safety, but I was not among them. I had two security
                    officers. The only time I felt afraid was on February 27 or 28 when Aideed
                    sponsored some major demonstrations in Mogadishu. He felt that we had
                    deliberately planned to allow his arch enemy, General Morgan, to enter the city
                    of Kismayu. The demonstrators congregated around our compound and then I felt
                    some anxiety. I debated whether to move to the military compound. I consulted
                    General Johnston about that. I told him that I was most reluctant to move
                    because to do so would have given Aideed a psychological boost. I told the
                    General that I preferred to have our troops pay close attention to our compound
                    while I told Aideed that he would be held personally responsible if anything
                    happened to me. Johnston agreed and Aideed paid attention. I didn't have any
                    trouble. In fact the Somalis were very careful about getting near our compound.
                    They usually stayed as far away as possible; especially after two of Aideed's
                    guards were shot dead by U.S. Marine sharpshooters late at night when they
                    inadvertently wandered near the compound.</p>
                <p>As for your second question, the first comment I would make is that there was a
                    myth articulated by many, which was allowed to be expressed without challenge by
                    the administration because it didn't want to deny it and thereby accept
                    responsibility. That myth was that the U.S. combat troops who took casualties
                    were under UN command. In fact, they never were. Republicans kept the myth alive
                    because they thought it was a great political debating point with which they
                    could attack Clinton. Their theme, often repeated, was that President Clinton
                    had put U.S. troops under the command of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary
                    General of the UN. Therefore, he was responsible for their death. They knew
                    better since there had been open Congressional hearings on the issue. But it
                    turned out to be a good issue because their allegations were not set straight.
                    For two years, I kept urging my friends in the NSC to have the administration
                    acknowledge publicly that U.S. troops had always been under U.S. operational
                    control and command in Somalia. The White House refused to make that statement,
                    even though it was factually correct. I assume that the administration did not
                    want to admit that since the troops were under U.S. control, their death was the
                    responsibility of the U.S. commanders or to the Commander in Chief and not the
                    UN. I heard President Clinton acknowledge in private to the Congressional
                    leadership, on October 7, 1995 that the troops were under U.S. command and that
                    we had made a terrible mistake leading to the death of some of them. He said
                    that we had learned from that experience and that steps had been taken to avoid
                    repetition. The Congressional leaders were impressed by this candid admission;
                    they decided to let the March 31 deadline for troop removal from Somalia stand
                    rather than reducing it to December 1 as Senator Byrd wanted.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>There were public hearings both by the House and the Senate Armed Services
                    Committees. The commanders of the two U.S. components, Generals Montgomery and
                    Garrison, appeared and testified that the troops were under their command. The
                    chain of command went from General Hoar, CINC CENTCOM, to General Montgomery who
                    wore two hats: a) UN deputy commander and b) Commander U.S. forces, Somalia. The
                    two-hatted arrangement was the source of some confusion. From Montgomery, as
                    Commander, U.S. forces, Somalia the chain went to the U.S. combat troops. There
                    were some U.S. logistic forces in Somalia under the UN command; they were
                    totally out of danger.</p>
                <p>There was a second contingent of U.S. combat troops who arrived in late August.
                    That was the DELTA Force, Task Force Ranger - the one that got into serious
                    trouble on October 3 and 4 - with 18 deaths and 78 wounded. That contingent was
                    under the command of General Garrison from Ft. Bragg. They reported
                    independently - i.e. not through Montgomery - to General Hoar. So we had two
                    independent combat forces in Somalia, both reporting to CENTCOM - one directly
                    and the other through General Montgomery. It is important to note that neither
                    was under UN command. The early October operations were kept secret from the UN
                    which was the principal reason that the UN forces could not lend a hand when the
                    U.S. troops ran into trouble. We were so concerned about potential leaks about
                    our plans that we kept the UN entirely in the dark, unable to give assistance
                    when it was really needed. So the October operations were entirely a U.S.
                    operation, but no public mention of this was made for a long time. As I said,
                    the Republicans were perfectly happy to foster the myth because they saw it as
                    helpful politically. That myth became especially virulent after October 3 and
                    4.</p>
                <p>Finally, the last debates that Clinton and Dole held in 1996, the President
                    finally admitted that U.S. forces were always under U.S. command. I thought this
                    statement should have come much earlier. If the President or Ambassador Albright
                    were not willing to make it, then the question should have been referred to
                    General Powell, who would have set the record straight.</p>
                <p>I might just say a few words of the role of the media in Somalia. When the media
                    - much of it was “first string;” e.g. Ted Koppel, Christiane Amanpour, etc. -
                    first arrived I asked Brandon Grove what I was supposed to do. He talked to
                    Frank Wisner who checked with the White House. The orders were that I was to
                    cooperate as much as possible with media, including appearances on as many
                    programs as possible. The administration wanted as much coverage as possible
                    because the pictures that came back to the U.S. helped sell the administration's
                    Somali program. Then I wanted to know if there was a particular line to follow.
                    I was told to say anything I wanted; the White House and the Department felt
                    comfortable that I would say the right things. General Johnston asked the same
                    questions through his channels and got the same answers.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>So he and I would appear frequently, sometimes on the same day and on the same
                    program. My staff was also very good in providing background information to the
                    media. We were quite open and fully cooperative as were our U.S. military
                    counterparts. I believe that this strategy paid off. The American people were
                    not surprised by events in Somalia; we warned them about the dangers out there
                    and told them what we were trying to achieve. I think they supported us. I
                    relearned one lesson which was taught by the Tet offensive in Vietnam: a country
                    can lose a war as easily in the media, or easier, than on the battlefield. If
                    you make one major mistake with the media, you will pay because it will
                    eventually reflect a diminution of support from the American public. Therefore,
                    I learned that in a situation like Somalia, the administration must develop in
                    advance a media strategy as well as a military and political one. There also has
                    to be a public information [program] for the indigenous population - what the
                    military calls PSYOPS [psychological operations]. A good local information
                    strategy can be very helpful; I think it worked well for us in Somalia. We
                    worked very hard on the media, both U.S. and local. That was a major part of our
                    task. It paid off. My political officer met every day with the military
                    specialists, in Psychological operations and together they decided upon the
                    messages for our Somali-language newspaper and radio station.</p>
                <p>It was clear that the media had a major impact on turning U.S. policy around.
                    Until August 1992, the U.S. had been the leading opponent in the Security
                    Council to any active UN role in Somalia. But when the pictures appearing in the
                    U.S. media of the starving children and of the miserable living conditions began
                    to penetrate the American consciousness, the political heat was turned up. I
                    think they moved the conscience of the President. He was always concerned by
                    humanitarian suffering; and with the support of the American people he decided
                    that the U.S. should take a much more active role. Congress was in full support,
                    even though the final decision to intervene in Somalia was made while Congress
                    was out of session. By early 1993, it was clear that Congress supported a more
                    active U.S. role in Somalia. The question of U.S. humanitarian assistance is a
                    matter that needs very careful consideration. In Bosnia, we actively encouraged
                    the UN to provide humanitarian protection although we were not willing to be a
                    participant in the UN Force (UNPROFOR). The mission shifted from humanitarian to
                    political without anyone noticing it. That slippery road eventually led to
                    serious trouble, requiring U.S. intervention. The Security Council, led by the
                    US, had given the UN Force objectives which it did not [have] the forces to
                    achieve. The Bosnia operation cost the UN considerable support in the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>In Somalia, I have mentioned that the UN was blamed for the deaths of the 18
                    American soldiers. The Somalia effort also started as a limited humanitarian
                    operation - as President Bush wanted - but was enlarged considerably by the
                    Clinton administration. It became a different kettle of fish, a political
                    operation, without sufficient understanding of the political ramification of an
                    expanded, more intrusive effort. Pretty soon, there was the inevitable backlash
                    from the Somalis, led by Aideed and we paid a heavy price. So one has to be
                    careful before one undertakes humanitarian efforts. Any administration must
                    understand the linkage between humanitarian and political and military
                    activities. All factors must be taken into account before any operation, benign
                    as it may appear, is started. I think that before undertaking a humanitarian
                    rescue, it must be admitted that the effort will not solve the root causes of
                    the misery, unless we are willing to put up very large military and financial
                    and civilian assistance resources over a long period of time. I think that that
                    would be very debatable. Somalia was a very good lesson.</p>
                <p>When the decision was made to assist Haiti, the administration carefully studied
                    two previous operations: Panama and Somalia. They learned from the mistakes in
                    both places as well as from the successes. In Somalia, one success came because
                    I preceded the troops and was able to talk to the local leadership before the
                    arrival and was able to convince them that they didn't really want to resist us.
                    As I said before, it was not planned that way, but it fortunately happened in
                    that sequence. They might have offered resistance had I not been there; they
                    were very nervous and afraid and may have reacted without thought. I teased
                    Colin Powell after he and Jimmy Carter and Senator Nunn visited Haiti. He said
                    he had just done what he had learned from my Somalia efforts. I laughed and said
                    that I did in Somalia exactly what he wanted me to do.</p>
                <p>In both Somalia and Haiti, we had overwhelming force. That discouraged any local
                    adventurism. We had the right mixture of political presence and strategy and
                    military presence and strategy. That worked well. I have already mentioned the
                    PSYOPS in Somalia. That was a success, as it was later in Haiti. We managed to
                    limit our operation in Somalia. There were some that wanted us to get involved
                    in disarming the local population and in other political activities. We resisted
                    because we were anxious to avoid trouble if we could.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>We kept all of countries in the coalition with us for the duration of our
                    operation in Somalia. That was an accomplishment. There were no political splits
                    nor any friction on the ground. In the UNOSOM II period, that took place later,
                    some schisms did appear. Then the Italians, well publicized, and the French,
                    less publicized, took the position that they had never agreed to fight Aideed or
                    other Somalis and refused to obey the orders of the UN commander. We didn't have
                    any problems like that because we conducted good political liaison and
                    consultations. Among the military, the cooperation was very good. There was a
                    Marine major or colonel attached to each of the national units and they had
                    liaison officers at our headquarters. I went around to see each of them
                    frequently, as did our political officers. That kept everyone on the same page.
                    Also, President Bush and Secretary of Defense Cheney maintained liaison at the
                    political level with troop contributors.</p>
                <p>As I said, we did limit our objectives. We were not interested in running the
                    country. We considered that, but well remembered Vietnam and did not want a
                    repeat of that situation with Americans behind each official in their
                    government. We were also careful not to get involved in the Somali civil war,
                    having learned from our bitter experiences in Lebanon. There, the U.S. came to
                    be seen as a party to the civil war, and the result was the bombing of the
                    Marine barracks. So Somalia already represented a “lessons learned” scenario.
                    Now a lot of people say that we didn't solve the fundamental problems of
                    Somalia. My answer is always that that was not our goal. And I think we were
                    absolutely correct in making our engagement In Somalia highly limited. I don't
                    think we have the knowledge or the sustained will to solve other nations' basic
                    problems. We are having difficulty in Haiti despite our massive effort, but we
                    are very careful to let Haitians make as many decisions as possible. We have
                    come to understand the limits of our power. Even if the Haitians are doing
                    things differently from what we might have done, we are letting them do things
                    for themselves. Haiti had a governmental structure; we just helped bring it back
                    to life. Somalis had none. But I suggest that Haiti is an exception to our
                    preferred modus operandi. Haiti is so little and we are so big; Haiti is so
                    close and therefore perhaps greater involvement in that country's affairs than
                    we would have preferred is acceptable. There is some progress in Haiti; it is
                    slowly improving, although far from great.</p>
                <p>In Cambodia, and other key governments, we realized we were in over our heads.
                    The U.S. didn't have the will nor did the international community to pour in the
                    necessary resources. The country was a long way away. So we all agreed in effect
                    to hold elections and withdraw rather than take on the Khmer Rouge. I think that
                    was the right decision. The situation in Cambodia is not great, but it is better
                    than it used to be and that is enough for me. We should never be in the middle
                    of a situation such as Cambodia; we don't know enough and we can't sustain the
                    necessary degree of involvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>I think that had we understood the limits of our power, the Clinton
                    Administration Somalia plan might have gone better. But the U.S. was already
                    started in Somalia, in a period when “nation building” was in vogue.
                    Transforming authoritarian states into democracies was high on the Clinton
                    agenda. All of our goals were well intentioned; we were very idealistic. The
                    days of the UN had arrived; multilateralism was in and the world was going to be
                    saved. I think what happened in Somalia was that for some reason, the Secretary
                    General of the UN thought that the U.S. would continue to be in charge. We had
                    set up a UN operation - through the Security Council - but many UN officials
                    believed that the U.S. would continue to run things - in the name of the UN. The
                    U.S. military on the other hand, was anxious to leave Somalia. The military
                    decisions to draw down reached under President Bush were never challenged, much
                    less countermanded by the Clinton administration. So U.S. forces were
                    considerably drawn down. The Clinton team tried to get other countries to fill
                    the military gap, but was not successful. The numbers were smaller; the troops
                    of our allies came slowly and without the military capability that the departed
                    U.S. troops had had. And they certainly did not have the same psychological edge
                    with the Somalis. The UN - the Secretary General in particular - didn't really
                    understand what was happening; i.e. that the U.S. was no longer in charge and
                    didn't want to be. The U.S. certainly didn't think we were in charge. People in
                    the Pentagon will tell you that they saw what was happening on the ground in
                    Somalia, but they also realized that no one in uniform wanted to return to that
                    country to take charge. On the political level, the Security Council was
                    approving a larger and larger role for the UN - more intrusive and broader
                    mandates - , but no one took the time to see whether the military resources were
                    available to carry out the new mandates. There was a huge discrepancy between
                    tasks and resources. Neither the Secretary General or the Security Council
                    examined this discrepancy. The SC kept authorizing more and more tasks, but no
                    one ever came up with the necessary military resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>I think that, subconsciously at least, every one was relying on Uncle Sam, which
                    had successfully carried out its mandate until the UN took over. When that
                    happened, the U.S. military decided that it was no longer in charge or
                    responsible. It was a situation where the UN thought we were in charge and we
                    thought the UN was in charge. John Howe got caught in the middle. He was a
                    distinguished retired U.S. admiral, a former director of the State Department's
                    Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, a former deputy NSC Advisor, who had been
                    nominated by President Clinton and appointed as the UN Special Representative by
                    Boutros-Ghali. He viewed Howe as his man to make sure that the U.S. did what he
                    thought the U.S. should do. Most other observers also viewed Howe as wearing two
                    hats: a) the UN one and b) as an informal “eyes and ears” of the U.S.
                    administration. In fact, Howe did talk to the NSC every day - he talked more to
                    the NSC than he did to the UN headquarters. The policy in Somalia as expressed
                    by the White House and the UN Secretary General was the same: an assertive, very
                    active UN role in Somalia. All of this was happening at the beginning of the
                    Clinton administration, when “gays in the military” was the hot subject. There
                    was almost a complete breakdown between the political civilian and military
                    leadership in the Pentagon.So we had a disconnect between the UN and the U.S.
                    and a disconnect between the American civilian and military leadership, as well
                    as between the Bush administration people and the Clinton people. That was
                    obviously a recipe for catastrophe. We did not repeat that mistake in Haiti;
                    there the UN resolution which established a U.S. force also provided for a
                    follow-up UN force. Five months before the UN force was to assume the
                    peace-keeping role in Haiti, a 60-man planning group was sent to Haiti to insure
                    a smooth transition. And that was done barely one month after our troops had
                    landed. So in Haiti we did it right - we learned from Somalia.</p>
                <p>I might just end my comments on Somalia with a general observation about a recent
                    evolution of U.S. foreign policy, as represented by our interventions in
                    Cambodia, Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. Unconsciously, I think we moved into new
                    phase of U.S. foreign policy. I think that in some cases, we have over-extended
                    ourselves. In certain instances, we may have been too harsh on the UN. On the
                    other hand, we and the UN have learned some lessons - some the hard way through
                    failures. On occasions, we and the UN have been overly ambitious but I do
                    believe that there is more unrest in the world since the end of the Cold War.
                    The Cold War had a peculiarly artificial stabilizing effect on the world. With
                    the U.S. leading the charge for democracy, that has stirred up popular desires
                    in foreign countries. At the same time, governments have been weakened by
                    international cooperation, modern communications, NGOs, multinational
                    corporations, etc. All of these factors - the end of the Cold War, the desire
                    for greater individual freedom, the weakening of central governments - have
                    converged. Ethnicity and religions become more important; they have become
                    political tools. We are confronted with new challenges and are seeking new means
                    to maintain international order, within states, not so much between states.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>It is not the first time that we have faced this problem - witness the
                    establishment of the Congress of Vienna, League of Nations and the UN. There are
                    a lot of people who have been and are searching for the magic formula to
                    maintain world order - the “alchemists.” I don't think a magic formula for
                    conflict resolution and maintenance of world order will ever be found. No piece
                    of software or anything else will ever take care of all the problems. There are
                    many organizations and individuals who believe they have the answer. I doubt it.
                    But every one is looking for solutions and, consciously or unconsciously, a much
                    higher priority has been given to trying to deal with this major problem of
                    disorder within states - half humanitarian, half political. We will never deal
                    with all threats to stability nor will we be successful in every instance, but I
                    see nothing wrong with trying. There are some military colleagues who consider
                    our involvement in Somalia, Cambodia, Haiti, Bosnia as very dangerous because
                    they see those situations as distractions from the principal goal of preparing
                    to deal with a major conflict. Of course, they can not point with any certainty
                    to a potential major conflict, but they assume that there will be one some day.
                    I don't think there is a flash point on the horizon - unless we really mess up
                    our China policy or the North Korean situation. In any case, if there is such a
                    situation, our military will have enough time to get its readiness back by
                    pulling its resources out of peace-keeping operations and devoting them to
                    preparing for a major conflict. The quadrennial defense review will deal with
                    that issue; I'll be interested to see how it is resolved.</p>
                <p>I think whether we like or not, the U.S. and the rest of the world have and will
                    have to pay more attention to humanitarian problems. We are developing better
                    criteria which will define more sharply what we will engage in and what we will
                    stay out of and how deeply and for what length of time. We may have some
                    criteria already, but they have been unconscious and too vague. Nor have they
                    been articulated. But we must get involved in some humanitarian situations - it
                    is part of our tradition. The rest of the world has come to the same conclusion.
                    I have attended a number of meetings in the last two years with representatives
                    of our allies and friends; I find that the military of these countries are eager
                    to be involved in humanitarian operations. They like it. They think it makes
                    sense as a military mission. They want to be careful, but they recognize that it
                    validates the necessity for a military. It also gives them a task, which is not
                    always easy to come by when there is no war. And it gives them credit.</p>
                <p>In addition, when the UN can afford it, it pays the less developed countries for
                    the use of their military. That eases their budgetary requirements. We gain an
                    advantage because it increases the military-to-military relationships. We
                    sometimes train their troops and other countries like that. All of that gives us
                    contacts that might be useful in a combat situation or a future peace-keeping
                    operation. The reaction of foreign military leaders towards peace keeping and
                    humanitarian assistance has been much more positive than ours. We are still
                    arguing about whether participation is a positive. The Marines are enthusiastic;
                    they fight forest fires, they assist local police forces in case of riots, as in
                    LA; they help the border patrol on the Mexican borders. So peace keeping is not
                    a major leap for the Marines. They helped the Kurds; they went to Somalia; they
                    went to Haiti. They like it.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>Some Army officers are afraid that if they get involved in small operations, they
                    will not be ready for a big one, should it ever come along. My comment to the
                    Army has always been that it will be involved in small operations, whether it
                    likes it or not, because the Commander in Chief will periodically order them to
                    do so. So they might as well prepare for that certainty. But some of the Army
                    officers would prefer to fight the inevitable because they really don't want to
                    participate and perhaps if they squawk enough, they believe that perhaps they
                    won't be dragged into these operations as often as they might have. So within
                    the U.S. military there is a division of views. In addition to the strategic
                    question, there is of course the budgetary one because if the military decides
                    to take on peace keeping willingly, then allocations might have to be adjusted
                    by reducing resources devoted to heavy armor and increasing those going to light
                    infantry forces or combat engineers or civil affairs or special forces - all
                    essential for a low intensity operations.</p>
                <p>As I said earlier, we learned lessons in Vietnam and in Central America during
                    the Cold War period. Those were lessons that are applicable to the operations we
                    are conducting today. In both situations, our strategy and tactics were dictated
                    by a mixture of political and military goals - unlike a major war which is
                    essentially overwhelming military at least at the beginning.</p>
                <p>I think we are in a transition period in foreign policy in terms of recognizing
                    what our role in the world should be. I don't think we will develop an
                    over-arching strategy, which some of our great theorists keep pushing -
                    nostalgically. Our goal will be as always to protect U.S. interests, which means
                    essentially protecting security and economic relationships that we have built up
                    in the last fifty years. The military is a part of maintaining this web.
                    Secretary of Defense Perry's idea of preventive defense is a good one. I also
                    believe that as long as we don't face a major opponent - such as the Soviet
                    Union used to be - that we will continue to move from one crisis to another.
                    Historically, in the last ten years, public opinion, sometimes led by the White
                    House, has pressed administrations to be involved in peace keeping and
                    humanitarian assistance efforts - sometimes quite unexpectedly. Some
                    administrations have taken the position that they would not get involved only to
                    be forced to do so by the force of public opinion. And the world expects U.S.
                    leadership and involvement.</p>
