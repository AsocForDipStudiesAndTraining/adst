                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 29, 1992. This is an interview with Edward
                        W. Clark for the Association for Diplomatic Studies Oral History Program. I
                        am Charles Stuart Kennedy. To begin I wonder if you would give me a little
                        about your background? When and where you grew up and were educated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, I was born in New York and grew up in New Jersey. I went to school
                    at the Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey and then went to Princeton. I
                    graduated from Princeton in 1939 and then went to Cornell Law School. In 1941 I
                    finished my first year there and realized that I was not going to be able to
                    finish so decided to do something else. I finally ended up in the job as a
                    diplomatic courier in the US State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: In June 1941</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I had applied to the Naval Air Corps training program and had just taken a
                    certain test in that regard. I was waiting to hear from them. I had a younger
                    brother at Princeton and drove down during Easter vacation to pick him up and
                    bring him back home to Ridgewood, New Jersey. I spent the night there and we
                    went out with two of my former professors in the history department. During the
                    evening everybody was discussing the same subject...what was going to happen in
                    the war that was about to come and what everybody was going to do. Well my
                    younger brother was in ROTC so he knew what he was going to do. He was going to
                    graduate and then go into the Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>One of the professors had applied to the Air Force for a commission and the other
                    one had decided that he was going to go into the Marine Corps. The second one of
                    these professors also headed up the student employment bureau at Princeton and
                    when it came to my turn I told them that I had already applied to the Naval Air
                    Corps training program.</p>
                <p>This chap said, “You know an interesting letter came across my desk today from
                    the State Department. They are looking for two couriers, two graduates, who they
                    want to hire as couriers because they are starting a courier service in Latin
                    America.” I said, “Tell me more about that,” which he did. It was of great
                    interest to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Some. I said, “How do you apply for this?” He said, “Well, I can send you
                    an application form up at Ithaca if you want it.” I said, “Fine. Do so.” So I
                    got it, filled it out and was then asked to come to Princeton for an interview
                    with the then head of personnel of the Department of State. Then, of course, I
                    didn't hear anything more.</p>
                <p>So when I graduated in June I had the Navy, which had just informed me that I was
                    accepted and the State Department, from which I hadn't heard. So I sent a wire
                    to the State Department and explained the situation and asked to be advised
                    because if I was not being considered I was going to go into the Naval program.
                    I got a telegram back signed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull asking me to
                    come to Washington right away for a further interview.</p>
                <p>I came to Washington and was interviewed by the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    an hour. Then I was sent back to the head of personnel who told me to go have a
                    physical exam. I had the exam and was hired on the spot. Two weeks later I was
                    off to Panama on a ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about both war time and being a courier in
                        those days. This is something that is not picked up in our record. You are
                        unique in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: The reason for the courier service was just that...the war. The need for
                    better communication between posts and Washington of a classified nature was the
                    reason it was started. When I got to Panama in July, 1941 we were not in the war
                    yet, not for another six months. But they were already getting ready. There were
                    Service people all over the place. As far as we were concerned we had German,
                    Italian and British couriers all doing the same thing. Sometimes we were on the
                    same planes. We got to know the British, but we didn't have much to do with the
                    Italians and the Germans, if anything.</p>
                <p>We had regular schedules and were on the road all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you armed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No. No arms. The myth about having your pouch chained to your wrist is a
                    myth. Sometimes we had large amounts in which case we would have to have another
                    seat. That didn't happen too often until later when we got into the war. Then
                    the Navy assigned Naval attach�s all over Latin America and they began to send
                    big stuff. Code machines, private mail...we used to get 400 pounds of private
                    mail which made a problem as we couldn't handle it personally.</p>
                <p>At some point along the way it was realized that this wasn't working and it
                    wasn't classified material so we arranged with the Navy that we would check the
                    unclassified portion as regular baggage and just handle the classified stuff in
                    the plane itself.</p>
                <p>There were no particular incidents of a serious nature. It became rather routine
                    after everybody got used to meeting us and taking us back to the Embassy. We
                    would have to check the pouches at night and get up at 4:00 in the morning and
                    somebody would have to come to the code room and give you your mail and then off
                    you would go to the airport and on. But there were no serious incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed on the Latin America circuit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, I was on the Latin America circuit from 1941 until beginning of
                    1944. Then I went to Madrid where we started a courier service to North Africa
                    and within Spain. I was there for six months. Then in September in 1945 when
                    Paris was liberated, I was assigned from Madrid to Paris to open up a courier
                    service there. I guess I was about the third person to arrive at the Embassy in
                    Paris after liberation. Working out of Paris I got to Brussels, Luxembourg...I
                    opened up a courier service to Switzerland. I was the first American into
                    Switzerland after four years of it being sealed off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had information gotten to us? Alan Dulles had been
                        working hard there. How did we work out of Switzerland without
                        couriers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: You would have to ask Alan Dulles that but I suppose there were people who
                    got in and out, but it would have been done illegally. I was there legally. The
                    border had just opened. I had my diplomatic passport and courier letters and
                    they let me through. I brought three people back with me who had been in the
                    Embassy in Paris before and who we wanted back in their old jobs as the Embassy
                    was just opening again.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Then in 1944 we had the Battle of the Bulge and the military kind of panicked.
                    They revoked our military status designations and brought us all back into the
                    various Services. This would include many young Foreign Service officers
                    throughout the world as well as the couriers. I actually entered the Navy in
                    March, 1945. A few days before I was about to be sent to China...I was an Ensign
                    in the Navy...I had gone to Harvard Business School...Just a few days before I
                    was to step on a plane to go to China the bomb was dropped and everything was
                    canceled.</p>
                <p>I ended up in Hawaii. With the war over the State Department got all of us back.
                    I had taken the Foreign Service exams while up at Harvard and I entered the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Madrid. You were there and it was very
                        much under Franco and it was war time conditions. What was life in Madrid
                        from your perspective like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Everybody felt the hard hand of Franco. That was, of course, very
                    depressing. On the other hand he didn't bother, really, very much with any of
                    the diplomats that were there. We were allowed to move about, were not harassed
                    except perhaps occasionally concerning our passports. The conditions, of course,
                    in Spain were very, very poor because of the civil war having just been finished
                    a short time before. For all of the diplomatic personnel it was not hard living.
                    We were not molested. If you had money you could get food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a neutral capital but there had been a certain
                        affinity between Hitler and Franco, was there any concern about spies
                        intercepting couriers, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Oh, yes. But that didn't really involve us. We were carriers of mail. But
                    there was certainly that atmosphere. Everybody was in there trying to get
                    intelligence and thwart other people's intelligence. The same thing was going on
                    in Lisbon. One of our main jobs as couriers there was to carry the kind of
                    messages that needed to be carried to take care of the problem of US Air Force
                    people who were shot down in Europe and made their way across the Pyrenees into
                    northern Spain. There were a lot of them. Our consuls up in Bilbao and in the
                    north were always being involved in that and having to notify our people in
                    Madrid. I am sure there was a lot of paper work to get them out. So an internal
                    courier service was very important at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Spanish authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: They were quite cooperative. Again they were in the middle. They may have
                    sympathized with the Axis powers...no doubt Franco did. But the war wasn't
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Franco obviously didn't want to get dragged into the war
                        despite Hitler's earlier attempts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CLARK: He certainly didn't want to get into the war after we invaded North Africa
                    and it looked like we had won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Panama in 1946 and served three years there.
                        What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: My first job there was as passport officer. We had three officers in the
                    consular section...an officer in charge, one for visas and one for passports. I
                    did that for about six months. Then I did a short stint in the visa section.
                    There was then a big turnover of some kind and within a year I ended up in
                    charge of the consular section which was a pretty big job for one of my
                    inexperience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Panama have a fairly large refugee population trying
                        to get to the United States? I am thinking of people who got stranded there
                        from Europe and other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No, that was not a big problem there. The main problem in the passport
                    section was taking care of passports because there was a large American
                    community in the Canal Zone who had to get renewals, or first-time passports,
                    register children who were born there, etc. That was the main thing in the
                    passport section. In the visa section it was mainly Panamanian, although there
                    were a few refugees of various kinds from the war who would drift in. But that
                    wasn't a major problem. There were a lot of protection cases there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Americans who lived in the Canal Zone like?
                        Could you characterize them at this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Like any place. You had the good and bad. There was such a clash of
                    cultures there between the Americans in the Canal Zone and the Panamanians. The
                    standard of living was so different; the values were so different. It was just
                    normal that there would be resentment. They had two different scales of
                    pay...the gold standard and the silver standard. Also racially there were
                    problems. Many Americans were from the South which made the problem of race more
                    difficult. Quite frankly there were many people in the Canal Zone that I came to
                    know very well and liked. But as a group they wanted their privileges and would
                    fight for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also it was not a period of time when one was trying to be
                        culturally aware and operate in a less high handed fashion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CLARK: There was no pressure to do that. After all, the official situation was
                    the gold standard and the silver standard. White people only in the gold
                    bathroom and others in the silver bathroom and facilities. They got paid on
                    different wage schedules. That was all official. I have seen some ugly scenes
                    there, very embarrassing. But I have seen some in Washington, too, when I came
                    in 1941. I will never forget that the first evening I was in Washington I got on
                    a bus and all of a sudden the bus driver said, “Get back in the bus you black
                    son of a bitch.” I saw this scene duplicated many times in the Canal Zone. Same
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy relate to the Panamanian government?
                        Was the relationship a little colonial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I wouldn't say so. On the contrary. You had the colonial attitude in the
                    Canal Zone. The Embassy was always trying to cope with that situation vis-a-vis
                    the Panamanian government. The government would make their complaints through
                    us. We would then have to see what we could do with the Canal Zone authorities
                    to smooth things over. So, I think on the contrary the Embassy's job was to try
                    to keep irritations to a minimum.</p>
                <p>At that time, of course, we had a major problem with the bases that we had
                    constructed all through the Republic of Panama during the war. We were
                    renegotiating that agreement and it went on for a long time. It came to a head
                    in 1948. The Panamanian national assembly rejected the agreement. We were asking
                    to retain a number of bases. Secretary of State Marshall had warned them that if
                    this did happen we would withdraw, which they didn't believe. But it was a very,
                    very heated debate and a very critical time in our relationship. Within 48 hours
                    we got everybody out of Panama...not the Canal Zone. We must have had 20 bases
                    in Panama.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: It certainly was, but nationalism was at its peak and they didn't think we
                    would carry out our threat. Unfortunately, the military had already reached the
                    conclusion we didn't need them but didn't say it. So our relations suffered a
                    severe setback for no good reason.</p>

                <p>CLARK: Right, we had already made the decision to phase out the bases. We were

                <p>CLARK: No, I don't think so. I certainly didn't feel any of this and I lived in
                    the center of town almost across the street from the National Palace. It wasn't
                    personal then, it became so later on when things got difficult over the Canal
                    Treaties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I was Desk Officer for El Salvador and Guatemala.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still during the Truman Administration. What were
                        our relations with El Salvador and Guatemala in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: They were very good with El Salvador. Everything was quiet there. The
                    military controlled the situation there with the oligarchy. They had already had
                    their hoedown with the peasants in 1932 when they shot 30,000 of them, or
                    something like that. There was no problems between us and El Salvador, but with
                    Guatemala we had major problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on in Guatemala in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, in Guatemala you just had an overthrow of a long time dictator named
                    Jorge Ubico who had kept the wraps on the situation there. Then you had an
                    election and a fellow by the name of Juan Jos Arevalo became president. He was a
                    very liberal minded fellow. Of course, anybody at that time began to be
                    considered, thought of, or maybe was a communist. But I don't think he was. But
                    he certainly introduced a lot of progressive reforms there benefitting the
                    people, but often hurting the United Fruit Company, which was the big American
                    interest there.</p>
                <p>After him another election was held and the major perspective winner was going to
                    be a Colonel Arana. He probably would have been a good president. He also was a
                    center of the road fellow who was highly regarded in Guatemala. However, it was
                    arranged that he be assassinated, and he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say it was arranged that he be
                        assassinated...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CLARK: Well, who knows exactly who did it. But I think it was a group in the
                    military itself who wanted Colonel Arbenz to be president. He was a much more
                    leftist thinking individual than Arana was and probably even than Arevalo was.
                    The election took place and he was elected. What he did was allow the Arevalo
                    program to go farther and farther. He was very much in favor of the
                    liberalization of the labor laws, which again hurt the United Fruit Company
                    right away. He encouraged the importation of arms from Czechoslovakia. We didn't
                    like that. In general he took a very, very liberal path and soon he was being
                    called a communist in the eyes of the Americans, the United Fruit Company in
                    particular.</p>
                <p>I cannot say that he wasn't a communist. When it was all over he took refuge in
                    Cuba. But there is a body of thinking that he wasn't actually a communist. I am
                    inclined to think that myself. In any event he was a communist for the United
                    Fruit Company and they were not only lobbying in the State Department but were
                    up on the Hill. They wanted him out because he was affecting their interests
                    very severely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel as the desk officer? The desk officer at
                        this period of time didn't have the layering that you have now so that the
                        desk officer had much more influence than later on when you had directors,
                        deputy assistant secretaries, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: You worked directly with the Assistant Secretary in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the influence of the United Fruit Company work? We
                        are talking about the '49-'53 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well there wasn't any question about the fact that they were hurting the
                    United Fruit Company and there wasn't any question that some of the things that
                    were being done down there were, even if not communist inspired, off the wall
                    and the United Fruit Company was going to be driven out of there one way or
                    another. So, certainly you had to be sympathetic to their problem. They were
                    getting screwed.</p>
                <p>So what to do? You make your representations telling them that it was going to
                    affect our relations very severely, and it did. Things were very ticklish and
                    confrontational between the United States and Guatemala in those days. The
                    Guatemalan Ambassador at that time was an archeologist, a very sensitive
                    individual who had been educated at the University of Chicago and married to an
                    American woman. He had to support all of these hard-nosed allegations against
                    the United States and it drove him to suicide. He shot himself. So things were
                    really very tense, very bad. They were still bad when I left.</p>

                        Eisenhower Administration. Did we have any levers to pull in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No, there was no AID program in Guatemala in those days. They had us, the
                    United Fruit, as hostage. The only leverage...there wasn't any real leverage
                    other than the threat of possible intervention which always hung over the

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No, this was the first time there had been anything like a possible or
                    real communist government in our hemisphere. And that was pretty upsetting at
                    that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: And it was very real regardless whether Arbenz was a communist or not, and
                    it was very shocking to us at that time. After all you had Senator McCarthy and
                    all we “communists” in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to talk about that. Who was the Assistant Secretary
                        for Latin America Affairs during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Eddie Miller.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude? This was of obvious major concern

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: They were, of course, concerned. You have to go back to that time when
                    McCarthyism and communism was at its height and here we had communism right in
                    our back yard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about McCarthyism both at large, as far as you
                        felt it, but also on this particular job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: McCarthy never entered the Guatemalan situation to my knowledge. He
                    directed his attack against people and the institution of the State Department.
                    But this was a prime example for anybody who believed in McCarthyism. Here is
                    this commie government and what are you doing about it? Well, what could you do?
                    What we could do was what we did finally.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It wasn't a very comfortable job to be in at the time, believe me. You know one
                    day a gentleman came into my office. He was an accountant and had just come back
                    from Guatemala. He said, “I have something I am very worried about and not sure
                    what to do about it, but I thought maybe this was the right place to start.” I
                    said, “What is the problem?” He said, “Well, I have been an accountant for the
                    railroad in Guatemala.” The railroad was built by American investment and 51%
                    owned by the United Fruit Company and 49% by other investors. He said, “I have
                    worked now five or six years there and the United Fruit Company has been taking
                    advantage of the Guatemalans and taking advantage of their 51%
                    ownership...giving themselves deductions on the railroad. This, of course, is
                    hurting the other investors.” I said, “Don't tell me this. It is the last thing
                    that I need.” He said, “Well, it is true and I have to do something about it. I
                    think I will go to the investors and explain exactly what has been happening.” I
                    said, “Do you really want to do this now?” He said, “Yes, in all conscience I
                    do.”</p>
                <p>Well, he did. They filed a court case up in Jersey City. They got a judgment
                    against the United Fruit Company which was published in all of the Guatemalan
                    papers. It was just what the Guatemalans had said the United Fruit Company was
                    doing in Guatemala. The company had to pay retribution to the other investors.
                    All this right out in the open. So where were you trying to defend the Fruit
                    Company when they were robbing our own investors. This was a further
                    complication to the problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: What we finally did was to intervene. I had left by that time and was

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CLARK: Eritrea had just been federated with the Empire of Ethiopia by the United
                    Nations. The British had just left. It was then turned over to a local Eritrean
                    government but federated with the Ethiopian Empire. The Ethiopians had customs,
                    immigration, defense and foreign affairs. The other things like garbage
                    collection and local police and fire departments were part of the Eritrean
                    government responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Eritreans feel about this situation at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: One of my jobs was to keep track of how this federation was proceeding,
                    whether it was being respected by the Ethiopians. The Eritreans and the
                    Ethiopians had always been at odds. The Ethiopians over the centuries would
                    every once in a while come down and beat up on the Eritreans and take back a
                    bunch of their wives and make them pay them tribute and then they would go back.
                    This went on for centuries. They didn't like each other. And the Eritreans had
                    obviously good reasons for not liking the Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>The Italians, of course, had been in Eritrea for some 40-50 years. They had a
                    great influence on the Eritreans. They built a lot of roads, good schools. The
                    Eritreans in many ways were better off and better educated than the
                    Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>It was obvious to everybody, I think, including the United Nations that this was
                    not going to last. This was just the papering over of a problem in order to let
                    the United Nations get out of there.</p>
                <p>So the three years I was there you could see the gradual diminishing of this
                    structure. The Ethiopians were gradual about it but obviously they were going
                    to... Well we reported that but there wasn't much we could do. Our big interest
                    there was the American military.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kagnew Station. Had Kagnew been established by that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Kagnew Station was originally an Italian naval communications center. When
                    the British took over from the Italians in 1942, they gave us that naval
                    station, and we used it as a naval station at first. Then it expanded pretty
                    quickly and was used as a station that could monitor nuclear explosions in the
                    Soviet Union plus, because of its location, it was a good relay station for the
                    military system across the world.</p>
                <p>So by the time I got there, about 11 years later, it was a substantial station
                    run by the Army with a smaller naval communications unit.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>It was our major interest and our major problem because there were some 2,000
                    people there and they were getting into trouble. We had the usual PXs there and
                    people would buy there and sell outside and the merchants would complain,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>They had the need for expansion and during the time I was there, there was
                    negotiated a new agreement which provided for a new facility to house all the
                    stations plus some receiving and sending antenna fields. Interestingly that was
                    all negotiated in Asmara instead of Ethiopia, so that we, the American consul
                    and the Commander of the post there were very, very much involved in the
                    negotiations. It was very interesting. I know of no other time when an agreement
                    like that was negotiated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With whom were you negotiating with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: We were negotiating with the local Ethiopian Federal Government. The
                    Emperor's representative there in Asmara. The details were all worked out over a
                    period of a year. When that was finally agreed to then we all went up to Addis
                    and with the Ethiopian Government and the Embassy finally signed the
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador in Addis Ababa was Joseph Simonson who was
                        not a career officer. How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: He was a minister of the church in Minneapolis and a Republican supporter.
                    I think he had said the prayers at several Republican conventions. He really
                    didn't know what he was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was probably one reason why the negotiations were
                        held at Asmara.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No, I think it was because the details couldn't have been negotiated
                    without being in Asmara and actually going out to the sites, etc.</p>
                <p>He was not involved in it. He was unfortunate. Remember Nixon made a trip around
                    Africa as Vice President?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I interviewed somebody not long ago who accompanied

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: When Nixon came back from that he said that there was one meatball
                    ambassador that has to go, and that was Simonson as it turned out. A terrible
                    thing to say but...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No, he was unfortunate. He was a nice guy but shouldn't have been in that
                    position. There are lots of other ambassadors I know, political and otherwise,
                    who shouldn't have been there either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this affect your work at all or was he over the hill
                        and far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: We were able to report directly to Washington. I would send copies to the
                    Embassy but they didn't have to go to the Embassy. So we were fairly
                    independent. We handled all their mail for them because it came in through the
                    APO. The military would turn it over to us and we would put the Embassy mail on
                    the local Ethiopian airline planes. They were always calling us asking for their
                    mail. At one point they accused us of holding it up, if you can imagine that,
                    for Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression you were getting from those in
                        Eritrea of Haile Selassie in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: The Eritrean people didn't like the Ethiopians so they didn't like the
                    Emperor. He came there several times while I was there. They had a big reception
                    up at the Emperor's representative's palace. But he didn't spend much time down
                    there. But no, Eritrean people didn't like the Ethiopians, period. And they
                    still don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now they are at least quasi independent, but I am not
                        sure...Were there any other nationalities there that had any influence in
                        that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: The Italians did. The Ethiopian policy towards the Italians was very well
                    thought out. They advised their people to treat them properly. They wanted them
                    to stay because they were the ones who could build the roads, fix the
                    electricity, do all the things that the Ethiopians didn't know how to do to keep
                    things going. So there was a substantial populous of Italians of that level
                    there. Plus some fairly well-to-do Italians. They had the beer plant there, a
                    textile plant, they had a large dairy producing farm and a number of other
                    things. So the Italians were very much in the ballpark there, very influential.
                    I would say that the Italian Consul General was much more influential than any
                    of us were at the time. Apart from that, no...</p>

                <p>CLARK: No, no Soviets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, the Israelis had a kosher meat packing plant there. Eritrea became a
                    central place for produce for ARAMCO. They had an agent there who bought and
                    they would send a plane over once or twice a week to take fresh produce
                    back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: They used to come over and take their R&amp;R there too. Did you ever do
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never got over. Well then you left Eritrea and came
                        back and had about a year's stint in Personnel in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes, in Performance and Evaluation. We saw to it that all the efficiency
                    reports were written and filed on time and in the files for the Promotion Board
                    Meetings. We reviewed the records of officers who wanted to know what was in
                    their record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the system was working at
                        that time—basically the promotion system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I thought it was as good as anything you could probably devise. One of the
                    things that changed just about this time was the opening up of the files and
                    requiring the writer to show or discuss it with the officer being rated. That
                    was new just about the time I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that you couldn't see your record until you got
                        back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Even then you were restricted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of things that might be in there that

                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CLARK: That is quite true and is the reason that they went to this new policy. Of
                    course, it developed that lots of reports didn't reflect some of the adverse
                    characteristics of the officer being rated. The rater didn't want to have
                    conflicts with someone who was working for him. So then you began to get...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes, I was assigned to the Office of Congressional Relations.</p>

                        Who was in charge of that and how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Bill Macomber was the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been an aide to a Congressman or Senator, hadn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes. He had been aide to Senator Sherman Cooper. When Dulles came in as
                    Secretary of State, he was brought in as Special Assistant and later became
                    Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working for Bill Macomber? He had a
                        temper that was renown throughout the Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, he was a very difficult fellow to work for. He was a workaholic, a
                    bachelor and temperamental as could be. He was fundamentally a nice person, but
                    his personality made it very difficult.</p>
                <p>I managed all right because the first time he lost his temper with me I called
                    him on it. I said, “Don't ever talk to me like that again.” He respected that
                    and he seldom lost his temper with me from then on. He was demanding, tough.
                    There are so many stories about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, tell one or two just to give a little flavor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I will tell you one about Dick Rubottom and Macomber.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: He was up on the Hill testifying and something happened there which
                    angered him immensely. He came back to the Department and went right into
                    Macomber and said, “You, get in the elevator we are going right up to see the
                    Secretary and have it out!” And they had it out with the Secretary. Bill Snow
                    did the same thing. He came into Macomber's office and said, “Listen, you so and
                    so, if you ever do that again.......”</p>
                <p>In a way Macomber was a bully. But yet he had a nice side to him that I got to
                    know and like. If he wasn't under all this pressure he could be a very decent
                    person with a good sense of humor and all that.</p>

                <p>CLARK: He got married while I was in Argentina to Phyllis, Mr. Dulles' secretary,
                    and I heard about it and wrote him a letter congratulating him. I got a seven
                    page letter back written while on his honeymoon in Geneva. To this day I think

                        because there is no constituency but also Foreign Service people as a whole
                        tend to not be sensitive to the needs of Congress on foreign relations
                        things. They feel Congress is meddling and show it. Did you find it was an

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: No. I think everybody tried hard, really. There was a certain attitude
                    that it was none of their damn business and I have a lot of things on my mind
                    and have to answer this idiot. But by and large in my experience they tried
                    their best to give the Congressman or Senator the information he wanted.
                    Macomber would be the first to say they don't respond. I think you can carry it
                    too far the other way...drop everything and take care of the Congress. But my
                    experience is no, when something came in they went to work on it and tried their

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in 1960-63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: It was bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cuba had boiled over by that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yeah, we were a staging ground for part of that 1962 business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you say bad, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CLARK: Their demands for negotiation of a new treaty was their top priority. We
                    took the position that that wasn't advisable, nor necessary nor did we want to.
                    Riots took place and there was an atmosphere of real animosity over this issue.
                    The Embassy took the position that we should negotiate and the Department was
                    adamantly set against it. Of course that means that you are a heel not just to
                    the Department but to the guys across the way in the military command over there
                    too—Canal Command and the Southern Command.</p>
                <p>Although I must say that there were some who were understanding but wouldn't put
                    their neck out. It was really putting your neck out at that time to go on record
                    saying that was the route we had to take or suffer the real consequences of a
                    big confrontation.</p>
                <p>That's why my second tour of duty there was not a very happy one as the first one
                    had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Alliance for Progress, when the Kennedy
                        Administration came in, help ease things? A show of more concern for Latin
                        America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I will just speak for Panama. It really had nothing to do with it. The
                    Canal was it, forget about the rest of it. They would use the Canal problem to
                    fleece us out of more money and aid. That was the way to get at us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that the Panamanians wanted to take over the Canal
                        completely and run it or to reach some sort of compromise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, they wanted their sovereignty recognized which then would eventually
                    lead to the end of the treaty at some particular point. That was the issue. The
                    treaty said we had this strip, five miles wide as though we were sovereign, in
                    perpetuity. They wanted the perpetuity clause out and they wanted their
                    sovereignty. Of course, if they have sovereignty they have control of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though the Embassy was making representations to
                        Washington, I take it there was no move towards negotiations in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, they realized there was a big problem there and had been one for a
                    long time. They sent a fellow down, a special assistant to Kennedy by the name
                    of Kaison, a very smart cookie, to case the joint. This was before the upcoming
                    visit of Panamanian President Chiari to Washington. Carl Kaison came down and I
                    was selected to take care of him. I went around with him and made his
                    appointments and got to know him. I never saw his report but there was no
                    question about the fact that he came away with the conclusion that it had to be
                    done. If not today, pretty soon tomorrow.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>What Kennedy was afraid of, why Carl Kaison was sent down there, was that during
                    this meeting that was what the President was going to ask for, the negotiation
                    of a new treaty, and what was Kennedy going to say to avoid a real problem. So
                    what happened was that when Chiari came up here it wasn't agreed to negotiate a
                    new treaty but there were certain things set up...I forget the details...that
                    would put it off for a while. It at least met a few of their demands.</p>
                <p>That occurred in 1962 and I left at the end of the year. So we had gotten over
                    that hurdle. But in January of 1964 the big explosion took place, the one that
                    would have taken place during that meeting if some concessions had not been made
                    and put it off for a while. That was the big uprising where we had to call up
                    our soldiers and people got shot and all that jazz. But that is another story
                    that involves me too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that? Was that later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: That was in January, 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that involve you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I was called back and made Director for Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were supposed to go to Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I did go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Only a year and four months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Panama, Joseph Farland was the

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, Joe Farland was a nice fellow who we got to know very well. We had
                    children the same age as his children. He was a public relations fellow
                    essentially. He was very good at it...making friends, going places, dancing the
                    tamborito, and all that. To a large extent he left the real running of the
                    Embassy pretty much to the DCM.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, of course, they had their requirements for military aid to the
                    continent. There wasn't any of that with Panama, so speaking from the point of
                    view while I was in Panama I was aware of these other requirements that they
                    had, but it was outside of our relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Argentina at the end of 1962 for about a

                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes, I went there in February 1963 and left in July of 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I was political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Ambassador was Robert McClintock, who is again one of
                        the characters of the Foreign Service. Would you talk about him a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: He was a wonderful fellow if he liked your style. If he didn't like your
                    style you were out. He was smart as a whip. There were only two people that I
                    have ever known who could sit down and dictate a ten page telegram or memo
                    without pausing. He was one and the other was George Kennan. I happened to have
                    had the very good fortune of being assigned to go around Latin America with
                    Kennan in 1950. Just he and I. We spent three weeks together. Those two were
                    brilliant people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennan was Policy Planning at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Just leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Kennan's reaction toward Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CLARK: He wrote, I think, maybe the best report on Latin America that has ever
                    been written. It is unclassified now. What he said in that report was that this
                    was a vibrant place with all kinds of problems, but the difference in outlook,
                    the difference in values, the difference in their attitudes towards life are so
                    different from ours that we have great difficulty understanding them. And people
                    who serve in Latin America really have to build up a defensive mechanism of
                    cynicism in order to survive, in order to do their job without getting buried.
                    That was, I think, the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With McClintock, first of all, what were the issues in
                        Argentina that concerned us during this 1963-64 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: The usual one of military dictatorship versus democracy, elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the dictator there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: General Aramburu, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was post Peron?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Oh, yes. We had an election there. Interestingly enough, the party that
                    got elected was really a minor party but the Peronists didn't vote because they
                    were protesting. So this minor party got elected and we in the political section
                    happened to be the only ones that knew these guys. We and the consul in Cordoba,
                    Bill Lehfeldt, were the only ones who had any contact with these people because
                    they weren't expected to do anything. This put us in the political section in
                    great shape because we knew everybody, including the president. Rob McClintock
                    didn't get excited about that he just said, “Look, go on they are yours. You
                    find out about them and I will meet them later.” So we had a heyday in that
                    period of time before and quite a while after he was inaugurated.</p>
                <p>That was one of the problems and the elections, of course, made us happy for a
                    while.</p>
                <p>Then another problem was military assistance. We had never had an agreement with
                    them about it and they wanted some help so we had to have an agreement. Well, I
                    got very much involved in that. We had some harrowing times negotiating that;
                    contending with their extreme nationalistic attitudes. But eventually we got it
                    signed, for good or bad. I never was sure whether it was a good or bad
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Apart from that I don't recall that there was anything very dramatic. Oh, yes
                    there was. They expropriated the oil companies and Averell Harriman was sent
                    down to take care of the situation because he used to play polo with some of the
                    people in the Argentine. We had several meetings there with ministers. I
                    remember one we had in the Embassy. Rob McClintock hosted a dinner and then we
                    all sat around a big table. The Minister of Labor was there for some reason. He
                    was a very talkative individual and made no sense. McClintock was translating
                    back and forth. Finally Harriman said to McClintock, “Tell that man down there
                    to shut up. I don't want to hear any more of his dribble.” McClintock turns to
                    him and translates, “The Ambassador says he appreciates very much the
                    information you have given him, thank you very much.”</p>
                <p>This was just before they took over the oil companies. Harriman was sent down
                    there to see that they didn't. He was en route home when they actually took it
                    over and all hell broke loose.</p>
                <p>To come back to McClintock's mind. The very next day he called in all the oil
                    people and we met in his office. We had a discussion about what this all meant
                    to them, to various relationships, etc. A two hour discussion. Then he pushed
                    his bell and his secretary came in and sat down with her pad. He said, “I think
                    we ought to get something off here.” They were all sitting there. He dictated
                    seven pages. He says to the assembled group, “Is there anything in there that
                    somebody would like to add to or change?” Quiet. Finally somebody said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador I don't think we could have said it better ourselves.” And off it
                    went. It was a magnificent performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you alluded to it, but how come you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, this riot took place in Panama in January, 1964. That brought things
                    to a real head. Tom Mann had just been moved over from the White House to be
                    Assistant Secretary for Latin America, and he looks around for somebody to take
                    over that job. Somebody suggested my name or he thought of me, but I got a
                    telegram telling me to come immediately to Washington. I met with Tom. I didn't
                    want to go back there, it was an awful job. It was something like that Guatemala
                    job but much worse. During the conversation with Tom I told him I did not want
                    the job. I knew all about it and it was the last job I wanted that I could think
                    of. He said, “Well, I don't want this job either.” So I said, “All right, if I
                    have to do it, I have to do it, of course. But there is one thing you must know
                    beforehand.” He said, “What's that?” I said, “There is no other answer but to
                    negotiate a new treaty and I can't operate in this job unless you feel the same
                    way.” He thought about it for a moment and then said, “Okay. How soon can you be
                    back here?” So at least I got that much and that made it possible for me to
                    work.</p>

                <p>CLARK: Four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Johnson Administration. What was the
                        attitude of the Johnson Administration towards negotiating a treaty and how
                        did you operate in this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Mr. Johnson didn't want trouble. I think just fundamentally everybody knew
                    this had to be done and furthermore the Panama Canal was a wasting asset, not
                    the strategic asset that it was when it was built. It was important but not
                    vital. Furthermore the importance was that it be open and operated properly and
                    not that we necessarily do it. The question always was, well, could it be?</p>
                <p>This was Johnson's biggest first international problem. He was inaugurated
                    November, 1963 and January 9, 1964 here is this big uprising. His first problem
                    in international affairs. His attitude was to do something.</p>
                <p>I got there in July, 1964 and in December, if I remember correctly, we had
                    arrived at the point where Mr. Johnson made a speech in which he said that we
                    would begin negotiations of a new treaty. That took an awful lot of work and
                    quite frankly when I got there in July I didn't believe this was going to happen
                    at all, much less that it would happen in that time frame.</p>
                <p>Then we began negotiations. Mr. Johnson became the real desk officer. I was
                    working for him as assistant deputy. I remember going to a meeting one time of
                    office directors and Carol Laise was heading up this meeting. The meeting was
                    called for the purpose of exchanging views of how to get your problems over to
                    the White House and some decisions made. I listened to this and said, “I think
                    you could probably excuse me from this meeting. Mr. Johnson is the desk officer
                    on Panama and I don't have any problems getting things over to the White House.”
                    So I left the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? What would he do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, he would call up Tom Mann and say, “What are we doing about so and
                    so?” Tom would call me and say, “What are we doing about so and so?” Or Bill
                    Bowdler or Bob Sayre, who were assistants over there in the White House would
                    call. “The President wants to do something dramatic, what can we do?” He
                    literally was on top of that situation all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the four years, what were we doing? What progress was
                        made?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CLARK: Well, we negotiated a new treaty. We had a negotiating team headed by
                    Robert Anderson and Jack Erwin and Bob Woodward. I backstopped that, I wasn't on
                    it. I thought it was better to keep operational things here and negotiations
                    over there. We negotiated a new treaty. It was signed in principle by the two
                    negotiating teams for referral to their separate governments for signature.</p>
                <p>This leaked right away and the text got into the Chicago papers. All hell broke
                    loose because it was like McCarthy and communism, if you negotiate the Panama
                    Canal away you are a communist. We started to testify in the Congress. We were
                    called there by the Armed Service Committee. Meanwhile the same thing was
                    happening in Panama. Whether we would have gotten that treaty through our
                    Congress, I don't know. But down there they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That shoe dropped first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: They got there first. So we were informed by the President of Panama that
                    he couldn't sign it, political conditions prevented him from doing so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sort of took you off the hook right away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: It took us right off the hook, which was really a remarkable achievement.
                    As you know there was a hiatus, this was in 1968, and then they began to talk
                    about things again in the early 1970s. Nixon began to talk about taking it up
                    again and eventually another treaty was negotiated, signed and ratified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were those treaties in retrospect pretty similar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes. The same principle...recognize their sovereignty and then reserve
                    certain powers for the operation of the Canal and the protection of the
                    Canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after this in 1968, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: In 1968 I had a ruptured disc and had an operation. They didn't know
                    exactly what to do with me for a while because there was a certain period of
                    recuperation. They assigned me to the Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. I was there for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CLARK: Then I went to Peru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Peru for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: From 1969-73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went as DCM. Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Taylor Belcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a career officer. What was the situation in Peru in
                        this particular period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One could use the same word today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, not as bad as it is today. A military government had taken over in
                    1968, just about a year before I got there. They had a program of radical reform
                    that was very nationalistic. They wanted to have national companies rather than
                    foreign companies. They put the pressure on all the foreign interests
                    there—Grace and Company, Marcona Mines, the tuna industry and a variety of other
                    manufacturers. This was very anti-foreign, particularly American. It was not
                    personally so. Individually, including in the armed forces, who were running the
                    whole thing, they were not antagonistic. In fact personally it was a very
                    pleasant four years. Nonetheless, from an official point of view it was
                    rough.</p>
                <p>Again, what influences did we have to counter this nationalistic reform that
                    benefited the people? Not much. We had an AID program and we kept it pretty much
                    the way it was. We always hoped to be able to work something out that would be
                    better. What happened is eventually it did work out that way. There was a global
                    negotiated arrangement where the Peruvians took over and paid for all of the
                    foreign assets there. Now the latter didn't get maybe what they wanted, but they
                    got 75 cents on the dollar and they all left reasonably satisfied.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for Peru they don't know how to run those companies and things
                    haven't been good for them. It took five years of that. This happened after I
                    left, but the effort was being made all along to get them to discuss how they
                    could take over the foreign companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Ambassador Belcher in dealing with this
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CLARK: Excellent. He was an extrovert who got along with everybody, but
                    particularly the military. He was always an outgoing fellow. They liked him. He
                    was good with the jokes and very sound. A wonderful person to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1973 and what did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enough was enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Well, yes. I had three children in college and we hadn't had them with us
                    for the last four years so I thought we should stay here. I could have had a job
                    here but I didn't want the Department again and didn't want to go overseas, so I
                    retired and did what I always liked to do anyway. That is to play golf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. I appreciate
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: It has been kind of fun. I was wondering this morning if I would be able
                    to remember anything?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think all of us can when we start walking our way
                        through it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLARK: Yes, you remember a lot. A lot went through my mind when we were talking
                    that I could have thrown in too but you can't go on and on.</p>
