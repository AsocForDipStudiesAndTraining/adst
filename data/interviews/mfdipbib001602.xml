                <p>Interviewed by: Monique Wong</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 2, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Monique Wong on December 2nd, 1992. I'm
                        interviewing Maryann Minutillo, Director of Family Liaison Office for the
                        Foreign Service Spouse Oral History, Inc. We're at Mrs. Minutillo's office
                        at the State Department at C Street, Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Maryann, I thought I [would] start right away with your involvement with FLO.
                    Perhaps you can tell me how you first got involved in it?</p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I've been the director of the Family Liaison Office since 1988. I
                    suppose my involvement with FLO was considerably earlier as a Foreign Service
                    spouse, as a Foreign Service family member. My interest in the issues that FLO
                    has worked on probably started at the time the office was really begun because
                    I've always been a member of AAFSW, and I returned to Washington about the time
                    that AAFSW was working on the concerns of Foreign Service families, which led to
                    the establishment of the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be between '76 to '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's right. In 1976 I returned to Washington.</p>
                <p>I met some members of the Association. I believe I was already a member of the
                    Association, and I went to some meetings on the forum group. I was really very
                    excited about the changes that were occurring in American society at that time,
                    and some of the studies that were being done by AAFSW. So my association with
                    the issues of that this office is involved in extends really from the very
                    beginning of my involvement with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>My direct association with FLO I suppose began officially, or professionally,
                    when I became a CLO overseas in my last overseas post which was Paraguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been in 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I was in Paraguay from 1982 to 1985, and I was the CLO for two years.
                    I became, in effect, an overseas representative of this office, met the staff
                    members here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were here at the time? Do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Oh, yes, certainly. The director of the office was then Marcia Curran,
                    and I met here and I think everyone in the office when I came here for a
                    debriefing, which is something that we still do, either incumbent CLOs or CLOs
                    who are transiting Washington we ask to come in to meet the staff, and to give
                    staff members an update on what's going on at their post. I came to Washington,
                    I guess, summer vacation. I came into the FLO office and I met Marcia Curran, I
                    met Phyllis Habib who was the support services officer at that time. I met Sue
                    Parsons who later became the director, she was the deputy director then. I met
                    the employment counselor, the educational counselor, and I was really very
                    enthusiastic about that relationship between the field representatives, which I
                    have come, and the home office.</p>
                <p>Then I attended a community skills workshop at the overseas briefing center, and
                    we were encouraged to take the OBC community skills workshop because it helped
                    develop an awareness of the dynamics in the community, which of course was very
                    useful for a CLO. So that was my first direct contact with the staff members in
                    FLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many various areas were there at that time? That would
                        be the beginning of the 1980's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Probably when I came here and met people in 1983 or 1984. There was
                    the director, deputy director. I don't remember if there was a CLO support
                    office. I think probably not. At that time the deputy director kept up with the
                    CLOs in the field. They didn't have as many as they do now. We had an
                    educational counselor, employment — probably only one employment person, and
                    maybe a support person as well. I know we didn't have a skills bank person
                    because the skills bank was really in pretty early stages. It was not as
                    consumerized as it is now. So the staff, although I think in the content areas
                    was pretty much the same. It wasn't as fleshed out as it is now because we
                    didn't have the volume of work at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went back overseas to finish your tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Yes, I went back to Paraguay. I continued my work as CLO, and I went
                    into a second year of CLO. One of the outstanding things during my time there in
                    relation to this office was the opportunity to attend a CLO Regional Training
                    Conference which was held in South America. And I really remember that very
                    well. I remember meeting with people who had jobs like mine from Ecuador, and
                    other places, Brazil, Chile. It was such a vitalizing, and energizing kind of
                    conference that it has stayed with me in my role here, and in my commitment.
                    That was one of the things I was really very committed to when I joined the
                    staff here. We have continued support of the CLO program through very regular
                    training. For me it was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also went to Islamabad for the CLO conference
                        recently. Perhaps you can compare the two CLO conferences for me? The first
                        one you attended, and ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: ... and the one that I led, okay. That's really an interesting
                    question. I've looked back a lot during the time I've been director, and have
                    been working on CLO training here. What was most valuable for me as a CLO during
                    that training that I attended. I've really tried to sort of dissect that and
                    keep a sharp edge to what are we going to plan for the CLO? Because I think one
                    of the things that happens here in Washington is that we get a Washington
                    perspective. And if we don't really work hard at it, we lose the field
                    perspective. And the Foreign Service is about being ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: ... out there. It's about serving overseas, and it's the impact, I
                    think, of living and working in this wide variety of places all over the world.
                    That's what we in Washington have to be constantly aware. So I kept going back,
                    and I still do that in preparation for these conferences. What makes it really
                    worthwhile? I have to say that for me as a CLO meeting my colleagues, ensuring
                    with them what was unique about ... I still feel unique about the job, but I
                    found what was so unique, the things that I was feeling. About the strains of
                    caring and concern you have as a CLO. Sometimes you get to feel, “I'm really the
                    only one. I'm here doing this alone.” Meeting your colleagues you realize that's
                    not true. There are other people doing the same kinds of things, then added to
                    that the linkage with the some office, with FLO Washington, and with the other
                    resources that exist. That was very real to me, almost a gut reaction. I
                    thought, “Oh this is great. I'm meeting all these wonderful people who are
                    around me in South America, and I'm meeting this entire staff of people in
                    Washington whom I can call on.” I think that those two things, the linkage, the
                    sort of horizontal linkage with CLO's and your colleagues in the field, and the
                    linkages with the head office, the home office, are really vital. And in my work
                    here I've tried to preserve those two aspects.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has the relationships between the home office and the CLOs
                        out there changed in many ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, I think what we've done is we've built on, from the very
                    beginning in this office, a foundation of support from the home office to the
                    field offices. We're always changing, always improving, we're building, and
                    we've done that, I think, because things have become so much more complex, very
                    ... changes, demographic changes. There's so much more that is expected of a CLO
                    in the field, partly because there's just a lot more accountability in
                    everything that's done overseas.</p>
                <p>In the early days of the CLO program with maybe just a few CLOs in 12, 15, 20
                    places, or even 50 places — for many places this was the first time there was a
                    CLO — not have anything to compare it to. It was the most sought after job
                    because it was a positive job, and obviously very interesting. One of the things
                    that has changed, I think, in the last five to seven years is an increase in the
                    opportunities for work whether it's on the local economy through bilateral work
                    agreements that have increased, or because of the increased recognition of
                    spouse employment within the embassy. We have more opportunity, so the CLOs
                    position is not the only job available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if you're one [(CLO) you attend] the country team
                        meetings, however.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's right. I still think it happens to be the best job in the
                    embassy. I'm kind of biased on that. I really do. But what has changed I think
                    is the expectation of the CLO to produce. Expectation on the part of management,
                    the administrative officers, ambassadors, and DCMs, that had CLOs in other
                    places and they want the person that's on the staff now to do everything that
                    the previous one did, and maybe some more. There's more accountability through
                    the office of Inspector Generals across the board. And there's been a specific
                    addition in the CLO area in regard to crises, security, and evacuations. So what
                    I have seen as an evolution of the CLO position, which means that our work here
                    has also evolved. Our need to provide guidance, support, training,
                    materials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the major issues? You might have already
                        covered some of those at the Islamabad conference. That was in October?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: In Islamabad what we did was we met with the CLOs from the South Asian
                    regions, about ten CLOs. The major issues there, or the goals of the conference
                    — it was only two days, so it was really very reduced, it wasn't a full meeting
                    or conference — were to establish the linkages that I mentioned, and to help
                    train the CLOs to focus on how to assess their community needs, and to establish
                    the kind of program that would meet those needs. So, to that end we were looking
                    at the area of CLO responsibility. And if you have a limited number of hours, if
                    you're a CLO for 20 hours a week, you can't do everything for everyone. How do
                    you set those kinds of limits? How do you prioritize so that you're really doing
                    the best job that you can in a professional way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the amount of time that you have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: And the resources that you have, and the physical facilities, etc.
                    We've used the term the CLO as the catalyst in the community as a kind of
                    guiding, underlying principle; and the CLO as a professional. A kind of two-way
                    thing. We even have cute little diagrams that we used the CLO as the bridge. Who
                    do you work for is one of the questions we ask, if you're the CLO. And that's
                    not an easy thing to answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who do the people think they're working for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, you're working for the community network, but you're also
                    working for, and with the administrative team, with the country team. And
                    sometimes there's a conflict, isn't there? There's going to be some times when a
                    regulation, or policy, or just a community issue that the community may be
                    divided on. It could be something quite serious like the possibility of an
                    evacuation, or a difference of opinion as to whether these people want to leave,
                    or don't want to leave. But what's your role as the CLO? So we explore that and
                    try to help the CLO recognize her role as a professional member of the team
                    working on behalf of the community. But it plays out in some very interesting
                    ways because to be effective, and to be a professional member of the federal
                    government as we are, you have some responsibility and accountability. How do
                    you bring to management some of the things they may not want to hear?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for historical notes, whose idea was it to start CLO,
                        the Community Liaison Officers overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think that it was part of the original recommendation. I do remember
                    seeing the reports that came out of AAFSW which recommended the establishment of
                    this office, but I know that at the same time that this office was begun there
                    were 15 posts overseas that were established as part of a pilot project for a
                    Community Liaison Office program. The term FLO and CLO, FLO is always the term
                    used for this office, but I think at that time some of the offices in the field
                    were also called FLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about going back to elaborate on what you said earlier
                        about the Washington perspective? Can you enlighten me on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, you know its very amusing to sit here in Washington, in any job,
                    not just in FLO, in any one of the bureaus, in any of the other foreign affairs
                    agencies, and dictate what's to be done in the field offices, what should be
                    done in a particular post, have expectations for reports, they minimize the
                    importance of things because how important is it. People only get new lawn
                    furniture once every [few] years. But living in an environment which is so
                    different from living in the United States means that every single thing that we
                    do, whether it's sending your child to school, or taking them to school, whether
                    it's trying to get books because there isn't a lending library. All of those
                    things have an impact, I think, on your daily life. And in Washington it's easy
                    to forget that. In almost anything that you can mention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We take a lot of things for granted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: We take so much for granted. And even very minor things. Your child
                    may like to ride a bicycle, and you bring a bicycle to post. But maybe you
                    can't, maybe you're living in an apartment. We lived in an apartment in
                    Argentina, for example, and I used to take my son to a park for him to ride his
                    bicycle. But then the security situation changed, and because [we] were in a
                    somewhat hostile environment as Americans, I couldn't do that. So even the
                    geography, and the topography of a place may [not] allow you to do certain
                    things because of security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, would they say the same thing about Washington, DC
                        these days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's true, that really is true and I think a lot of people have
                    mentioned that. One of the things that I keep in mind always is that I have a
                    lot of choices to where I live. I am not by virtue of my work, and my
                    profession, targeted in any way. When we're at an overseas post, one
                    consideration may be that you are in housing which is predetermined, maybe on a
                    compound, or you're in housing, which is selected by the Embassy. So you don't
                    necessarily have those choices.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>And security, by virtue of being an American in certain places where you are in a
                    threat ... or, indeed, you and your family may be identified. My husband was a
                    target at certain posts in our overseas life as Public Affairs Officer. That's,
                    I think, part of the Washington perspective too.</p>
                <p>That we do have choices. I don't have to go to certain parts of Washington if I
                    don't want to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very true. I'd like to get a clearer picture of how
                        FLO fits into the Department, and whether that has changed since it was
                        first established in 1978. At some point I remember seeing M/FLO, and now
                        it's M/DGP/FLO. So management-wide, who is responsible for FLO, and who do
                        you report to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, actually we have in fact, a new organizational chart, and
                    there's a large one out there, which has always been out there. We are still
                    part of the large area of Management. The Under Secretary for Management is
                    still the person to whom the FLO director reports. That has not changed, and it
                    has never changed since the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what the “M” stands for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's what the “M” stands for, is Management. And Management is the
                    largest area, I think, in the State Department. It includes all of these other
                    offices which are listed here, the Bureau of Administration, Consular Affairs,
                    Finance and Management, Refugees, etc. What has changed ... it's likely I would
                    say, is that the direct reporting that I do, is through the Director General of
                    the Foreign Service. What was done in the last year was that the Under Secretary
                    for Management wanted to group together all of these people-related offices,
                    including MED, the Bureau of Medical Services. And it left the Liaison Office to
                    work with more closely with the Director General, which is what we do. But as
                    you can see from the overall chart, we still are quite a separate
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now you report directly to the Director General's
                        office ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's why the DGP is there. And it really is an appropriate kind of
                    grouping, I think. I meet regularly with the Director General, and with the
                    Director of the Bureau of Medical Services, and other people in the Director
                    General's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How often would you say you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I have a weekly meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I assume based on this structural chart FLO would be
                        funded by the Bureau of Management then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: We're fully funded by the State Department. Our budget does come
                    through the Bureau of Management, but we have a separate budget. Which has meant
                    that we have a fair amount of autonomy in terms of funding the programs that we
                    do. Publications ... that's a big part, support and training of CLOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps you can address the way the responsibilities are
                        spread out in the office? You're the director, and then the number of given
                        areas. The names kind of explain what they're responsible for but perhaps
                        you have some additional things to say? What is currently available in
                        different services.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: One of the things when I first came to the office ... as I said I was
                    aware of what went on here to some extent. I had been the educational counselor
                    in this office for a year before becoming the director, but I still needed to
                    have a really clear sense of how you had this in the office, how did we define
                    the line between providing individual client services. Someone comes through the
                    door, and we do a one-on-one. How do we balance that off with the need to
                    provide a more systematic approach to change? So what I put together was another
                    little chart in the briefing book that I'll give you later. I put together this
                    triangle. It gave me a visual sense of how we were allocating our
                    responsibilities. I have, at the base of the triangle, that this office was
                    established to deal with issues that affect the Foreign Service family as an
                    employee based on the fact that we're living and working and moving. That's why
                    we need to have someone addressing it. The issues that affect the Foreign
                    Service family, and advocating on behalf of those families and employees for
                    positive change. That was the debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: ... families and employees. Well, I really feel that we have to be
                    very careful, and very specific now. The Foreign Service ... our office does not
                    represent only the traditional family. That is, an employee and a wife, and a
                    child. If you were a single employee, you are still going to be impacted by the
                    Foreign Service life. You're going to be impacted by moving every three years.
                    You're going to be impacted by the separation that you have from your extended
                    family, elderly parents; responsibility that you may have for those
                    families.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So, while I think in concept from the time the office was established that was
                    recognized, either in conscious and wanted to make sure that we raise
                    consciousness among all of our clients, that we are here not only for the
                    traditional family, but for the single employee who is part of this whole
                    Foreign Service. So that's at the base. The issues and the advocacy. And that
                    means that we have to spend a lot of time on looking at the individual issue
                    this person brings, and that person brings, and saying, “Should we advocate for
                    some change?” Does this mean that we've got to go to senior management, go to
                    the Congress with legislative changes?</p>
                <p>But in addition to that, we're not just a policy office. We don't sit here behind
                    closed doors and write policy papers. We could, we don't because it was never
                    intended to do just that. It was intended, this office, to be that plus an
                    office where individuals could come in and be assisted.</p>
                <p>I think those two things really are unique in the context of the State
                    Department, and even in other government programs. A lot of governments will
                    have a policy office, but they don't combine it necessarily with a service
                    office. How do we find out what these issues are? That's always a question I
                    keep asking. It's through these client services. When the education officer has
                    seen repeatedly, a particular thing coming up ... I'll give you an example. When
                    she keeps hearing from Foreign Service families that they're sending their
                    children to a junior year abroad ... you send your child from London to a junior
                    year abroad. But the regulations don't permit you to use the educational travel
                    allowance because the child is not in school in the United States. Then that
                    says something to us beyond what the educational counselor can do to help you
                    individually. What it says is that we have to deal with this as an issue. So we
                    would take that, and in the process of working that through the system to try to
                    get legislative change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me that the numbers involved here, and what I
                        mean is that if enough people are asking, looking for certain services, then
                        they become important enough for issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, in a sense that sounds like we don't pay attention unless it
                    something that's endemic. No, I don't think that's necessarily true. If you have
                    an individual issue, for example, you want to find a boarding school for your
                    family, your child, that's one of our client services. The education counselor
                    will meet with you, will take a profile of your child, etc., and specifically
                    work with you to find a boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, of course I understand that part. I guess I'm
                        thinking of the advocacy part that in order to get more benefits, etc.
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Oh, I see what you mean. What you've hit on is really one of the parts
                    of my job, which is to determine the areas that we are going to attempt to
                    institute programs, or advocate for change.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must be a pretty difficult position to be in. How do
                        you really decide what is important enough to push for institutional
                        changes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: We rely on both the clients that bring the issues to us, [and] on the
                    professional staff who are dealing with issues all the time, and looking for a
                    better way, a more efficient way. Not everything needs to have legislative
                    change, but a lot of things can be more effectively dealt with in a systematic
                    way. For example, when we had a few thousand evacuees during the Gulf crisis,
                    lots of people in Washington, lots of people said, “I don't know what to do. I
                    don't know my way around.” Well, what that indicated is beyond helping
                    individuals coming through the door, maybe you ought to have a seminar, a
                    workshop. So we quickly put together with the Overseas Briefing Center a
                    workshop called “Getting reconnected in Washington.” We invited all the evacuees
                    who were in the Washington area, and we notified others who were not in the area
                    in case they might want to come.</p>
                <p>One of the things, I think, that makes this job in the office exciting is that
                    it's not stagnant. If we are finding, for example, that with teenagers we're
                    always finding issues with teenagers. Maybe one of the things that we may do is
                    to send materials overseas to be distributed by the CLOs to families returning
                    to Washington. Again, looking at a more effective and efficient manner of
                    dealing with whatever the issue is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned OBC and organizing a workshop for the
                        evacuees, and also earlier you mentioned the fact that you see FLO as a
                        place for both employees and families that return. I was hoping that you
                        could discuss a little bit about the relationship between FLO and these
                        other organizations such as AFSA, OBC, AAFSW, and how you see FLO fit in
                        with these other organizations, and there may be some others that I don't
                        know of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Often we are confused with OBC, particularly in the field. One may
                    mean the CLOs or the community members. They're not sure whether, “Let's see
                    now, where do you take those courses, at your office or OBC?” “Who has the
                    locator files? Your office or OBC?” “Who has the Post Report?” OBC, which is
                    part of the Foreign Service Institute, is the training arm of the Foreign
                    Service Institute, a family training program, and security overseas. They are in
                    a position principally to tell you what they do, but this is how we kind of
                    differentiate. We are part of the Bureau of Management within the management
                    structure of the State Department, and responsible for advising management on
                    family issues, recommending and implementing programs, managing the overseas CLO
                    program, and providing services in specific areas such as education, spouse
                    employment, personal and community crisis. In fact, the FAM, the Foreign Service
                    Manual, really does detail what our responsibilities are. So the authorization
                    for what we are tasked with doing, is in the Foreign Service Manual.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For FLO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I haven't looked at OBC. I presume they're there too. So we're part of
                    the Bureau of Management, and our responsibilities are advising, recommending,
                    and overseeing programs. OBC is also an official part of [the] federal
                    government. That distinguishes us from AFSA, and AAFSW.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're not part of the State Department. Do you find that
                        you are doing similar or different things than say, AAFSW and AFSA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, I think that we're all ... there are certain concerns that each
                    organization has. How it carries those things out, what it is responsible for
                    doing, is certainly different. I have a much closer relationship with AAFSW than
                    I do with AFSA, so I really can't speak too much to AFSA. But with AAFSW, which
                    is an independent organization, certainly concerns of Foreign Service families,
                    some of the issues that we care about are certainly the thing. I'm a member of
                    AAFSW so I support the goals that AAFSW has. In my role as the director of FLO,
                    I'm responsible to the State Department for carrying out certain jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I presume that you have constant contacts with OBC, with
                        the Director there, and also with the president of AAFSW?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I felt that it was really important for this office to have very close
                    relations with AAFSW, and to that end, when I became the director, I requested
                    of the president that someone from my office attend the board meetings as a
                    guest, and she graciously allowed that. And then I meet regularly with the
                    president, either I or someone from my staff attend the board meetings. I would
                    probably do those things anyway as a member of AAFSW — go to the board meetings
                    and some of the other things. But in my role as the director of this office, I
                    think it's important for us to maintain a close relationship so that certain
                    issued that AAFSW would be lobbying for that are of interest to us, we could
                    discuss.</p>
                <p>We don't lobby. FLO does not lobby. I am part of the State Department. I am not
                    separate from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But AAFSW is independent, so in a way they can sort of
                        define things, the things that they want to do with a little bit more
                        freedom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I would say that in the area of lobbying for legislative change, AAFSW
                    has really a very strong history.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how did the two help each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think we can help each other because we have some common goals. We
                    recognize that we're all of the Foreign Service. What I do in this office
                    programmatically is very different from what AAFSW does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But to the same end for things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Yes, and frankly there are other people in the State Department, the
                    Director General of the State Department cares about the Foreign Service, and
                    works in different ways toward bettering the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it fair to say that you don't offer training as such,
                        so when you feel that a certain kind of training is necessary that you would
                        turn to OBC for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: OBC or someone else in the Foreign Service Institute, not necessarily
                    OBC. For instance, one of the things I had as a goal when I became director
                    regarding the CLO program was to establish CLO training, professional CLO
                    training in Washington just as we have training for administrative officers,
                    B&amp;F officers, or personnel, etc. I mentioned that I had attended a regional
                    conference overseas, and I wanted to continue with that but I wanted to add
                    something. I wanted to have professional CLO training. So one of the first
                    things I did as director was to discuss with the director of the Foreign Service
                    Institute who at that time was Brandon Grove, or he was by the time I started
                    this program, to discuss with him and the Dean of the School of Professional
                    Studies, how we could cooperate in offering training to CLOs, and not through
                    the Overseas Briefing Center, but through the School of Professional Studies
                    because this would be for CLO employees. So I turned to them and I got an
                    agreement from them to provide — not by giving money to bring the CLOs here, but
                    by providing a trainer to help us design the program. So the School of
                    Professional Studies has now offered — I guess we began in 1988, the first year
                    that I was here — a CLO training program. It has a number, I don't know ... MQ,
                    or whatever, and we have a trainer from the School of Professional Studies who
                    has worked with us, and we designed it together, and then we give it jointly.
                    Obviously a lot of the content for presentation comes from this office, but the
                    design and the training has been supported by FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that most of the time you don't get [training
                        whle] working overseas, so who is to go to the CLO training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: CLOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they have done the jobs overseas, and then they would
                        come back here for the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I started out by having a CLO training program once a year, September,
                    notifying posts worldwide then selecting from among those nominated, the newest
                    CLOs. The first year I think we brought 20, which is consistent with other kinds
                    of training done for professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you perhaps give me a rough idea of what is included
                        in this CLO professional training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: This is what's so interesting because what I was trying to do, and I
                    shouldn't say just I, Terry Williams who was the CLO support officer and who
                    joined the staff shortly after I became director, we really worked together on
                    this. It was one of biggest first goals. What we wanted to do was to bring the
                    CLOs here, and we wanted to do generic training: what makes you a better CLO?
                    How do you assess the community? How do you communicate? How do you do a
                    briefing? How do you learn to work within the bureaucracy, on your post?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I see the professional aspect that you were talking
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's what we were aiming at, so what we did was we designed a
                    program, and we had the CLOs off-site just as they do for the A-100 training. We
                    worked on these various segments: more effective meetings, and some of the
                    things that you really have to do as a CLO. Now mind you, not only as a CLO if
                    you're an Admin officer, but we were focusing on what is really important. So we
                    had a segment on effective meetings, on MBTI [Meyers/Briggs Temperament
                    Indicator], we do the type indicator at the beginning part of the training to
                    help the CLO identify her own, or his own, strengths. And then to recognize
                    profiles of other people. And then we go through some segments on influencing,
                    and how to accept change, depending upon the kind of people you have around you.
                    More effective meetings, communications, presentations, cultural skills, and
                    what it means to be a professional. So, that's the kind of generic stuff that we
                    do off-site. We do that at a training facility in West Virginia, somewhere
                    off-site for three days. And then we bring the group here to the State
                    Department and we have three days of training here so that the CLOs can meet
                    Department Officials. (End Tape 1, Side A)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: The CLO training, and I really have to tell you this. I'm still very
                    excited about it because it was a dream in my mind from the time I was a CLO,
                    and I said how excited I was about having gone to the CLO regional conference.
                    Well, I recognized that probably wasn't enough. We needed something generic that
                    could be given and could go across regional lines. So, I said that we bring them
                    off-site, and we do this generic professional development. And then we come back
                    to the State Department, and they have a chance to have briefings with, and
                    consultations with their bureaus, and to learn what is the linkage between the
                    post and the bureau. They meet with the Office of Overseas Schools. And one of
                    the new things that we developed within the past year was a segment on crisis
                    management. Have you been abroad yet?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: You've got a lot of exciting things in store. One of the things that
                    the Diplomatic Security Bureau does, they go overseas and they do what are
                    called CME, Crisis Management Exercise, and they do that also as part of the
                    training for security officers. What it is is a simulation, a two-day simulation
                    of a real crisis. And the participants are members of the Country Team, and they
                    are working under a compressed time period with a progressively deteriorating
                    situation. That could be a proposed attack on the school, a bomb threat, and in
                    fact, real things happening. And the participants each have a job, one person is
                    the CLO, one is the Admin officer, one is the Public Affairs Officer, etc. A
                    real simulation, but it's so well done that you really get a lot of adrenaline
                    flowing.</p>
                <p>I have felt that with the increased responsibility that the CLO has during a
                    crisis, that I wanted to beef up this part of our training. So I went to the
                    people in Diplomatic Security, and worked with them and got their concurrence to
                    develop a simulation crisis management exercise one-half day that we could do
                    here for CLOs during the training program. They designed a sort of shortened
                    version of what they use overseas, and what they use for the regional security
                    officers. It's very exciting, and it's a very useful learning tool. So the CLOs
                    then here participate in a crisis management exercise right here in the task
                    force. What they go away with is a recognition of what happens in a crisis, what
                    their role is because one of them is the CLO, and what other people are doing.
                    What happens in Washington. So what they're going away with, I think, is a
                    tremendous learning. So we've added that to the Washington part of the
                    training.</p>
                <p>We have people from the Bureau of Medical Services who come and talk with the
                    CLOs about confidentiality, referral. How to limit what they're doing. And then
                    we have members of [the] FLO staff, and that's a key part of it. When we go
                    abroad to a regional conference, I can't bring everybody from the staff, but
                    when we bring the CLOs here, they get a chance to see Washington, and to consult
                    with all of the players back here. So it's a very rich experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the duties of the day, of the week? What
                        kind of things do you normally have to deal with in say a week's
                        schedule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I start out my week on Monday mornings with a small meeting in the
                    Director General's office, where I meet with the Director General; with the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary in her office; Dr. Kemp, who is the Director of
                    Medical Services; and also someone from the Legal staff — it's a small meeting.
                    And that gives us a kind of up-date on what's coming up for the week in each of
                    our areas. We highlight issues that are of interest to the Director General,
                    medical areas, etc. So it really gives us a kind of broad brush. And at that
                    same time we'll have a discussion on some things that have gone on in the past
                    week that we all want to discuss. We get a chance to hear what the Director
                    General is going to be doing for that week.</p>
                <p>That's one of the key times for me to take some of these issues and mention them.
                    Either mention them just so I'm dropping the seed, or bringing up something that
                    later on in the week I may be sending up an issue paper on, or requesting a
                    decision on. So that's a very important beginning part of my week within the
                    structure of the State Department management.</p>
                <p>Then one of the first things I have to do, and I try to do that before I go to
                    that meeting, is to read the daily traffic. We get cable traffic from everywhere
                    in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the traffic that comes into FLO directly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's correct. We get a stack of about an inch of cable traffic which
                    comes from posts. Some of it is for our action, some of it is just info-ing us.
                    For example, we'll get the material that's specifically for us — e.g., the CLO
                    reports, the activity reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a weekly thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: No, we get those three times a year, they dribble in. We would get
                    action material about changes in the CLO program: somebody is coming on board,
                    or they're leaving, or there's a change in their hours. We get requests for
                    materials. And we get confidential cable traffic as well. So I get two stacks of
                    traffic that has to be read every day. And then there's action on it by
                    different members of the staff. But I have to read everything, and then I pass
                    it on to my deputy director and she reads everything as well.</p>
                <p>I usually meet with my deputy director every day. We don't have a formal meeting
                    time, but we see what's happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the current deputy director is Kendall
                        Montgomery.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: We divide, in general here, anything that has to do with policy with
                    the Family Liaison office goes through me. And Kendall deals with all
                    administrative matters in the office, and personnel matters. So what we're doing
                    every day is work on what's happening. If we've read the morning paper, and
                    there's been some bombing in Venezuela, had we heard anything? Is there anything
                    going on? Are there meetings that we have to attend? So we're very much tied in
                    to what's happening all over the world on a daily basis. Either we'd get a call
                    from another office, or one of the other staff members, Joanne Vaugh, who is the
                    support services, she may have even been called at home if there's something
                    going on, and would give me a briefing on that. So there's a lot of sort of
                    daily stuff in keeping up with what's happening worldwide.</p>
                <p>I go to a lot of regular meetings as well, and part of my work is staying in
                    touch with other offices within the State Department through regular contact. I
                    attend a meeting of all executive directors of the regional bureaus, and other
                    bureaus in the State Department, which is chaired by the Director General. So I
                    have a little card that has all of my meetings on it. Some of them are monthly,
                    but when you add all of them up, there's a lot of those to go to. I said the
                    regular weekly meeting with the Director General. We have a staff meeting in the
                    Family Liaison office with his staff. Then I attend another meeting with all of
                    the office directors for the Bureau of Personnel. So one part of my work is
                    that.</p>
                <p>I see staff members throughout the day, and it might be something on a policy
                    question. For example, some staff member just today, just before I came in here,
                    wanted to know what would I suggest that she do in a particular case involving a
                    client. She would come to me if there's some question about the policy, how
                    involved should she become in a personal family issue. When should we refer this
                    to someone else. In divorce cases, which are always difficult, how do we provide
                    client service, and not overstep what is appropriate for a government office to
                    do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you do get into the daily work as well. You are in tune
                        with what goes on here as well as what goes on in the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Oh, yes. This is why I think it's a great job.</p>
                <p>I think it's just a wonderful job, and I have to say this is my fifth year, and
                    it's my final year. And I have absolutely loved every minute of it, even the
                    very tough times because it's a combination of individual work, and people. I
                    see people as well. I don't have a whole client base as some of the other people
                    in the office do, but I have standing orders to my receptionist that if someone
                    wants to see me, that they should be put through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The way you run the office, is that your personal choice
                        of how you want things done, or has it always been done in a similar fashion
                        so the deputy tends to do with the administrative, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think every director has had a personal style, but the
                    responsibilities of my position are different from the deputy director which is
                    the deputy director/administrative officer. So that definitely does have
                    administrative responsibilities. And I am tasked with public liaison as well. So
                    part of what I do is work with other agencies, although we're fully funded by
                    the State Department and part of the State Department. We work with all of the
                    foreign affairs agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA and ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: ... USIA, AID, Foreign Commercial Service, Foreign Agriculture
                    Service, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. There are six foreign affairs
                    agencies. They are official foreign affairs agencies. But there are a number of
                    other agencies that send people overseas to our embassies and consulates. All of
                    those people we consider part of our client base, and we consider their concerns
                    our concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they don't contribute to the funding, do they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, we are part of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the other foreign affairs agencies would all be under
                        State Department as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: No, the foreign affairs agencies are independent, but they work
                    closely together. The Director General chairs a meeting regularly, which I
                    sometimes attend as well, called the Board of the Foreign Service. The Board of
                    the Foreign Service is composed of representatives from the other agencies who
                    meet formally to discuss official liaison. All the foreign affairs agencies
                    subscribe to the standard regulations, for example. So there are official joint
                    agreements. So when I call on my colleagues in USIA, I'm informing them about
                    the programs that we have, and I often will go into a briefing. So that's
                    another thing that I do, and other staff members do as well. Next week I'm going
                    to USIA and I'll be briefing the director of Foreign Service personnel and his
                    staff on some of the new programs that we have, and passing out some of the
                    materials that we have. So that they in turn can be informing their people
                    here.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>But beyond the foreign affairs agencies which have these official links anyway,
                    we maintain liaison with the other agencies like DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency.
                    They send a lot of people overseas. We speak at their training programs. DIA,
                    Defense Intelligence Agency, has people at most of our embassies as well. We
                    speak not only at the attach� training, but to the attach� spouse training. I
                    think that's important because some of the things that we do, almost everything
                    that we do, will affect those people as well. And some of the other agencies
                    send a very small number of people overseas, and they're not going to have a
                    whole separate support structure. So part of my work is that kind of liaison
                    with the other agencies that send people abroad under the Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're really a unifying force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think so. I think that's a good way of putting it. I really feel
                    that's something you need about this office. When we talk about spouse
                    employment, we're not talking about employment of State Department spouses only.
                    We're talking about the impact of moving every three years, and how that affects
                    you whether you're with DEA, or State Department, or DIA, or some other agency.
                    I really think that that has been a kind of unique aspect, and is still a unique
                    aspect of this work.</p>
                <p>You started asking what do I do on a daily basis. I come in, I read the traffic,
                    I always go around to talk to everybody in the office. Our offices have always
                    been here. We have extended a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed. I heard from Stephanie, that this started out
                        as a clothes closet with three people, and that was all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: And it was still right here. In fact this was the closet. We've added
                    what used to be a corridor and that was a big help because we didn't have a
                    reception area, we just had a little office here. One of my regular meetings is
                    with the Deputy Assistant Secretary in charge of operations, and throughout my
                    regular meetings with him — it was a previous person — I kept saying, “We're
                    busting out of here. We need some more space.” I said, “Why can't we use the
                    corridor, just put up a wall.” For years we had heard that you can't because
                    it's marble out there, and blah, blah. Anyway, I got an agreement from him, and
                    within a very short time we had put up a wall and we had our reception area
                    which really increased our space a lot. So those meetings with other people in
                    the Department, I think, are really important.What else I do on sort of a daily
                    basis? I will proofread publications that are coming out. So I guess on a daily
                    basis, the director of the FLO office is a manager of the programs that we are
                    responsible for. A person that people want to talk to. People will call from
                    overseas and they want to talk about a personal concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to get back to one thing about your meetings with
                        the other offices in the State Department. How is FLO perceived by the other
                        offices in the State Department? What's your impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think they look at this office as an office with a good deal of
                    commitment, and an office to pay attention to. And I think that due to a steady
                    progression over the years from its conception of a serious work. I think the
                    people that proceeded me in this position, and other staff members of the
                    office, have been very professional. And its an office that should be considered
                    when people think of quality of life, when they think of families. I think they
                    recognize that we're the office that deals with those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that FLO is sufficiently well known in the
                        State Department as to its functions, and focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think that within the State Department we're very well known. And I
                    think we've come a long way in terms of exposure within the State Department. I
                    have briefed Secretary Shultz, and then Baker, Assistant Secretaries, and part
                    of the Foreign Service in Ambassadorial seminars for the past five years, and
                    Ambassadors in the field who havn't had a part of his briefing from [FLO]. I
                    briefed individual Ambassadors, and DCMs, and Admin officers one-on-one in
                    addition to speaking at the Ambassadorial seminar. So I would say that within
                    the State Department that we're well known, and I think respected.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I do also regularly is to brief inspectors. And there are
                    teams of inspectors who go out to embassies; they have to be inspected
                    periodically. When those people are preparing to go to do the inspection, they
                    meet with a lot of different people here to get prepared. We send those teams
                    copies of reports from the CLOs, and then we brief them individually. For
                    example, I had someone in yesterday going to Lima. So we see a lot of people,
                    either one-on-one, or in the presentations that we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's nice that you also reach up to the highest levels of
                        the embassies, mainly the ambassadors, and the DCMs, because I'm sure that
                        that would help when they get overseas to know what kind of things FLO
                        offers to families in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think that's important because the Ambassador can often set the
                    tone. One of the things that we're talking about in this office when I meet with
                    the ambassadors, or with the DCMs, has to do with the morale of an embassy, and
                    what you can do about it. I can't tell an ambassador how to be an ambassador;
                    I'm not the person to do that. But a lot of the information we have, the
                    experiential and the anecdotal evidence that we have, we're very happy to pass
                    on. What works? And that's the kind of thing we share, as well as particular
                    stuff on the post. We can provide a profile on the post which is very different
                    from the Post Report. Because of the reports we have, because of the deeper
                    things we have from CLOs. And from the post visits that I made, and other staff
                    members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really provide a worldwide perspective that someone
                        going out as an ambassador would need, and would be very useful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think that's why they continue to come for that kind of briefing.
                    What's it going to be like out there? What are the pitfalls. What kind of things
                    should I pay attention to in terms of morale, or quality of life? I would say
                    that in the State Department we're pretty well known, and that's a testimony, I
                    think, to all the people who have been here before me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good, good. I'm sure you've done a lot too in the five
                        years you've been here. To follow up on the CLO program, the professional
                        training, would you tell me about some of the pending issues, current
                        issues, that FLO is involved with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, the positions in FLO, when this office was established, it was
                    established as excepted service, although there are other offices, or positions,
                    that are excepted service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean exactly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: It means that these positions are not career conditional. These are
                    not regular civil service positions, although I hold a civil service grade. But
                    from working here I don't get career status to move into another position. These
                    are unique positions. They were established to be a two-year time limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For all the positions as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's right. It was found out that really two years was a very short
                    time, and it was later extended to five years. So we are a five-year limited
                    appointment. Its more in a sense to what Peace Corps staff are. Peace Corps
                    positions are five year limits. So there is a history in the federal government
                    for that. The philosophy behind that was that these positions would be staffed
                    by professionals, but they would not be positions into which civil service move.
                    So that you wouldn't go from being in one office down the hall, into another.
                    And I think that still makes sense. So this is my fifth year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it's almost like preventing other civil service people
                        from getting into FLO. Am I understanding it correctly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, it isn't so much that as these are not career conditional. They
                    don't provide someone from this position here, as a stepping stone into the
                    regular civil service. They were established really, as you can imagine, to be
                    staffed by people who have had overseas experience. And that's still a very
                    important part. Everyone on this staff comes from the ranks of having experience
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that they're all spouses — male or female?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Yes. One is the daughter of a Foreign Service. But everyone has had
                    experience in the Foreign Service context, and I think that is still very
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we touch on that, you were starting to say ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: This is my fifth year — in May I will have completed my fifth year,
                    and it will be the fifteenth year of the establishment of the FLO office. A
                    director at a historic year during the tenth year, the anniversary year of this
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did you succeed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I followed Sue Parsons, and she was actually the director at the time
                    that we celebrated the tenth anniversary. I was on the staff of the educational
                    counselor, and during that period applied for the directorship. So from that
                    historical perspective for me it's very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, from the tenth to the fifteenth, that's a pretty
                        impressive time there. Perhaps then you can tell me what were the kind of
                        things that ... we kind of covered that along [the] way, but the kind of
                        things that you were handed with, if you will, when you took over as the
                        director, and now as you will be leaving in May, what are the current
                        concerns and things that you would like to have done by the time you
                        leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: When I came in, we were looking at I would say some changes in the
                    Foreign Service, and in the American society, regarding the two income family.
                    During these five years that I've been here, I think that a recognition of a two
                    career, the two income is so much more a part of American society, and has
                    impacted on the Foreign Service in a way that had been a little less before that
                    time. So one of my concerns was, what can we be doing about this? A lot had
                    already been done. We had established the program of bilateral work agreements,
                    but we have during these five years seen an increase in the number of bilateral
                    work agreements. And I think that's a renewed push for analyzing, and
                    recommending, and establishing some programs to deal with that kind of change.
                    In these five years the people coming into the Foreign Service now, I think,
                    have an expectation of career opportunities, and a greater expectation of
                    information. I mean the information management changes in our society have been
                    tremendous in the last five years. People expect to have computers, to have
                    on-line programs. So one of the challenges I have had, I think, is in
                    information management. How can we reach people, the thousands of people
                    overseas who are at embassies and consulates who don't necessarily come through
                    Washington? How can we make them aware of programs, or what it's like to raise
                    children overseas, or how to access information. That's our role in information
                    management. That's been one real challenge.</p>
                <p>A second has been in the area of spouse employment, and as I mentioned, I think,
                    in these five years the increase in the expectation of a second career.</p>
                <p>A third, I think, has been a real increase in the dangers, and if not an increase
                    in the danger, certainly a more awareness on our part of the crisis, and
                    security issues overseas. And my desire to continue to deal with those in a
                    systematic way.</p>
                <p>Other issues that I'm still dealing with, and I'm going to pass on to my
                    successor, dealing with elderly parents is a main concern in our society. And
                    think of the impact of the Foreign Service overlay. I mean, if you are living
                    here ... I lived in Washington, my family lives in Massachusetts, not that far
                    away, nevertheless when my mother became ill and I started considering what
                    would I do — what will I do if she can't stay at home with my father? What will
                    I do? What resources are available to us in Massachusetts? How will I deal with
                    it? I work full time here, how much can my brother and his wife, my
                    sister-in-law ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you in DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Then add to that, if I lived in Kuala Lumpur? Or Paraguay? Or Beijing?
                    Or Greece? So I think that that's a very, very big issue which is still facing
                    us. I mean, as part of our society it doesn't get any easier if you're in the
                    Foreign Service context. I'm not going to have an answer to it in this office
                    but one of the things that I think we have to do, and are doing, is to provide
                    some information to people in the far flung corners of the world. And there
                    certainly will be some legislative things that we're facing too. More people are
                    taking dependent parents with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: So those are the kinds of things that I think are on our plate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the divorced partners, or displaced
                        partners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Actually divorce in the Foreign Service is as much an issue as it is
                    in American society. Everything that happens in American society, happens in the
                    Foreign Service. And because of being abroad, I think the difficulties of
                    dealing with it because of access to information, institutional support
                    structures, are different. They're not there. So what you have, I think, are the
                    same issues, but intensified. In the last year the publications that we've put
                    together, I think, sort of shows any areas that have been of so much concern. In
                    the last year we produced a booklet, The Foreign Service Family and Divorce. We
                    produced adoption guidelines for the Foreign Service family. Again, something
                    which isn't a problem, it might be something you're just looking forward to
                    doing. But how do you find out about it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just the logistics of how things are done sometimes.
                        Because that also helps you figure out the kind of problems you may face
                        individually. You may not have thought about the way of how to do something
                        until you have the information, and then you can consider, “Well, this
                        doesn't really suit me.” That is important too, it's not really just dealing
                        with the problems when they come up, but providing information before you
                        have the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Exactly. So it isn't all these problems. Assignment in Washington.
                    There's an update on a publication that we did to assist people returning to
                    Washington. It gives a wealth of information. What do I do now? is a source book
                    on regulations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that also come up ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: This was joint, a publication between OBC and FLO. These were done
                    here. Evacuation guidelines. Don't leave home without them, we published a lot
                    of those. That kind of thing I think shows what we're trying to do in the area
                    of pulling together information that's going to help people make good
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... is what I have been hearing both at FLO and OBC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about children of the Foreign Service? Have their
                        concerns changed since you became director here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: One of the exciting things that has happened since I became director,
                    it just happened. It's not even on this staff list, is the establishment of a
                    new position, and it will be listed as AFMA, American Family Members Associates
                    Coordinator, that's an unemployment program. But in addition to dealing with the
                    AFMA program, this staff member has responsibility to be the youth
                    coordinator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is brand new?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Brand new. She is on board now, her name is Karen Lundahl., and she's
                    the AFMA coordinator, and youth program coordinator.</p>
                <p>A couple of interesting things have happened. One which I'm very proud of is
                    somewhat outside the office, and that's the establishment of the Foreign Service
                    Youth Foundation which I'm a founding member of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that AWAL?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: No, no. AWAL is Around the World in a Lifetime, which is a teen group.
                    The Foreign Service Youth Foundation was established just a couple of years ago
                    as an umbrella organization. It has tax-free status so that it cold provide
                    support to AWAL, it could be an advocacy group, and it could be somewhat
                    independent. That began really as a result of a lot of interest, apart from what
                    I could do in the office. There are certain things that I can't do from the
                    office, but that we can't do, that an independent organization can do and that's
                    part of how the Foreign Service Youth Foundation came about. But I also felt
                    that we wanted to focus in the office officially on youth issues. So that's why
                    I wanted to get a part of this new staff person dealing with youth issues. And
                    she will be the linkage to our overseas posts in helping them either get some
                    teen programs established. Keep in touch with CLOs on kids who are coming back
                    to the States. I guess from my own experience, I had a child who was three years
                    old when we started [in] the Foreign Service and who is now 28. So his entire
                    life really was as a Foreign Service child. And a lot of the things I know now,
                    I wish I knew when I was a young parent. But maybe we ought to talk about that a
                    little later, I don't know how we're doing on time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're fine. I'm still interested in a little bit more on
                        the youth programs, and whether there have been changes, and the concerns of
                        the younger sector, if you will, of the Foreign Service. What are they
                        worried about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: What are the young people worried about? Well, I'll tell you — this is
                    really interesting. One of the things that we've been doing for the last few
                    years is having what we call dialogues, with the cooperation of USIA, United
                    States Information Agency, and their Worldnet program, or the other
                    communications satellite things they have. We get a team of kids here, and a
                    group of kids at a post overseas, for example, Cairo, and it's live. The kids in
                    Cairo will ask a question from the group of kids here — kids in Cairo who are
                    going to be coming back. So we did that with about five posts overseas at
                    different locations, and the kinds of questions they asked in preparation for
                    coming here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things that they wouldn't ask their parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: If they did, they wouldn't listen to the answers, they didn't care
                    what their parents thought, and they certainly didn't want to ask these
                    questions of other adults. Things like they wanted to know about were: what's
                    the drug situation like? Am I going to be pressured in America, coming back
                    here, concerns about that. How much do kids drink? What about the sexual mores?
                    Remember, here they are, they're in Cairo, or they're in Nairobi, or they're in
                    Santiago, and they're going to come back. They're going to go to high school
                    here. Everybody has sexual questions these days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At fifteen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: At fifteen, I mean, am I going to feel like I have to? Well, the
                    reason I said that they were not going to ask me, or ask you, or ask their
                    parents, is that we're going to give them our views. They want to know from
                    their peers. What's it really like? A new one this year was violence. How much
                    violence is there in American schools? This is what we read about, this is what
                    we see. Do people really carry weapons? How am I going to fit in? So I would say
                    for the last couple of years we've been hearing questions about alcohol, [and]
                    drugs. But violence was new this year. A bottom line thing that they're always
                    concerned about is, how am I going to make friends? And how do they look? What
                    are they wearing? What are kids wearing these days? Quite honestly though with
                    CNN in so many places overseas, there is less feeling of isolation. So kids
                    abroad are seeing more than they used to five years ago. But they're still
                    concerned about, how am I going to fit in. And they're really concerned about
                    behavior, and attitudes, and these things that we hear so much about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not hearing here actually something equal, if you
                        will, that they feel somewhat isolated. They don't really know their country
                        in a way that they need from first hand information. These questions that
                        they're asking seem to be things that they have read in papers and
                        magazines, on TV, in movies, etc., but they probably have spent most of
                        their lives overseas, and they really need some kind of support,
                        information, to come back to in order to emigrate into America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's it exactly. If you are fifteen, and you're coming back to go to
                    high school here, and you've spent the last three years overseas, it's
                    different. If you spent the last five years, you haven't been a teenager in the
                    United States. So that's exactly one of our concerns, and one of our problematic
                    focuses. What can we do? What kinds of information can we send out? We sent out
                    packets of material to the CLOs to distribute to the kids. All kinds of stuff,
                    articles that other kids have written on dress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Written by kids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Yes, written by kids. The AWAL group produces an international edition
                    of their newsletter once a year in the spring. We send that worldwide, and some
                    of the articles that kids have written are, “How to Get Around in Washington”.

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maryann, we were talking about the concerns of youth
                        foundations the last time, and I think you have a few things you'd like to
                        say about the youth problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, I think our children, the Foreign Service young people who
                    travel with us around the world, or are born overseas, or are moved back and
                    forth, are among the most interesting people in this whole Foreign Service
                    community. And from my own experience of going abroad as a young Foreign Service
                    wife with a three year old to Guatemala, and having that child of ours go to
                    school for the first time in kindergarten where his playmates were Spanish
                    speaking, and observing his integration into the world community, I think that
                    has been one of the most exciting parts of my husband's and my life in the
                    Foreign Service. And I think one of the things that has been most impressive to
                    me, is recognizing that our kids are tremendously resilient. At the same time I
                    think that there are some predictable things that occur when children are moved,
                    things of identity. When people say, “Where are you from?” You know, it's one of
                    those throw-away lines, how many times in your life do people say, “Oh, where
                    are you from?” And I'm sure that some of this same identity issue is true of a
                    foreign born spouse. So with the Foreign Service kids who may have been born ...
                    my son, for example, was born in Spain. We happen to be of Italian background,
                    and our name is Italian, my home, and my husband's original home, were both in
                    Massachusetts. And yet my son spent all of his life in places like Guatemala,
                    Honduras and Argentina, speaking Spanish; and then in the Middle East and back
                    and forth to Washington.</p>
                <p>So that kind of throw-away line, “Where are you from?” to a Foreign Service kid
                    can have a whole lot ... so the business of identity, I think, is one that is
                    important. I think there are times in the development of a young person who is
                    moving around the world, there are times that are more critical than others in
                    the need for support. And it is that that has interested me as a parent for many
                    years and for the last several years as a professional. So I think the work that
                    I have been doing with young people ... some years ago I was at the Overseas
                    Briefing Center. I had a contract of what is called the Youth Programs
                    Coordinator. And since then the work of the Foreign Service Youth Foundation
                    around the world, has been really rewarding. What I think I am very pleased and
                    proud of, is the fact that today I think the State Department, through the
                    Family Liaison Office, and through the Overseas Briefing Center, and with AAFSW,
                    all are interested in providing a very definite support for our young people at
                    this critical time.</p>
                <p>We now have developed ... actually what we've done is we put down on paper what
                    we're calling the Flow of Care. It really is simply a way of saying, “Here is
                    what we, all of these organizations, Office of Overseas Schools, we all have a
                    little part of it” And we are pointing out what we are officially doing as a
                    young person, as a Foreign Service kid, is preparing to go overseas. What kinds
                    of things can be provided in an overseas environment, and then what happens when
                    they come back. And what we're doing is a whole series of things from
                    preparation, or through seminars, and workshops for young people, to worldwide
                    dialogues when kids are overseas and ready to come back. Did I mention that the
                    last time we talked?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: With USIS, the U.S. Information Service, with their cooperation, and
                    their facilities, we have been able to get in the spring groups of young people,
                    at various locations overseas, South America, Africa, the Far East, and Europe,
                    groups of kids together asking questions, and having a dialogue with a panel of
                    Foreign Service teens here. So that's an example of the kinds of things we are
                    now doing on a regular basis. This will be the third year.</p>
                <p>So when I say I'm proud, I think there are many, many people who have contributed
                    to: a recognition of what our kids need; and a determination to put something
                    into place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last time you also mentioned that the kids asked about
                        the questions on drugs, alcohol, sex, morale, and also grades. Was there
                        something else that you would like to add to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I thought they were very revealing in terms of what kids overseas
                    perceive is the youth scene here, and some of their real worries and concerns.
                    They were worried about how safe it was in schools here. They were worried about
                    the pressures that might be put on them to change their behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there something about race, and problems in South
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, not so much race problems. I think when we were talking to kids
                    from Africa, they wondered what perception the kids here had of people from
                    other countries. They wouldn't name it necessarily cross-cultural, but it was
                    cross-cultural and it was race. Our kids are very perceptive. Anyway, so those
                    things to me have been very exciting. And what I look forward to is that this
                    office, and the other organizations and offices, will continue to focus on
                    what's important to helping our kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in terms of raising children? Does the office
                        try to work on a profile, predictable, behavior of children so you can help
                        out the parents overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's exactly, I think, what we're working on. People like Dr.
                    Rigamer, the State Department psychologist, has written very widely on
                    resiliency. And he has been in a number of video tapes. So he identifies and
                    helps parents recognize that when kids are about to leave the United States,
                    leave Washington to go overseas, there's going to be a period of loss. There's
                    going to be a real down time, and what helps is giving young people the
                    opportunity to bring their own things. That's true for adults too. And sometimes
                    the parents ... I know I've done this when we were moving from one place to
                    another, and I'd say, “Oh, I don't want to go, I don't want to leave Honduras.
                    I've got my friends here.” And my husband would say, “Oh, but you're going to
                    love it where we're going.” Well, that was okay to say. I felt I had to, but one
                    of the things Dr. Rigamer has said is, “Yes, I'm going to miss it too.”</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So it's that kinds of thing. I'm not a real specialist, but what I've tried to do
                    is to provide opportunities in a way for groups of people to come together with
                    the specialists that can help us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you can give me an update on the survey that the
                        office is doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, we are embarking on that, and we have ... I think mentioned in
                    our last meeting, that we have contracted with a firm that does research. So
                    that what we're planning on doing is a worldwide survey which will in a very
                    professional way focus on what the issues are for family members and employees.
                    A broad category of quality of life in the Foreign Service. We have a lot of
                    [experience] and we've done surveys before, surveys that we've constructed
                    ourselves. And what I've learned by talking with these specialists, researchers,
                    is that in order to really have some statistical stability in value, to have a
                    certain number, and you have to present questions in a certain way. And that's
                    what we're doing. But the purpose of this is to be able to look at the whole
                    overseas community. And I think as I mentioned before, that's not State
                    Department only, and it's not foreign affairs agencies only. Our community
                    overseas ... if you look at Tokyo, if you look at Buenos Aires, if you look at
                    Abidjan, you say, “Okay, this is the official American community.” The people
                    who are part of that are from as many as 28 different federal government
                    agencies, all of whom come under the umbrella of the chief of mission. And that
                    could include agencies such as Customs, Drug Enforcement agencies, Justice,
                    Library of Congress, Defense Intelligence agencies.</p>
                <p>So I think our interest is, what is the overseas official community like? What
                    are the dynamics of it? What are some of the demographics? So we're working
                    through, right now, the questions of what we will be able to get from these
                    responses, what we want to find out. We hope to have more on that at some future
                    time, but right now we're in the early stages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would that be furnished to everybody overseas, officers,
                        employees, as well as dependents or families?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: It will go to employees and dependents. It will not go to every single
                    one. This is how the researchers can help us. (noise on tape) ... bring in a
                    sample both of posts and people in order to get the kind of responses that will
                    be useful. But we will use posts worldwide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maryann, I mentioned last time about the Rockefeller and I
                        was wondering what FLO's official view is on that? Perhaps you can explain a
                        little bit to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Senator Rockefeller proposed legislation which addressed the issue of
                    jobs in embassies overseas that are held by Foreign Service Nationals, FSN jobs,
                    FSN positions. His proposal dealt with opening those jobs to Americans.
                    Essentially what he was saying was — I have read the legislation — is that those
                    jobs which are presently held by Foreign Service Nationals should not be
                    restricted to Foreign Service Nationals. They should be open to all Americans.
                    The emphasis for that, I believe, came from resident Americans overseas who want
                    to have access to these jobs. “[This is] my embassy and I want to have a job
                    that I see a host country national doing, and I know I can't. Here I am an
                    American.” That's the situation, particularly in western Europe where we have
                    large embassies, and fairly large staffs of nationals, and staffed with a wage
                    scale of Foreign Service Nationals is fairly high. So in that environment
                    Rockefeller was responding to his constituency who pushed for this kind of
                    legislation. When he proposed it, and once it got passed, Foreign Service jobs
                    cannot be restricted to Foreign Service Nationals. When they become available,
                    they have to be advertised for all Americans. Well, that also then includes
                    American spouses in the embassy. So that's basically what the legislation
                    says.</p>
                <p>Now, where do we stand on it, and what are our concerns? One of my concerns is
                    that as this is implemented, and jobs are open, that spouses of Americans who
                    are assigned to the embassy will continue to have preference. The regulations
                    now indicate that if a candidate applies for a position, that the spouse has
                    preference in the hiring. And the reason for that is because of our continuous
                    movement we are hindered from developing a career path. So that's the sense
                    behind that and I think it's been very important. My understanding from Senator
                    Rockefeller's office is that he doesn't have any intention of trying to remove
                    that preference. If that's true, then I think that would allay one of my
                    concerns, and one of my fears.</p>
                <p>Another is that if an American resident does get the job that is now held by a
                    Foreign Service National, and that resident American lives there for 20 years,
                    then in effect, that job is just held by someone and it really doesn't open up
                    anything to us either. So those are the two concerns that I have. That said, I
                    think it is possible, and I think what we in this office have to work on, and
                    we'll certainly do that is consultation with AAFSW and with the rest of the
                    State Department, is to ensure that the standard procedures now for incoming —
                    that our own people continue to have more openings than they had before. What we
                    have to do is to try and make it work. And that's where I am.</p>
                <p>The OP, Operating Procedures, for implementing this legislation has not been
                    finalized. They have to be worked out in the State Department. What that means
                    is they've got to now figure out, how are you going to advertise. And what
                    happens if a national applies and two or three Americans, how are they
                    evaluated, and judged. So that's the kind of thing that's now being
                    developed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it is possible that the American overseas would have
                        the same kind of terms of employment as a spouse would have, that they can
                        only keep a position for a couple of years, and not forever. Otherwise it
                        would be just like a Foreign Service National.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Exactly. That's what the guidelines now will address, but we haven't
                    gotten anything finalized. But all I think all of the parties who are working on
                    this, people in the other offices in the State Department, AAFSW, etc. I think
                    we now have to simply say, okay, these are the things we want, we don't want to
                    hurt any group. We want to make sure that the ones that we represent are going
                    to get the best possible situation. So I think it could work. The best possible
                    [thing] this could mean that there will be more openings for Foreign Service
                    spouses, as well as for resident Americans. So it's possible that this could
                    even help us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody mentioned that there may be problems with the
                        countries if you take away the Foreign Service National jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I don't think the suggestion by Rockefeller is that we remove all
                    Foreign Service Nationals, but that the jobs be competitive, and not restricted
                    to Foreign Service Nationals. Or that his position from what I've heard from his
                    staff members say, is not to bar Americans from jobs, from applying for
                    jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the case before? I thought they were always open
                        to Americans anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: No. Foreign Service Nationals positions in the embassy are identified
                    as Foreign Service Nationals. Now there has been a given mechanism whereby a
                    particular position, when it became available, when a Foreign Service National
                    left, to convert that to what is called FSN/AFM, Foreign Service
                    National/American Family Member. But that required a procedure, and it was only
                    done under certain circumstances. So you can kind of see how this would be a
                    very emotional issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. I remember another person pointed out
                        that ... well, look around in the Washington area at all the embassies ...
                        did you find Americans working in say in the Thai embassy, or Australian
                        embassy? And that is true overseas. American embassies hire certainly a lot
                        more Foreign Service Nationals than the embassies we see here in the United
                        States. So in that sense you have to think about the Americans
                        overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think the whole FSN program has been developed in order to have a
                    structure to the continuity that really is necessary in an overseas mission,
                    both in terms of language skills, in terms of [local customs]. I mean if you
                    have to have someone who is clearing your furniture through customs, I think you
                    want someone who knows how things work, who worked there and knows the local
                    regulations are. It's a very important part of managing an embassy mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maryann, let me ask you about your staff. I think we might
                        have mentioned last time that you now have a male spouse on the staff for
                        the first time. And everybody is very excited about it, and perhaps you can
                        describe those people that you have on the staff, and tell us a little bit
                        more about the Foreign Service profile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, the FLO staff is from the [FS community]. I think of the Foreign
                    Service community in its broadest [sense]. That is people who are on the staff
                    all have had overseas experience. They all have lived and worked in embassies
                    overseas, and they come from different agencies. We have people who have been
                    associated with AID, with USIA, the military, Foreign Commercial Service, U.S.
                    Information Service, as well as State. But that kind of cross-section of the
                    overseas community really does bring another dimension to diversity, which I
                    think is important. What we haven't had, while we were established in 1978, is a
                    gender diversity. That again has not been by design. Our job competition is very
                    keen, and we were pleased at this time that the best candidate, and the one
                    selected, was a young man who had had experience in American overseas schools
                    and recently had come from Africa. He was working at the embassy, and his wife
                    was a Foreign Service officer. So I think in a sense what we have in here is
                    (voice on tape too faint to transcribe) ... how to manage that is strictly in
                    the personnel area. The issues we would deal with though in the tandem couple is
                    the tandem couple with children, the need for child care. Those people are going
                    to arrive at post, and start working immediately. The impact of a crisis on a
                    tandem couple, and that's an important one that we always track. If the husband
                    and wife are both officers, say one is a communicator and the other is a consul,
                    and there is a crisis at the post, dependents have to be evacuated, and the
                    spouses and children, but both officers are necessary. Then what happens to the
                    child? That's one of the things that tandem couples think about, work through.
                    So it's that kind of thing that impact on a family and their quality of life
                    that we are interested in, and pay attention to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were just talking about the future of the Foreign
                        Service, and you mentioned a number of people that you'd like to recognize.
                        I have one question about that actually, what has been the toughest thing
                        for you as the director of this office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Personally, the tough things, the challenges are always the most
                    exciting and I really am very up for those. I don't like monotony, and I don't
                    like the status quo. When I feel that I'm just sort of maintaining things, I
                    find that not too interesting. I tell you one thing, when you try to keep your
                    budget so that you can keep some programs intact, that's been a tough thing. And
                    there have been times in the past, as you know, you hear about this all over the
                    Department, budget crunch and the possibility of loss of programs. At first the
                    loss of the CLO program overseas, or the wholesale reduction in the CLO program,
                    that would be a real disaster, I think. We had to do a little amount of
                    negotiating behind the scenes in selling our programs so that we maintained
                    those services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the number one issue for the new director
                        coming in? It's several months away, but ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: The new director is going to have to find out ... make his or her own
                    way, and I'm sure that one of the things that a new director will want to do is
                    to look around and see where we are now, and come up with an exciting bold
                    agenda. And I know it will be a person who will do just that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... a lot of good people before us so ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I should probably though point out that I think the issues such as the
                    employment of family members continue to be really at the top of the list of
                    things that we're paying attention to, and ensuring that we move ahead on
                    institutionalizing some of the changes. The AFMA program, American Family Member
                    Associates program, which we want to open up again to applicants. Once we open
                    it, we won't want to keep it open. We want to move into phase two whereby we
                    hope there will be positions identified that family members will move into. So
                    that we really structure that kind of opportunity. So those are the things that
                    I think we are moving toward, and I would expect that they aren't done on what
                    remains on my watch, a new director will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's almost like really inevitable if you're going to
                        ensure good quality of the Foreign Service officers, those that want to come
                        in, they're not going to come if their family are not going to be taken care
                        of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: That's right, and I think this is the reality of today's world. We
                    have people who are capable, who need to have maximum opportunity, and I want to
                    see our skill's [data bank] doubled. Oh, we've started a new campaign, just
                    beginning right now. We're cabling all the CLOs and asking to help us. We want
                    to double the participation in our data bank, our skills bank. We now have 3,000
                    people, we want to have at least 6,000.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Well, for various reasons. One, in order to be able to assist people
                    with jobs, we need to know who they are. Because the better our skills bank is,
                    the better we can work with an embassy overseas on what their needs are. The
                    better we can respond to an American in international business for what their
                    needs are, so we want to double that, and then we want to double the number
                    ofwhat we do for American international business. So those are some goals that I
                    hope we can accomplish in the very near future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Maryann, I want to end with a more personal side of
                        your Foreign Service contribution. I notice on your bio that you were
                        involved in a lot of theater groups, that seemed to have jumped out at me.
                        I'd like you to tell me a little bit more about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: It's interesting that you noted that. When I was writing all that
                    stuff for the bio, going back to not only jobs but other things that we did, I
                    noticed it also. We have had more fun with community theater from our very first
                    post. At the very first post, Guatemala in 1967. I was interested in the theater
                    when I was in college. My husband had the musical skills, he played the guitar,
                    he sang, but we hadn't done any of this kind of community theater stuff. When we
                    went to our First post and went to one of the plays that was put on, “Oh, this
                    really looks like fun.” And then someone from the theater group said, “Would you
                    like to help?” And I said, “Yes, I really would.” But this is what I tell people
                    when people come in, say yes, and try something. So I think the first time in
                    Guatemala I sold ads for the program, but then we took part in the theater
                    group, and before you knew it I was trying out For plays. One of the high points
                    of that period, I guess, performing in A Midsummer Night's Dream in the National
                    Theater in Guatemala, which was an amphitheater, an outdoor amphitheater, and it
                    was a major big production, and I was Puk. That's a long time ago, but it was
                    real fun.</p>
                <p>Then we moved on to another post, and started a theater group there, my husband
                    directed, we painted slats and built them in our back yard, and we got people to
                    come over and help with that. It was really a community project, something for
                    everyone. The person who didn't want to act, didn't want to do anything in front
                    of the public, but was great at carpentry. We had a lot of fun doing that.</p>
                <p>And then we went on, and one of the plays we actually presented I think in three
                    different countries, Barefoot in the Park. It was a movie, it was a Neil Simon
                    stage play. We did it in one country and then we were transferred and we said,
                    we know how to do this, let's get a group together.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I think ultimately we presented that three times in three different countries. I
                    think most Foreign Service people have a couple of things that they've just had
                    a wonderful time doing. Some people it's trekking, or collecting things. For us
                    it has been theater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me of a comment somebody said in Alaska, I
                        think it was some guy who wanted to be a disk jockey and was never able to
                        do it, but there in Alaska nobody else would, and there he was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: I think the best advice, if anyone asks, and people have when I talk
                    to them, particularly to new officer groups, “Look, go out and have a good time.
                    This is a chance for you to try some things that you wouldn't have time to try
                    if you were living and working in Washington all your life.” And the other thing
                    is that the communities really need it. We need each other, so you can have an
                    awfully good time doing this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's also probably activities like that that break down
                        the barriers between officers, and spouses, and other dependents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: Yes. I remember in Guatemala ... again, this is our first post, and
                    the newest kids on the block, and I remember working behind the scenes on one of
                    the plays, and there was the DCM who was in Our Town, and at that time I thought
                    the DCM was really way up there, but here he was coming to rehearsals like
                    everyone else, and having a good time. And you're right, it's a great
                    leveler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very, very interesting. Did you in your personal
                        experience ever encounter the difficulties dealing with officers because you
                        were a spouse when you were at various posts ... not being treated
                        nicely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MINUTILLO: No, I can't say that I did really. I didn't have any of that kind of
                    problem. Nor did I really have situations in which I felt like I was being told
                    that I had to do things. I liked all of our overseas experiences. But I always
                    did a lot of things in the community. Besides theater I think of the other high
                    points for me was working on a literacy program with a local group in Latin
                    America, literacy in Spanish. So I joined that group and I became trained in how
                    to teach reading and writing to adults who were working in the psychiatric
                    hospitals. So it was a very difficult environment, but I felt it was a
                    contribution. I think those are the kinds of things that become significant. I
                    just hope people continue to do what they want to do, enjoy it, and do a little
                    giving at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what it sounds like. Just get up and do
                        something.</hi>
