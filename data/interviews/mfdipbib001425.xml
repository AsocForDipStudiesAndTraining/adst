                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To start with, tell us about where and when you were born
                        and something about your childhood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I have always said that I am a product of the Middle West. My whole
                    family is from Nebraska and both my parents were born in the same little town,
                    West Point, in the eastern part of the state. I was born in Omaha in 1934 and we
                    moved shortly afterwards to Lincoln. My father had just been hired by the
                    Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, which makes basketball, football, and baseball
                    equipment, as a salesman. When he was promoted and given a new territory, we
                    moved to Columbus, Ohio where we lived from 1939 to 1943.</p>
                <p>My mother was a math and chemistry major at the University of Nebraska and became
                    a high school teacher of both subjects. When she married she, of course, had to
                    quit, which was the norm in those days. During WWII, she was recalled when all
                    the male math and chemistry teachers were drafted.</p>
                <p>Before joining Rawlings, my father had been a high school coach and American
                    history teacher. He also graduated from the University of Nebraska, where he had
                    been a star athlete. My father's family had migrated to Nebraska right after the
                    Civil War from Pennsylvania; they were Pennsylvania Dutch. My mother's family
                    was German from Prussia, and had immigrated after Bismarck expanded conscription
                    in 1870. Many of that family stayed in Wisconsin; others went further west to
                    Nebraska. My maiden name is Elliott, which came from Scotch-Irish ancestors who
                    came through the port of Philadelphia in the early 1800s, as many leaving Ulster
                    did. That first Elliott forefather married into a Pennsylvania Dutch family,
                    which had immigrated probably in the mid-18th Century and had fought in the
                    Revolutionary War. The fact that this surname has two Ls and two Ts indicated
                    that the family had come from the Scottish lowlands, and probably then on to
                    Northern Ireland, and not from England.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I had one brother, who was four years older. He was very much like my mother's
                    family and interested in machines, so he went to Purdue and became an engineer.
                    My father's family had always been interested in politics and in public affairs.
                    My grandfather Elliott was for a while the county attorney of Cumming County,
                    where West Point, the little town both my parents were from, is located; he came
                    West after the Civil War to teach school. He had graduated I think from a small
                    Pennsylvania college or maybe the University Of Pennsylvania and had studied law
                    with an older relative to become an attorney. One year, he ran for Congress as a
                    Republican, but lost, probably in a William Jennings Bryan landslide. This small
                    town, West Point, has always reminded me very much of River City o“Music Man”
                    fame. It had two or three thousand inhabitants principally from three ethnic
                    groups: the Scandinavians, the Germans and the Bohemians. The town was split in
                    two by religion: the Protestants (Scandinavians and the northern Germans) and
                    the Catholics (southern Germans and the Bohemians). My family was all
                    Protestant.</p>
                <p>There are wonderful stories about the little town of West Point. My grandfather
                    did not have a great many educated friends. He and the Catholic priest were
                    probably the two most educated men in town and in the evening they liked to sit
                    on the front porch to discuss affairs of the world. The fact that a Protestant
                    and Catholic seemed to have such good rapport raised some concern in the town!
                    They were told not to continue!</p>
                <p>In the late 1990s, Bob and I were invited to Katherine Graham's 80th birthday
                    party. We had been friends for many years in Washington. Warren Buffet, who was
                    a major investor in Graham's Washington Post, was also at the party. He had
                    helped the Grahams with financial and business advice, as Katherine Graham noted
                    in her autobiography. I was anxious to meet Buffet again because his mother and
                    mine had grown up across the street from each other in West Point. His sister
                    had been in college at the same time I was, so our two families have had some
                    connections over the years. During the party, Buffet and I conversed about our
                    old houses and families. He told me that his grandfather was the publisher and
                    editor of the West Point Democrat - I told him that my grandfather had been the
                    editor and publisher of the West Point Republican. We all roared with laughter
                    and wondered about flapping wings overhead!</p>
                <p>Back to the main narrative - by the end of 1942, all athletic equipment
                    manufactured in the United States was commandeered for the armed forces and that
                    made salesmen surplus. Athletic teams of whatever sort had to make do with what
                    they haMy father was moved into the home office of Rawlings, St. Louis,
                    Missouri, and we moved there in the summer of 1943. During the war, it was
                    difficult to find houses but my parents found one in a small suburb called
                    Brentwood, which was where I grew up</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about your home life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: My parents were always very active in community affairs. My father knew
                    something about education and did not feel that the schools in Brentwood were
                    very good. So he ran for the school board, served many years, and eventually was
                    elected president. He handed me my high school diploma! He was also very active
                    in the Congregational church; he sang in the choir, and was on the Board of
                    Elders. He also belonged to a variety of boards around St. Louis.</p>
                <p>My mother was the president of the PTA, as well as president of the women's
                    church organization. So I grew up in a family that was very involved in its
                    community. My grandmother Elliott, wife of the editor of the West Point
                    Republican, had become a widow in middle age with children to get through
                    college. Through her Republican connections, she was appointePostmistress of
                    West Point, which helped her to finance the college educations of her four sons,
                    though not her two daughters. She was very active in Nebraska's Republican Party
                    and I think at one time she had done some work for Harold Stassen. So my brother
                    and I grew up in an atmosphere which was very positive about involvement in
                    politics at the local and national levels.</p>
                <p>I was always fascinated by history and public affairs; at the movies, where we
                    all went a lot, I loved Time Marches On and other newsreels. Our close neighbors
                    pointed out to me one day that the United States had a diplomatic service; I
                    said that I didn't know anything about it. The neighbor contacted her
                    brother-in-law who was a Congressman from southern Missouri and asked his office
                    to have some material on the State Department sent to me. This was about 1946 or
                    1947 when I was about twelve. I can remember lying on my shag bedroom rug,
                    reading through the sample Foreign Service test that had arrived. I also read
                    about what the life of a diplomat might be. I was impressed by how tough and
                    comprehensive the exam seemed to be and I could not imagine I could never pass
                    it. At the same time, I was attracted by all the interesting aspects of a
                    diplomatic career and decided that I would not forget the Foreign Service as a
                    possible future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very interesting and I think probably a rare
                        exception particularly for people in the Middle West. Let me go back to
                        1934. Did the New Deal have any effect on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: In Nebraska, we were all staunch Republicans. Common expressions included
                    “That man in the White House,” meaning FDR. Every time we drove over an overpass
                    on the way to Omaha, my family would curse and grumble about the CCC (the
                    Civilian Conservation Corps), “What a waste of money!” The tracks below were
                    used by one train per day and that, of course, made the project very expensive.
                    When Eisenhower was elected, my mother dashed up the stairs exclaiming that I
                    had never lived under a Republican president!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you absorb the Republican family atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Probably so, particularly the fiscal conservative aspect. My family saw
                    many farms and businesses go under but they themselves were only moderately hit
                    by the Depression; they survived, and remained skeptical of government
                    expenditures. The motto was “Eat it up, make it over, and do without” or
                    something like that. The message was that human beings were to use everything
                    they had and not waste or hoard anything. Excesses were frowned upon. Of course,
                    I was a child during WWII when not much was available; we had shoe rationing and
                    had to make do with one or two pair; if one were really fortunate, one had boots
                    also.</p>
                <p>With the Depression and during the war, people did not own a lot of extras. All
                    lived fairly Spartan lives by today's standards, but no one seemed to mind and
                    life went on. For the sporting goods business, there was huge pent-up demand
                    that had to be restrained until after the war. But once the restrictions were
                    lifted, business just took off with major sales to teams, groups, and
                    individuals. Customers became very competitive; they would stand in long lines
                    to buy team uniforms and equipment. It was then that I first began to see
                    corporate gifts and some hints of luxury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that for many of us, WWII was the greatest
                        geography lesson that we could have. Did you also learn a lot about the
                        world during those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes indeed. I was very interested in geography in any case. My family
                    used to follow the battles; I can remember sitting with my grandmother as the
                    Allies approached Berlin. She would say, “Oh, yes, Aunt Augusta came from that
                    little town and Uncle Wilhelm had relatives in that town!” We always had atlases
                    and books with maps, so following WWII events was not unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? Do you remember any books that
                        particularly fascinated you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We did a great deal of reading. We always had books - many from the
                    library. In those days, we used to make weekly trips to the public library and
                    the school library. So we always had books around, although very few belonged to
                    the family.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I do remember some of the first few “grown-up” books I read. There was one called
                    Van Loon's Lives by Henry Klemner. It had a red cover. It was quite thick. It
                    was an entertaining story in which the main character was allowed to invite
                    famous people from years gone by for dinner. They would then discuss various
                    aspects of life, literature, and culture of their time. Van Loon would then go
                    through the menu that he had prepared as well as some musical selections as
                    background. The menu and the music were a bit beyond me, a mere girl of 13 or
                    14, but I do remember some of the biographies in those stories because they held
                    great fascination for me. The lead character would write the name of a famous
                    person on a slip of paper and somehow that person would appear. On one piece of
                    paper, he wrote “The Greatest Inventor of all Times.” Who showed up was a cave
                    man; it was unclear what he had contributed - perhaps fire or the wheel or
                    something else.</p>
                <p>The fact is that in high school we read a great deal - such authors as Thornton
                    Wilder. We girls also read the Nancy Drew mysteries series; the boys read Thomas
                    Swift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your teachers in grade school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had some excellent teachers as well as some real duds. This was of
                    concern to my parents because of their interest in their children's education as
                    well as their interest in maintaining a high standard in the local educational
                    system in general. I can remember that my 6th grade teacher was a screwball.
                    Mother felt that we were not receiving sufficient education in English so she
                    home taught me on the side. Math was never too difficult for me - I guess that
                    came from my mother who as I said was a math teacher. I had a very good high
                    school math teacher as well as an excellent civics teacher and an average
                    English teacher. I had a good chemistry teacher. I still remember them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you participate in extracurricular activities in high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes indeed. I was involved in all sorts of activities. It was, as I said,
                    a very small school - my graduating high school class consisted of 55 students.
                    So we all knew each other well. I was involved in the debating club, in the
                    drama club as well as sports. I also had joined the Girl Scouts and went to camp
                    in the summer - the typical “all-American girl” of the 1940s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of emphasis on the old shibboleth that “a
                        woman's place was in the home?”</hi>
                </p>

                <p>OAKLEY: The prevalent atmosphere certainly did emphasize that women were to
                    marry, have children, and become home-makers. On the other hand, I was always a
                    very good student; I was at the top of my class in all subjects. I had lots of
                    ambition and capabilities which were encouraged. My father and mother wanted me
                    to learn short-hand; I said I would learn typing because that would be useful in
                    whatever future I might have, but I would not take short-hand. I was not going
                    to be a secretary! I can remember some of the early conversations with my
                    parents when they tried to suggest that I could become an executive secretary if
                    I learned short-hand. They insisted that an executive secretary had a lot of
                    power in an organization; my response was always that I wanted to be the
                    executive - not the secretary. There was never any doubt in my mind that I
                    wanted to break out of the accepted mold. Instinctively, I think I had
                    considerable support from my mother and my father - particularly the latter. He
                    got a kick out of so many of my efforts and accomplishments. I think they
                    realized that I had potential to go beyond the “secretarial level” and therefore
                    they decided to encourage me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any role models?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Unfortunately, I don't think I had any. There were lots of men involved
                    in public affairs. I don't think that I ever had any doubt that I could
                    participate in that life as well. People in Nebraska admired Eleanor Roosevelt,
                    even if they disagreed with her. My mother had been a Phi Beta Kappa, had taught
                    mathematics and so in some respects had broken out of the mold. She did not
                    believe that there were any mental limitations on women.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school in 1952. What happened
                        next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: My parents said that I could go to any university in the U.S. I wished to
                    - except Vassar. In the late 1930s my father had gone to a football game at the
                    University of Pittsburgh when it had a good football team. He had been sitting
                    in the stands, having a wonderful time, cheering madly. He sat next to a woman
                    who didn't do anything. My father with his engaging personality turned to the
                    woman and said, “Why aren't you cheering?” She replied, “I am from Vassar and I
                    am beyond that!” That was just too much for my father; he never forgot and told
                    me that I could go anywhere but Vassar. He later told me he realized immediately
                    after saying that I couldn't go to Vassar that I would probably put that college
                    at the top of my list! I debated whether to attend an all-girls school in the
                    East or a large diversified university elsewhere. I finally decided that I
                    wanted to attend a large coed school in the Midwest. I chose that because I had
                    been in a small high school; I really wanted to test my wings in a larger
                    school. I was also wild about boys and I thought I would be happier in a coed
                    school. I chose not to leave the general Midwest area since that was all I knew,
                    and I thought I would be more comfortable staying in a part of the country I
                    knew.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I applied to Northwestern only and was accepted. I have sometimes wondered
                    whether I would not have had a better education, in the broadest sense, had I
                    gone to a school such as Radcliff or Smith or Stanford. I think now it would not
                    have been right for me at the time. I must add that I got a wonderful education
                    at Northwestern; I got a lot out of the school and in retrospect I think it was
                    a very fortuitous choice.</p>
                <p>At Northwestern, I plunged into all the typical coed activities. I knew I wanted
                    to major in political science and never changed, and therefore was in the
                    College of Arts and Sciences. I had a glorious four years - was elected to Phi
                    Beta Kappa and was very active in student politics. In those days, a woman could
                    not be elected president of the student council; that was a male bastion. But I
                    did become the vice-president. I belonged to a number of honorary clubs and was
                    very active in many campus activities. I joined a sorority; at one point I was
                    even “pinned” to a football player. I had a wide circle of acquaintances. Many
                    of the professors were “top-notch,” and I took a lot of history courses. One of
                    my favorites was “American Diplomatic History” taught by Richard Leopold who,
                    together with Arthur Link, were pivotal members of the history faculty. Link
                    later went to Princeton to work on a biography of Woodrow Wilson. Leopold took a
                    liking to me; I was wild about him and he was extremely helpful. He has been an
                    advisor to some of the committees on which I currently sit at Northwestern. He
                    is still alive and we still correspond. At some point in the last four years, I
                    was very flattered to be asked to make some remarks about Professor Leopold and
                    foreign policy at a dinner honoring him. In his classes, Leopold used to quote
                    Dr. Dooley - a hypothetical character at the time of the Spanish American War.
                    It was great fun to search for some of those quotations and use them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Cold War and/or the communist internal threat
                        (McCarthy) intrude at all in your classes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It did because of the courses I was taking. I had an introductory course
                    in my freshman year that was a combination of economics, politics, and political
                    science and philosophy. The teacher, who was a terrific fellow, told us to tell
                    our parents that we were not being taught communism; he was teaching about
                    communism. As you said, this was the McCarthy period - or its immediate
                    aftermath. That was very troubling to us and people on campus were very aware of
                    the situation. In my family, everyone felt that McCarthy was a disaster and a
                    demagogue, but there was some apprehension that he might have found some kernels
                    of truth. My family was not fond of Harry Truman. I think that he did not have a
                    very good reputation in Missouri in those days. My family felt that he was a
                    mere “machine” politician; he was not very well educated and did not have the
                    background necessary to be president. History proved them wrong, but at the time
                    I think my family's views were typical of many people in Missouri.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Hans Morgenthau came to Northwestern as a visiting professor in the spring of my
                    sophomore year. Everyone was very excited about taking his course and it had a
                    profound impact on me, because what he was preaching was “national interest.” He
                    thought that Soviet expansionism was the real threat, not communism in general.
                    I think undoubtedly the fear of communism and socialism did increase in the U.S.
                    in the 1950s. So the issue was very much on our minds. We were well aware of the
                    “Iron Curtain” and of the competition between the two major blocks - the
                    capitalist West and the communist East. I must say that it was only when I got
                    to Fletcher, with the invasion of Hungary, for example, that I really began to
                    focus on East-West tensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, either on campus or home, notice any residue of
                        isolationism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think there was some revival of that view in the late 1940s as
                    promulgated by The Chicago Tribune and others as the U.S. began to enter into
                    the Cold War. There certainly was some isolationist sentiment, but it was not
                    prevalent enough to challenge the view that for our basic national interests we
                    had to compete with the Soviets. I certainly did not feel that isolationism was
                    a major factor. Frankly, the professors that taught the courses I took strongly
                    supported U.S. involvement in world affairs and the assumption of world
                    leadership by the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any noticeable radicalism on campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: If there was blatant racism, I was not aware of it. What we had at
                    Northwestern was the beginning of the hippie and Bohemian movements. We had a
                    theater and speech school that attracted many who came to learn how to “emote.”
                    I am happy to say that Warren Beatty waited on tables at a near-by sorority
                    house. He was a theater major; he was an attractive fellow, but not the
                    heart-stopper that he later became. There were many others like that who
                    attended the theater school and tended to congregate together drinking coffee
                    all day while discussing the “higher things of life.” They were not very
                    interested in campus politics and other prosaic concerns.</p>
                <p>I do remember the campus reaction to Brown vs. the Board of Education - the 1954
                    Supreme Court decision abolishing segregation in public schools. We were all
                    fully supportive of that decision. I would describe myself as being more than
                    moderately progressive; I had been that from the beginning since I would
                    describe my family in the same terms. I certainly never felt any pressure to
                    challenge that court finding and in fact all my friends applauded it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the racial composition of Northwestern when you

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: There were a few black girls in our freshman dorm. It was just the
                    beginning of efforts to bring black students to Northwestern. They roomed
                    together and we all thought we were liberal! In spite of Chicago's large black
                    community, their attendance at Northwestern was not in the numbers one might
                    have expected. We did have a number of black athletes, but very few black girls
                    that I knew. That was also true for Asians; there were not many of them at the
                    university. There were not many Hispanics. Because of the proximity to Chicago,
                    Northwestern had a larger contingent of Jewish students. I had never really
                    known many, but several Jewish students became my very dearest friends and are
                    still so today.</p>
                <p>I was an appointed member of the Committee on Undergraduate Life, basically a
                    faculty/ administration committee on undergraduates. We faced the issue of
                    whether a student's application for admittance to a sorority or fraternity
                    should include a question on religious affiliation. The inclusion of such
                    information would of course allow the sorority or fraternity to practice
                    discrimination if it wished. The other side of the argument was that if the
                    information were not included, those fraternities or sororities which admitted
                    only Jewish students would not be able to spot their prospective members. This
                    was a burning question. Today, of course, there is no argument; the information
                    is not available and no one really cares. I think there are still some Jewish
                    fraternities and sororities today, but Jewish students are admitted to other
                    fraternities and sororities. Many today don't even want to bother with that sort
                    of thing and many prefer residential colleges to the “Greek system.”</p>
                <p>I also took a lot of modern European history, economics, mathematics, geography
                    and French. I was never particularly interested in the sciences. All in all, I
                    had a wonderful four years. During the summers, several times I was employed as
                    a camp counselor. After my junior year, four of my counselor colleagues and I
                    organized a trip to Europe. That would have been in the summer of 1955. We did
                    it through the Scandinavian Student Travel Service; we sailed on a converted
                    troop transport that took twelve days to get to Europe. Then we traveled all
                    over the Continent for two months for less than $1,500. It was terrific. After
                    that introduction, I certainly felt a greater interest in international
                    relations and that my potential choice of a career in the Foreign Service was
                    the right one.</p>
                <p>In my senior year, I had to face what I would do the following year and I applied
                    for fellowships and scholarships in the fall. I had very good grades (all As my
                    Junior year) and election to Phi Beta Kappa, plus honors in Political Science
                    and Cum Laude. Unlike students today, I felt I shouldn't bother my professors
                    with the burdens of recommendations; there was a much greater distance between
                    students and professors in the 1950s than there is today. What I didn't know
                    until later was that my professors were looking out for me and my advisor, when
                    I finally did go to him, was very helpful; he led me to the Fletcher School
                    which he thought would be a perfect fit. He also found a fellowship for which I
                    was eligible and proceeded to recommend me for it. It all worked out well.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>In November 1955, I turned twenty-one, which was the minimum age to take the
                    Foreign Service exam and it was to be given in Chicago in early December. I
                    remember meeting my father in Chicago earlier in the fall where he was attending
                    a big sales meeting; we were walking down a street on the way to dinner when I
                    said to him that I wasn't sure whether I should take the Foreign Service exam. I
                    didn't think I could pass it and in any case, I wanted to go to the Fletcher
                    School for at least a year so that even if I passed, I could not go on to the
                    Foreign Service right away. He asked whether it would be a strike against me if
                    I didn't pass and make it more difficult later on. I said that it would not and
                    that an applicant could take the exam as often as he or she wanted. So he
                    suggested that I go ahead and take the exam, just for the experience if nothing
                    else.</p>
                <p>So I did take the exam in early December, in downtown Chicago in a gigantic room
                    in a federal building. The room was absolutely filled with applicants with only
                    a few women in the crowd. We all sat down and given the number of applicants and
                    my circumstances, I did not feel much pressure. I was used to taking tests and I
                    approached this one as just another exam. Lo and behold, I passed! When I took
                    the oral part of the exam in the spring of 1956, I passed that as well. But as I
                    said, by this time I had been accepted at Fletcher and had a very nice
                    fellowship.</p>
                <p>The chairman of the oral panel was Herbert Fales. (I was asked in later life if I
                    had not been intimidated to appear before a board of examiners headed by a man
                    named “fails.”) People had told me that the best way to prepare for the orals
                    was to read the Sunday edition of The New York Times. I did that. The discussion
                    at one stage focused on statistics - the GNP of various countries, populations,
                    that sort of thing. I was asked whether I knew the GNP of the U.S. and I gave
                    them a figure that was not even close. In trying to cover my mistake, I told the
                    panel that one is always told to say the first thing that comes to mind because
                    generally first thoughts are correct. I then told the panel that that theory
                    just had been proven wrong! Everybody laughed and we went on to the next
                    subject. I enjoyed the session.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, when I was informed that I had passed, Mr. Fales gave me a note
                    saying that his niece was going to attend Fletcher at the same time I would be
                    there. He thought I would enjoy meeting her and attached his card as an
                    introduction. Of course, I met her right away. She became a dear friend. Her
                    name was Priscilla Mitchell Boughton; she joined AID after graduating from
                    Fletcher. Her sister is Alice Rivlin, the well known economist. Priscilla died a
                    few years ago, but we had a great friendship that started with that oral
                    examination.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: Of course. There was always that undercurrent and a knowing smile would
                    often by followed by the phrase “two for the price of one.” I began to hate that
                    expression. It was insulting. I didn't hear that expression as much at Fletcher
                    as I did when I came to Washington at the end of August, 1957, during my A-100
                    class at the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about the student body at Fletcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There had been, of course, a few foreign students at Northwestern. One of
                    the organizations I belonged to was devoted to making sure that all of these
                    students were able to spend some time every week at a sorority or fraternity
                    house. I became acquainted with a German girl and took her home during a
                    Thanksgiving holiday. I don't know whatever happened to her, but we did our best
                    at Northwestern to try to integrate these foreign students into American
                    life.</p>
                <p>At Fletcher, it was a different story. About half of the student body was from
                    abroad. We had a large contingent from Pakistan, and students from Germany,
                    Japan, India, and so forth. I have maintained contacts with a large number of
                    these people. Many of them, of course, have risen in the ranks of their
                    governments and societies. One for example became the Thai ambassador to the
                    U.S.; one became the UN coordinator in Bosnia and Cambodia; many of the
                    Pakistanis ended up in their diplomatic service. For me, these have been
                    wonderful associations. At Fletcher, we were very close; it was such a small
                    student body. To be sure, we did have heated debates about such events as the
                    Suez invasion or the Soviet invasion of Hungary in the fall of 1956; we lived
                    and breathed foreign policy. At Fletcher, there were no extracurricular
                    activities; all we did was go to class and study and debate with friends, with
                    some bridge mixed in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Hungarian issue play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was clearly a view that the Soviets were the aggressors holding
                    back democratic aspirations of the Hungarian people by force, but there was no
                    demand among the students that the U.S. or NATO take action to drive the Soviets
                    out. That possibility was beyond conception at that time. The Hungarian
                    revolution solidified opposition to the Soviet Union. Many countries which might
                    have had been critical of Soviet policy were quite muted in their comments and
                    it was a very difficult issue. I also remember debates with students from the
                    Third World who resented the U.S. for “throwing its weight around” particularly
                    when it came to the use of assistance funds. There was considerable sentiment
                    for just giving our money to a country that would spend it in ways its
                    government considered best for it. There were also students who did not care for
                    their governments; they wondered why we supported those governments with
                    assistance at all; their preferred process was to just send money directly to
                    the populations who would use it for their own benefit. It was a classic debate,
                    repeated throughout the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this issue addressed in your classes at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Our classes were much too theoretical to tackle such specific issues.
                    Also, I attended Fletcher for only one year - at the time, that was all that was
                    needed for a Master's Degree. I have looked at course catalogues of comparable
                    graduate schools today and notice that most institutions have moved away from
                    just basic requirements. For the one year program then, a student had to take
                    one course each in economics, international law, diplomatic history (which as I
                    have mentioned I had taken at Northwestern, but then was required to participate
                    in an advanced seminar at Fletcher), and some course on development. But all of
                    the courses were very theoretical. I think study in those days was geared much
                    more to a core curriculum that a student had to take. Today, courses are given
                    on a variety of development issues - and on specific issues in regional
                    relations, such as Sino/U.S. relations, and human rights. A student today has a
                    wide variety of choices, but on the other hand, that student may not have a
                    general framework in which the specific issue might fit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any discussions about Israel and
                        Palestine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was not much focus on that issue as I remember it. This was
                    1956/1957, very early in the development of the Arab-Israeli issue. Israel was
                    struggling; it was not the powerhouse that it became. Suez was the closest we
                    came to the issue and that was more about colonialism than it was about Israel
                    and its Arab neighbors. The U.S. stance on the British and French invasion of
                    Suez gave us a real boost in the Third World.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the presence of Pakistani students. Were
                        there other foreign students who brought their political struggles to
                        Fletcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not really. We all got along reasonably well. The partition of India, I
                    have always felt, did not have a great impact on the United States. Most
                    Americans have no knowledge of what happened. In 1947, we were recovering from
                    WWII and viewed India as a British problem - that attitude changed later. I
                    think the Cold War was really the dominant international issue in the 1950s.
                    Then came the issues of socialism and planned economies followed by questions of
                    development - and what was the best approach to development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about independence for African colonies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We were all very supportive of independence movements. There was a
                    student from Ghana who was very excited about the move toward independence. If I
                    remember correctly, in the spring of 1956 Great Britain granted Ghana a new
                    constitution that eventually led to full-fledged independence in 1957. I think
                    there was a general feeling at Fletcher that independence would come to all of
                    the African colonies, the sooner the better, and this would lead to accelerated
                    economic development. Looking back, I would say we were rather na�ve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue of Fabian socialism as practiced in the
                        Third World discussed particularly since it seemed to be such a
                        disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think in 1957 we were just beginning to approach this issue. It was a
                    time in which most of the post-war governments in Europe had a socialist bent.
                    There was a great emphasis on central planning and direction. It was assumed
                    that most of the African countries would follow that pattern. India was a
                    perfect illustration; its approach to development reached its peak of fame in
                    the early 1960s when John Kenneth Galbraith became U.S. Ambassador to India. In
                    retrospect, I don't remember the socialist approach to development being
                    challenged by most American students, many of whom came out of a liberal
                    background. No one suggested that planned economies would not work and that the
                    road to development required free markets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There also seems to have been, and may continue to be, an
                        affinity in the academic world for planned economies. They are a lot easier
                        to study and develop theories from them! Capitalism is sort of chaotic and
                        does not lend itself to linear explanations. There did seem to be a leftish
                        bent on campuses.</hi>

                <p>OAKLEY: Charles Kindleberger of MIT was a visiting professor at Fletcher during
                    the year I was there. Even though I didn't take a course from him, I heard him
                    speak several times as he was a wonderful speaker. He was one of the best known
                    academics who thought that economies could be planned and thereby influence and
                    speed up development in various countries. That was a perfectly acceptable
                    notion in academic circles in the late 1950s. No one seemed to raise any
                    objections to this theory. It was only later that the debate really cam into
                    play.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: I remember casting my first presidential vote, an absentee ballot in the
                    fall of 1956. Most of my friends, as was I, were strongly influenced by their
                    families, admired Adlai Stevenson, but preferred Ike.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you graduated from Fletcher, how did you view your
                        future in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I have addressed classes at Fletcher on this subject many years after I
                    began in the Foreign Service. I have said that the vast majority of my
                    classmates expected to go into the public sector in some way. Most of the
                    Americans were thinking about careers in the Foreign Service although some
                    thought they would try it for three or four years and then see. Many of the
                    foreign students were expecting to enter their foreign offices and their foreign
                    services; a few of my colleagues were looking to work in the international
                    economic sphere, at Treasury or the Commerce Department. There were a number of
                    students who were considering careers in academia. Some stayed at Fletcher to
                    acquire their Ph.D.s, which would allow them to pursue teaching positions in
                    universities or colleges. Most of my male classmates had been in military
                    service; military service gave them an interest in foreign affairs and they
                    pursued that interest by going to Fletcher.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>A few of my male classmates did have to go into the military after graduating
                    from Fletcher. Some went on to law school. One or two went into private
                    business, but they were exceptions. More eventually joined the private sector
                    after experience in the public sector. Today, in looking where the graduates of
                    the class of 1957 are, you would get a much broader spectrum of employment than
                    you saw in 1958. I think that we all felt that we had some sort of mission or
                    obligation to enter public service. It was what interested us. We were not
                    materialistic; no one talked about becoming rich. People just didn't show overt
                    interest in the acquisition of material wealth. We were not ostentatious about
                    cars or clothes or trips. The times, and certainly Fletcher, was much more
                    equalitarian than today. Today, many if not most of the graduates from Fletcher
                    or Georgetown are heading for international business, either as employees of
                    large manufacturing corporations or consulting groups like Arthur Anderson or
                    Deloitte and Touche or investment banks and institutions specializing in
                    international finance. Some are going into journalism, which I think is slightly
                    more popular than it was in my days at Fletcher. None of my classmates went into
                    journalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any interest in becoming a Congressional staffer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: None that I can remember. There were several people from Fletcher who
                    after their Ph.D.s did become Congressional fellows for a year. They would come
                    to Washington and spend a year learning how Congress operated; some would spend
                    six months in the House and six months in the Senate. Seth Tillman was one of
                    those; he stayed after the end of his fellowship and eventually became chief
                    speech-writer for Senator Fulbright. Now he teaches at Georgetown. But the
                    internship route was not nearly as popular in the 1950s as it is today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you join the Foreign Service right after graduating
                        from Fletcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Upon graduation, I informed the Department that I was ready to enter on
                    duty. I was told by the Bureau of Personnel that they were very sorry but that
                    in that year the Department had already exceeded its quota for new officers and
                    didn't know when it could make me an offer. Deflation! So I went home from
                    Boston and found that period during which I had no idea what would happen to be
                    very difficult. I didn't know whether I would be offered a job by the Department
                    in six months or in a year or more. I didn't know what to do. I remember that
                    while taking a trip with my parents to visit my brother and his family, I
                    decided that upon returning home, if I had not heard from the Department, I was
                    just going to go out and get a job, almost any job. I just had to do something;
                    I just couldn't sit around just waiting. On my return home on a Sunday night, I
                    found a letter from the Department asking me to report to Washington, DC on
                    August 29, 1957. What a relief!</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>While waiting for that magic date, I took a trip to Mexico for the first time
                    with Priscilla Mitchell and her mother. We had a wonderful time and I returned
                    home for a few days before moving to Washington. I should add that my father did
                    not approve of this trip as I was so close to starting work in Washington and
                    had no money of my own. We worked it out that I would barrow the money, with
                    interest, which was fine with me. For Christmas that year he had a card printed
                    up saying “No Interest” in old English script - it gave us all much amusement
                    over the years!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Late summer is a great time to come to Washington!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: At the end of August I thought Washington rather a sleepy little town. I
                    had a friend from Fletcher who had gone to work for the CIA earlier in the
                    summer and had arranged with her to share an apartment when I arrived. She was
                    waiting for me in some dreadful women's hotel. We immediately rented an
                    efficiency apartment with twin beds in the Sherry Towers across from the
                    Department; it was a move of desperation just to get out of that hotel. Between
                    the two of us, she, who had graduated from Tufts and Fletcher, and I, from
                    Northwestern and Fletcher, we had a relatively large number of acquaintances in
                    Washington with a great deal of coming-in-and going-out of town - particularly
                    young military officers. Our hearts were young and gay. It was just wonderful.
                    Nothing complicated, but a steady stream of friends. We had very simple dinner
                    parties in the apartment and we had a great time.</p>
                <p>We then moved to a larger place in the Sherry Towers when Priscilla Mitchell came
                    to join us later in the fall. We didn't have our own cars so we had to find
                    boyfriends who would transport us around for shopping on Saturdays and who would
                    help us move. I was going through the A-100 course, where there were about
                    thirty of us, Foreign Service entrants. I was the only woman. But they did add
                    some other women later who had been working in the Department while waiting to
                    be assigned to the A-100 course. This meant that the composition of the group
                    was somewhat fluid.</p>
                <p>Another A-100 course that had started in July included a couple of other Fletcher
                    classmates. And thus, in September, I was introduced to Bob Oakley, although we
                    did not start dating until late October. I was involved at the time to a fellow
                    in Boston, complicating the situation as you can well imagine, but I broke off
                    with him. There were lots of informal parties, and friends in and out of our
                    apartment. It was great fun!</p>
                <p>I must add that I had a wonderful group in my A-100 class. It included Bill
                    Luers, David Korn, Peter Bridges, and Jim Briggs - all people who remained
                    wonderful Foreign Service colleagues through the years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any tidbits that gave you any clues as to
                        what you might want to do or what you did not wish to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think we all recognized at that point that we would have little choice
                    in first assignments. We didn't know what they would be and no one had any great
                    expectations. Even in those days, many officers spent their first tours in visa
                    sections in far off posts. There was no feeling that one could influence that
                    first assignment. There was just a higher authority that told you where to go
                    and off you went like a good soldier. I had not passed my French language
                    proficiency test yet, so I was held back from getting my first assignment until
                    I had completed French language training.</p>
                <p>Bob did not have an assignment either when he finished the A-100 course and some
                    French training just before Christmas. He was sent to study more French in Nice,
                    which at that time was the site of FSI's overseas French programs. Some heiress,
                    maybe Barbara Hutton, had donated a building. Later Congress closed it down -
                    they felt it was unseemly for the USG to have a program in a villa in Nice! And
                    right after that, in May of 1958, he was sent to Khartoum as the General
                    Services officer (where they spoke Arabic and English). By this time, we had
                    decided to get married and it was a very complicated situation. I knew that I
                    had to resign. I must say that at the time my consciousness was very low. Women
                    in the Foreign Service knew that if they married they would have to resign and
                    we accepted that discrimination without batting an eye lash. At the time, there
                    weren't many vacancies for junior officers; if the Department had offered me
                    something potentially interesting and challenging, I might have felt differently
                    about resignation. My decision to get married was undoubtedly greeted by
                    personnel with relief because it was just one less person whom it had to place.
                    I was told that the Department could not pay my way to the Sudan to get married,
                    but that it might be able to arrange a marriage by proxy. Dwight Dickinson was
                    the person in personnel trying to be helpful and take care of my problems. I
                    told him that I did not want to get married by proxy; I didn't think that it
                    really was the way to start a marriage. A number of people found my situation
                    quite amusing and used to laugh at my wedding plans; it confirmed their
                    prejudices about the Foreign Service accepting women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was pure discrimination, and the Department even today
                        still had troubles employing both husband and wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That is true, but the 1950s were totally different from today. In those
                    days, when women married, they generally did not work. I never asked to see the
                    regulations about married women; I did not object nor demand a job when I got to
                    Khartoum. I just accepted life as it was generally lived. In fact, the
                    Department operated by custom, and not because of legal limitations, but no
                    woman thought of challenging those customs - our consciousness was very low
                    indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read somewhere that until 1974, a middle grade male
                        officer could support a wife and a family. But that from that time on, a
                        family needed two incomes. So economics apparently had some impact in
                        changing customs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I am sure that played a role. As I said, in 1957-58, it never occurred to
                    me to challenge the Department on its personnel policies. I was deeply in love,
                    ready for marriage. I did not see myself as a victim in marrying Bob; it was the
                    beginning of a new phase in my life. I had had a feeling on a number of
                    occasions in college and at Fletcher, as I was taking one more test or filling
                    out one more application, that it might have been easier and time to give up and
                    just get married. That is what many women did. They didn't see any use in
                    pushing and fighting for certain positions when the outcome was quite evident
                    when one got married. I knew how they felt as I had had similar feelings at
                    moments of discouragement. But when I decided to marry Bob, I didn't feel that I
                    was doing it because other professional avenues were just too hard; I looked
                    forward to being a partner in a shared life in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was some validity to that view since when one
                        married in those days, one married into the Foreign Service. It was not just
                        getting married and living in some small American town. Both husband and
                        wife were going to be challenged when he was assigned overseas in the
                        Foreign Service. It was a different era. Let's talk a little about the role
                        of a wife in the Foreign Service. First what happened to you when you
                        decided to get married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I said, Bob was sent immediately from Nice to Khartoum about April. I
                    had found out first what was going to happen to him through a phone call from a
                    friend in the Foreign Service who had a contact in Personnel. I called Bob
                    immediately, not easy then, before he got his official orders and was told to be
                    in Khartoum in three days. It became very complicated to get home for a wedding
                    from the middle of Africa in June, 1958. Even with jet planes, it took two or
                    three days to get back to the States and Bob didn't have much leave. The embassy
                    was in desperate need for all hands because it was expanding with a new
                    assistance program and he was reluctant to tell his boss, after just arriving,
                    that he wanted to go back to the U.S. to get married with two weeks off. On the
                    other hand, if he had returned, we would have had to have a big wedding that
                    neither of us really wanted. We considered meeting in New York and being married
                    with the immediate family present. Both families had become acquainted and
                    friendly through an exchange of visits and everyone was very involved in all the
                    planning - and it seemed to become more complicated daily. (Our minister, at a
                    large party my parents gave just before I left, said not to worry about the
                    legality of the wedding - he would take care of that later!) In the end, it all
                    seemed too much and simply easier if I flew to Cairo alone to marry Bob. Bob was
                    to come up to Cairo a little earlier to make the arrangements - and for our
                    honeymoon which we hoped to take in Beirut. Unfortunately, the Marines landed in
                    Lebanon about this time but Cairo offered excitement enough for a
                    honeymoon..</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>There was still considerable anti-American feeling in Egypt in 1958. Some people
                    doubted that we could ever get married there. I ignored the skeptics and told
                    Bob that the thing I really wanted was that he meet me at the Cairo airport and
                    it would all work out. (Bob laughed when he heard that my father had bought just
                    a one way ticket to Cairo!) When I landed on the tarmac at the Cairo airport, in
                    the middle of the night, I could not find Bob. Finally, a stewardess came up
                    with a message that he was on his way to pick me up. What had happened was that
                    Bob had had to get a yellow fever shot to get into Egypt from the Sudan; when he
                    arrived in Cairo, the Egyptian officials objected to the where it was listed on
                    his health card. It was just a tweak at an American official! They put him in
                    quarantine at the airport. The Egyptian officials finally allowed him to make
                    one call to an American consul. He was obviously a jerk because his comment was
                    that there wasn't anything he could do and hung up. Finally Bob managed to
                    convince the authorities to allow him to make another phone call and he reached
                    an A-100 class friend at the embassy who had been very helpful in trying to
                    arrange our wedding. He came out to the airport and paid off an official to
                    stamp the health document that allowed Bob to leave quarantine. That should have
                    been done in the beginning!</p>
                <p>So Bob got out of quarantine just a couple of ours before I was to land. He went
                    back to Cairo to change clothes - he was covered with bed bug bites by this time
                    - but that made him late for his return to the airport. Finally he and our
                    friends arrived just as I was getting to the waiting area - and was I glad to
                    see them!</p>
                <p>I went to the New Shepheard's Hotel (the old Shepheard's having burned down) and
                    Bob stayed with our friends. The embassy finally gave us a Foreign Service local
                    to help us through the Egyptian formalities and what we went through was
                    unbelievable. Of course, I had been on a plane for 36 hours to get to Cairo and
                    was not in very good shape - all I wanted to do was sleep. We went from one
                    office to another; it was obvious that one could not get married on a Saturday
                    in Egypt as we hoped and we were told that it might take at least another week.
                    All we did was collect one official stamp after another.</p>
                <p>Finally, thanks to the local employee, we had all the necessary papers. So on
                    Sunday morning, June 8, we went to the Cairo registrar's office for the civil
                    ceremony. The office was piled high with dusty old files and papers up to the
                    top of the 16 feet high ceiling, with a lazy ceiling fan moving slowly around.
                    We had our embassy friends along as witnesses. When the last papers in both
                    Arabic and English were completed, the clerk turned to Bob and said, “Alright,
                    now where is the dowry? How many camels and goats were agreed upon?” I had to
                    tell the clerk that my father didn't have any camels or goats. He looked at Bob
                    as if he had lost all of his marbles - marrying a woman without getting camels
                    and goats - what benefits could he possibly get from this marriage! In any case,
                    that took care of the civil side of the marriage formalities.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>In the afternoon, we went to the Anglican cathedral. All the British clergy had
                    had to leave the country after the Suez invasion, so an Egyptian archdeacon and
                    his assistant presided. Our two friends, Jim and Betty Sartorious, were our
                    attendants and gave me away, and there was an organist and her husband. You
                    can't get much smaller than that but we had a proper service, followed by a
                    small reception hosted by Jim and Betty in their apartment for a few from the
                    embassy. That was our wedding and to this day we don't know if it was all proper
                    and legal. But who knows? Our marriage certificate is in Arabic, with an
                    attestation and translation stamped by the embassy. In any case no one has ever
                    asked to see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We do have Bob's oral history, but just for this record,
                        give us a little background on him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bob Oakley's family was originally from Dallas, Texas where he was born.
                    His parents moved to Shreveport in the mid-1930s and Bob grew up there. His
                    father had been in WWI and had a lot of health problems. His mother and father
                    later divorced. She was very concerned about Bob's education, especially with
                    the public schools in Shreveport, and he was sent off to a small boarding school
                    - South Kent, in Connecticut, beginning in 10th grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know it well since I went to Kent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bob experienced “simplicity of life and directness of purpose” in that
                    old New England atmosphere and it stuck. It was just right for him and he got a
                    good education. He was very bright and I think a hard working student. Bob went
                    from South Kent to Princeton; he graduated with the great class of 1952. He then
                    went to the Naval Officers' Candidate School at Newport and served in naval
                    intelligence for three years in Japan. He did some graduate work at Tulane
                    University in New Orleans before the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Khartoum was his first post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine. Let's go back to your adventures. It doesn't sound
                        like the embassy was very helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I thought the same thing. Looking back on this episode, it really was a
                    pathetic performance on the part of the Cairo embassy. For the consul to say
                    that he couldn't help us, I think, was not acceptable. During this ordeal, we
                    cabled our parents and Bob's mother finally suggested that we go see the
                    ambassador, which would have been a good idea at the start. In the end, it all
                    worked out. We had a wonderful honeymoon in Cairo. I got terribly sick because
                    the hotel's air-conditioning didn't work well at all and I froze or baked.
                    Finally, the hotel had to get an Egyptian doctor to treat my strep throat.</p>
                <p>At last, the newly married couple went to the airport, again in the middle night,
                    to get our flight to Khartoum. Of course, we didn't know whether the plane would
                    take off as scheduled; it did finally and we landed safely at dawn in KhartouBob
                    went right off to work, leaving me in our house to fend for myself, and to
                    sleep. It all seemed a bleak, godforsaken place at first glance, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about life in Khartoum in the
                        mid-1950s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We were immediately put in a furnished house and given a “welcome” kit of
                    dishes and linens, as none of the things I had shipped by airfreight had
                    arrived. We also had a cook in place. A Fletcher classmate was already at post,
                    working for the CIA and he was helpful and welcominBob, of course, had been
                    there for a few weeks and therefore knew his way around slightly. The
                    ambassador, James Moose, gave us a reception. He was quite a character, an old
                    Foreign Service hand and a very good Arabist. Mrs. Moose was a lady of the old
                    school, charming as she swooshed her handkerchief around, entertaining
                    beautifully. She used a “zone defense” for her garden and cocktail parties.</p>
                <p>Our shipments, as I said, had not arrived. We had almost no dishes. Bob finally
                    said, “Go out and buy some. I want to have young Sudanese to the house and to
                    get to know them.” Our colleagues in the embassy were very helpful for the most
                    part. In fact, we had a wonderful Foreign Service community in Khartoum. It took
                    us under its wing and helped us to settle in and made life considerably easier
                    and fun. I remember Fran and Margaret Dickman, Cleo and Lucille Noel, Bob and
                    Nancy Gordon; they all became our Foreign Service family. For the first six
                    months, we did not have a car; we had ordered it but it took that long to reach
                    post. I started to ride all over town on a bicycle that the cook and I shared. I
                    was told that it was a good way to see the Khartoum and it was. We would rent
                    cars occasionally since embassy cars were not available to us, but we did not go
                    very far in those first few months.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Our first house had been occupied previously by someone from the “station,” or
                    the Agency, or CIA. When we moved in everyone thought Bob was his replacement,
                    including British intelligence, who watched us carefully. In fact, I think
                    during our whole tour in the Sudan, many thought that we were CIA agents. It was
                    not credible to many that a Princeton and naval intelligence graduate would be
                    assigned to fixing toilets and other household problems - for which Bob was
                    responsible as GSO. Many thought that this was a very thin cover for a CIA man.
                    Even Mrs. Moose asked me once whether Bob was working for the CIA. So we were
                    under great suspicion. But I think this misimpression became a plus, as we met a
                    lot of people whom we would normally not have seen unless Bob were an undercover
                    agent!</p>
                <p>We did meet a wonderful group of young Sudanese. Most of them had just returned
                    from Cambridge or Oxford after attending Victoria College in Alexandria - a prep
                    school. They were back to help with Sudan's newly achieved independence in 1956;
                    they were much less “fundamentalist” than they and the rest of the country
                    became later. They had young wives, with whom I became well acquainted. Starting
                    out to entertain, we had many misadventures. Once we had a hilarious dinner
                    party where the main course was duck that Bob had shot along the river. Our cook
                    kept shaking his head with reservations about this game, but Bob, the great
                    hunter, assured all that it was safe. He had hung the birds to cure and age. The
                    ducks, of course, ate fish for food and that made the flesh absolutely awful. Of
                    course, I had no idea how to cook a duck; the “Joy of Cooking” was only of
                    limited help. We served the duck but the whole plate was inedible, even
                    vegetables beside the duck. It was awful. So we had our share of adventures in
                    Khartoum.</p>
                <p>We had a good time. I did not have enough to do during the day. I finally took a
                    teaching job at a local girls' school in North Khartoum, run by missionaries. I
                    studied some Arabic, but the tutor was not very good. I regret deeply that I did
                    not apply myself more and get a really good tutor so that I could have made real
                    progress with the language. In those days, it was still the practice in the
                    diplomatic community for newly arrived wives to call on those who had been at
                    post for sometime. Several of us newcomers would go around and call on the
                    British and the French and the Germans, etc., wearing hats and gloves even in
                    the heat of Khartoum. The British had garden parties; we played bridge. Men had
                    to wear “Red Sea Rig” which was a tuxedo without a jacket. The ladies wore
                    English flower print dresses or frocks. I couldn't tell the difference between
                    the flowered dresses worn during the day and those worn at night, but I was told
                    that there was.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>It seemed that we were quite busy socially, primarily because of the young
                    Sudanese we met. We ended up teaching them “Monopoly” which we would play
                    outside in the garden in the evenings, with floor lamps on long extension cords.
                    One of the participants of these soirees was a young man, Monsour Khalid, who
                    later became Sudan's foreign minister. He later became an opposition leader and
                    remains a good friend. We had in our group a young lady from the el Mahdi
                    family, Sarah, who became the first Sudanese girl to go to study in the U.S.,
                    sponsored by some leaders from the League of Women Voters. She actually spent a
                    summer with Warren Buffet and his family in Omaha - this was about 1960. We saw
                    Sarah and the Buffets when we went to Omaha that summer on home leave and Warren
                    and I have talked about her over the years. So somehow or other, a lot of
                    lasting connections were built.</p>
                <p>Bob's mother and grandmother came out for a visit, a remarkable trip. His
                    grandmother was then about 80 years old. She and Mrs. Moose, the ambassador's
                    wife, became immediate dearest friends. In those days, when there were visitors
                    like that, there was a party every night. So we had a good time in Khartoum. We
                    traveled a bit; we visited Addis Ababa by air one time. We went out to see the
                    “Fuzzy Wuzzy” tribe of Kipling fame near Port Sudan on another road trip.</p>
                <p>I must tell one more story. Mrs. Moose had returned to the States to be with her
                    children for Christmas. The ambassador did not go. But he asked Bob to accompany
                    him on a road trip north, across the desert to Wadi Halfa, over the holiday. He
                    didn't ask me; it never occurred to the ambassador that a woman could go on a
                    trip like that. That really made me mad! Bob did not challenge the ambassador's
                    stance or ask to include me; he felt he really was in no position to do so, but
                    he wanted to go and away they went. When I think back on it, I don't think that
                    would happen today. It still irritates me when I think of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the sentiments that Ambassador Moose and others
                        were expressing about the Arab world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: James Moose was considered one of the preeminent Arabists in the
                    Department of State. He had studied Arabic in the 1920s in Paris. The Mooses had
                    had many assignments in the Arab world - in fact they may have been the only
                    assignments they ever had. He had been our ambassador to Syria; when Syria and
                    Egypt merged in 1958, he was out of a job and available for the Sudan
                    assignment. He was rather aloof and withdrawn, although a very experienced
                    officer. Mrs. Moose was wonderful. Bob's grandmother looked at her, discovered a
                    kindred soul from Kentucky, and as I said they became very friendly; she told me
                    that I should watch Mrs. Moose and emulate her in everything she did! She was
                    the perfect, old school helpmate for her husband.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Sudan become independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: The Sudan became independent in 1956. They had a British form of
                    government; i.e. two houses of parliament and a prime minister elected by the
                    lower chamber. It had been ruled as a condominium with Egypt, although the
                    British really called the shots. There was a separate “Sudan Service” in the
                    British Foreign office. As we understood it, the Sudan was considered the “crown
                    jewel” of British colonial service. Therefore British process and style
                    continued after independence. This first government lasted only until 1958, when
                    a bloodless military coup took place, due to some political problems about
                    elections and distribution of power. Then in 1969, General Nimeiri led another
                    military coup that led the Sudan down a more Islamist path.</p>
                <p>Since the first coup was bloodless and the only signs of it were some tanks in
                    the street, the coup really didn't have much significance to us. As the GSO, Bob
                    was not involved professionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems with the tribes in the South
                        during your years in the Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: The South has always been a problem for Khartoum - two very different
                    parts of Africa were put together to form the modern Sudan by the British
                    Colonial Administration. After the AID mission got started, a lot of U.S.
                    assistance was to flow to the south because it was even less developed that the
                    north. We hoped to travel down, or up, the Nile and see some of the south but it
                    was very difficult to get there as transportation was very limited and quite
                    expensive, usually undertaken by charter.</p>
                <p>The southern Sudanese were very tall, thin people; they would often stand on one
                    leg with the other foot propped on the knee to rest. Then they would change
                    legs. Their blue-black skin would absolutely glow. They would sing while working
                    which was a real delight to my ears. There was without question a major division
                    between the north and the south. The south, which was not Moslem, resented the
                    north, and the north thought the south should be converted.</p>
                <p>In the period 1958 to 1960, I did not have a feeling that anything was going to
                    change. The people in Khartoum recognized a southern problem and were simply
                    going to live with it because they foresaw no change. There was a dim hope that
                    economic development would lead to a change in the attitude of the two parts of
                    the country toward each other. Again, I want to reemphasize that Khartoum in
                    this period was not very Islamic. There was a brewery and no prohibitions on
                    liquor sales and consumption. It is true that the Sudanese were always
                    conservative; the women wore something called the “tobe,” which was a long piece
                    of cloth that they would wrap around themselves, over dresses. But that was as
                    much for protection against the sun and the wind and sandstorms than it was a
                    religious statement - much like the Indian sari. The young women were curious
                    and interested in becoming acquainted with me and I made a lot of friends among
                    those that spoke English.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One evening I learned a great lesson. As most of us do, I thought that others
                    would react to events and actions as I did. Very often, when Bob and I
                    (considered almost family) would eat with these young Sudanese friends, men and
                    women would eat together but if there were a stranger or an outsider along, then
                    the two sexes ate separately. One evening when I was to go out and join the men
                    for dinner after talking to a number of my young women friends, chatting about
                    one thing and another, I asked whether they didn't want to join the men for
                    dinner as well. They thought that it might not be proper on that particular
                    evening because of an outsider being present. I asked whether they were not
                    bothered by this discrimination, as I would have been. I was told that it didn't
                    bother them at all but what they were disturbed by was the fact that they
                    couldn't vote. This was after the military coup when no one was voting anyway!
                    This was just the opposite of the reaction I had expected; I had thought that
                    they would first focus on discrimination in the family and then move to the
                    political arena. Instead, they were first of all disturbed by the political
                    practices in the country. I though that this was a very good lesson in how we
                    Americans may completely misunderstand other cultures.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, we had a wonderful time traveling with the chief of the
                    “Fuzzy Wuzzies” of Kipling poem visiting his tribe, the Hadendua, who lived in
                    eastern Sudan in desolate areas of sand and rock. They had some irrigated cotton
                    fields near the Eritrea-Ethiopia border. At one place, we went into a hospital
                    and watched as the medics tried to sew up a fellow who had been slashed by a
                    sword in a tribal fight. When we left the hospital, our host began to laugh. He
                    had been listening to what the women waiting outside the clinic had been saying.
                    They had never seen a white person before and they assumed that we had gone into
                    the clinic to be cured - they were praying that we would be! Very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation with Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was a heavy Egyptian influence on the Sudan, as there has been
                    historically, especially in commerce and education. There were a lot of Egyptian
                    schools and teachers in the Sudan - as well as doctors. So the two countries had
                    a very close relationship. The Sudanese looked to Cairo as the cosmopolitan city
                    of the region - something like an Iowan looking at Chicago. There was not much
                    discussion about Egypt/Sudan relations although I think the Sudanese were wary
                    of the Egyptians. But as I said, in general, the relationship was intimate.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I should tell you one other story. When we were traveling in the eastern Sudan,
                    in several places we watched the process of bringing the herds toward the water
                    holes. The Sudanese would dip a leather bucket into a well, bring it up and
                    spread it over the ground for the animals, mainly camels and goats, to drink.
                    During one of our visits, one of the local herdsmen came up to our host and
                    asked who we were. He was told that we were from the American Embassy, on a tour
                    of the country to see what Sudanese life was like. The local looked over at us
                    standing around and asked, “Don't they have anything better to do?” That has
                    become one of our Oakley family mottos. I thought that was a very perceptive
                    question, particularly from that man, who obviously had other, life sustaining
                    things to do.</p>
                <p>When Bob and I left the Sudan in April 1960 after two years, we were to go back
                    to Washington where Bob was assigned to the Office of United Nations Political
                    Affairs. It seems hard to believe today, but we took a month to get home. We
                    left Khartoum on a train - an old fashioned English-Sudanese one with a steam
                    engine - all the way to the border at Wadi Halfa, a town which was doomed to
                    disappear because of the flooding from the Aswan Dam then under construction. We
                    had some young Sudanese friends who met us there - children of some friends from
                    the Agricultural Service. We drove around the area for a while, looking at date
                    farming that would soon be gone. Then we boarded a river steamer that took about
                    24 hours just to pass the temple of Abu Simbel - we did not disembark but saw it
                    from the river. Then on to Aswan, which was covered with construction equipment
                    and activity.</p>
                <p>From there we took another train to Luxor where we spent three days, visiting the
                    Valley of the Kings and all the wonderful sites and antiquities in that region.
                    An overnight train took us to Cairo. So it was over a week from Khartoum to
                    Cairo - worth every minute in light of what we saw. Then we flew to Amman and
                    visited Jerusalem, most of which was under Jordanian rule at the time. Then on
                    to Beirut and Athens and Munich, where we picked up a car to drive through
                    Germany, visiting a cousin in the U.S. army en route. Then on to Paris and
                    London and Southampton, where we put the car and ourselves on the U.S. United
                    States for New York. We were met by my parents, most anxious to see us after two
                    years. It was a wonderful trip of a month through many of the world's great
                    antiquities and modern Europe. In a way, it was our honeymoon trip, delayed by a
                    couple of years. It still staggers me to think that we were allowed to take that
                    kind of a trip for that long a period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our landing of Marines in Lebanon have any
                        repercussions as far as you were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: No, probably because it was a bloodless landing - no fighting. It was
                    done to preserve Lebanon as an independent country, against Nasser's desires or
                    so we thought at the time. I think there was some resentment against the U.S. in
                    the Arab world, but I don't think it made much of a splash in the Sudan. There
                    certainly was heightened tension between the U.S. and Egypt, but Khartoum was a
                    long way away from Egypt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Soviet involvement in the Sudan at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Soviet embassy activity was just beginning. Sometimes, while attending
                    garden parties, we watched Soviets trying to make contacts and extend their
                    influence, particularly in the commercial area. At some of the large Sudanese
                    parties, where the chairs were set in a large square or circle around the tea
                    table in the middle of the garden, I would glance at the Soviet wives who looked
                    like little tanks, short and squat, with their hair severely pulled back - tough
                    little ladies. One could easily guess what they had been through. We didn't have
                    a common language; some may have spoken some Arabic; none spoke English.
                    Sometimes, we would sit and smile at each other. I think however that the
                    Soviets were probably more active than I was aware.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: Not really. The Sudanese coup in '58 was bloodless, as I said. No shots
                    were fired. Perhaps people stayed at home for a few days, but it was essentially
                    just an extra-legal, peaceful change of government and our lives were untouched
                    by it. We were the youngest couple in the embassy, just recently married, and
                    our friends of comparable ages were not yet involved to any great extent in the
                    political life of the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an upheaval in the souk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not really. There may have been some tensions because of the change of
                    government, but it was not really noticeable to customers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960, you returned to Washington. What happened
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I said, Bob went to work for UN/P in IO. He was not sure what the job
                    was when assigned, but it was an active period at the UN with many newly
                    independent countries. We rented a small apartment just behind the Iwo Jima
                    Monument in Arlington, and crammed it full of wedding gifts we had not seen and
                    souvenirs from the Sudan. A week after Kennedy's inauguration in 1961, our
                    daughter was born - after a major snowstorm. I can well remember the baby being
                    due on the 20th - Inauguration Day - and the predicted snowstorm. First babies
                    are notoriously late so we could wait with friends while watching the
                    Inauguration. I think we had chains permanently on our tires to be sure to make
                    it to the hospital.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In those heady days before the Kennedy inauguration, I will never forget how the
                    appointees to the State Department were announced. Many, like G. Mennen
                    Williams, were of course well known. The announcements were dramatic; President
                    Kennedy came out to meet the press on the porch of his Georgetown house, before
                    January 20th; he made a big deal of announcing even assistant secretary-ships.
                    It was an amazing process. We didn't know anything about Dean Rusk although he
                    was familiar to many others.</p>
                <p>The pace of government activity picked up after January 20th. Bob was working on
                    a lot of UN issues related to the Congo. I can't remember the exact chronology
                    in that unhappy part of the world. In June 1960, Belgium had granted
                    independence; then there was an army mutiny and the announced secession of
                    Katanga from the rest of Congo, under Tshombe. There followed a period of
                    serious unrest which resulted in Lumumba's assassination in early 1961.
                    Opposition to the UN peacekeeping forces continued. So all of this kept Bob
                    quite busy, and he loved it. He was asked to stay for a third year and readily
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>At that point, we moved to a rented house and had a second child, a boy. I
                    couldn't be very active outside the house during those years in Washington, but
                    I did join a group of women, with many from the State Department, being
                    organized to help all the new diplomatic wives recently arrived in Washington.
                    The group was called something like the “The Hospitality and Information
                    Service” or THIS. All sorts of people were trying to participate in this effort,
                    particularly young wives. I assisted when I could, although as I said, I had two
                    young children without a lot of help. We both met a lot of interesting people
                    through this program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a palpable difference when Kennedy became
                        president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think there was. One small group I was part of met with the dashing
                    Angier Biddle Duke, the Chief of Protocol. He told us what a terrific job we
                    were doing, welcoming young diplomatic wives, mainly from Africa. We also met
                    with James Symington who succeeded Duke. Although the group slowly disbanded, I
                    am always amazed by the number of times that I run into members. Some of these
                    activities were funded by the Ford Foundation, to enable neighborhood groups to
                    get to know young diplomatic wives, particularly those from the Third World, so
                    that they would have an interesting tour in Washington and meet Americans. It
                    was an exciting operation, part of the New Frontier. When you remember the
                    number of newly independent countries that sent their first diplomats to the
                    U.S. during this period, you begin to recognize what an invaluable service this
                    entire enterprise provided - and it has continued in various forms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you relate to these young diplomatic wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Easily. After being in the Sudan it was natural for me to be active in a
                    group focused on Africa, with many new, young diplomats assigned to Washington.
                    Also, sometimes Bob and I hosted African students who might be on a summer tour
                    of the U.S. They often needed a place to stay in Washington for a few days and
                    we invited them to stay with us. We had a charming young Ugandan student who
                    stayed with us for two or three days. There were also Sudanese friends who would
                    stay with us, including the young Sudanese woman, Sarah el-Mahdi, about whom I
                    spoke earlier. She was the first woman to come from the Sudan to study in the
                    U.S. In accordance to custom, she later married a cousin who became the
                    President of the Sudan and is still an active politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she any relationship to the el-Mahdi of Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes, indeed. When we arrived in the Sudan, Sarah's grandfather was “the
                    Mahdi.” He was the posthumous son of the original Mahdi who had killed General
                    Gordon around the turn of the century, followed by the British under General
                    Kitchener invading, killing him, and taking over the country. B1958 the grandson
                    was very elderly and not in good health; he died while we were there. We have
                    maintained contact with that family ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any reflections on Adlai Stevenson from Bob's
                        work on the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bob certainly did. While working in UN/P, he was detailed to New York in
                    the fall of 1962 to work on issues involving Africa and other Third World
                    countries. It was a very busy time for those issues; there was at least one time
                    when they had to have Bob clear out the men's room because they needed votes on
                    a key resolution. I visited Bob in New York once just before our second child
                    was due while my mother-in-law babysat with our daughter. I remember it well
                    because it was during that weekend the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted and Bob
                    never got away. So it wasn't much of a visit.</p>
                <p>We wanted very much to go overseas again, back to Africa if at all possible.
                    Before our daughter was born, I had audited a course at Howard University in
                    African studies. I found it very interesting because I had had no academic
                    background in that area. By early 1963, we knew we were going to Abidjan, Ivory
                    Coast, in the summer with a 2 � year old and a baby. Bob had had French at Nice,
                    as had I at FSI. That was a main reason he was assigned as the economic officer.
                    So we bought up all the diapers, baby food and other necessities that we thought
                    we needed; it was the first time I had ever ordered food in such quantities
                    through wholesale outlets. Everything came in cases, milk in powder form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any help in preparing you, with your very
                        young children, for service in an underdeveloped country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Nothing. The post did recommend that we buy certain things, which is why
                    we ordered all that food. We planned to buy a car from someone who was leaving
                    post. The embassy knew that we were coming; in fact, they knew six months in
                    advance. We got to Abidjan after a long, long Pan American flight from
                    Washington to New York to Dakar; and finally Monrovia, which had a little
                    country airport in the jungle. No one knew when the next flight to Abidjan might
                    arrive, so we rented a hotel room at Roberts Field, as we were fifty miles from
                    town. Lo and behold, the plane did land almost on time. We got on and arrived in
                    Abidjan - I remember stepping out of the airplane and thinking that I had just
                    been hit by a wet, hot washcloth. We were taken to our apartment, which was a
                    fourth floor walk-up with an open, empty elevator shaft. That was just great for
                    a 2 � year old! It was a very difficult, dangerous setting with these two very
                    young children - going up and down the steps. I knew I needed a nanny who would
                    basically live with us and help me lug groceries and take care of the children,
                    and I knew I also needed a houseboy to help with the cleaning, the laundry, and
                    serving when we had guests as well as a cook.</p>
                <p>But I found that in Abidjan, the French did not have the same “nanny system” that
                    I had known in the Sudan and other places. Housing was not built so that
                    servants could live with their employers - certainly different from the Sudan
                    where very adequate quarters were available for a household staff. In the Ivory
                    Coast, the servants would come in the morning and leave in the afternoon. People
                    ate their large meal at noon and “rested the rest of the day.” Of course,
                    diplomatic life does not adhere to such a schedule. Finally, we worked out a
                    system. I got a Nigerian “nanny” who spoke English with the children; she also
                    understood that she was needed all day. Then we found houseboys who would stay
                    with the children after they went to bed and while we were attending evening
                    functions. We also had a guard who sat at the gate with his bows and arrows. He
                    was from Upper Volta; unfortunately he didn't speak any French. That didn't help
                    and in general the total setup was difficult to manage, primarily because we
                    didn't have a “nanny” for the 24 hours per day we needed one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a good illustration of the challenges that wives
                        and families face overseas. The husband has his work; the wife is often
                        inexperienced, but has to deal with the practical realities of day-to-day
                        living. What was it like to deal in the foreign culture of the Ivory
                        Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was extremely difficult. Bob went off every morning to the embassy,
                    leaving me to cope with the household and with two little children. The market
                    was downtown, but I didn't know how to get there. We had a car and I slowly
                    learned my way around. It took a long time for my necessary support system to be
                    put in place. We had a washing machine in the kitchen, but nowhere to dry a
                    diaper - this was before disposable ones. So we strung them up on a line in the
                    bedroom, where the baby slept. It became so cold and damp that he got sick. I
                    thought he just had a cold, but I took him to a French doctor who had been
                    recommended. That doctor, after a rudimentary examination of patting his
                    stomach, concluded that the baby had malaria. This didn't make sense because he
                    had been getting a malaria suppressant every Sunday morning (which became a
                    family ritual). I decided that I needed another opinion and after looking around
                    I found a French female pediatrician. She looked at the baby and concluded that
                    he did not have malaria, but indeed a sore throat. She gave him an antibiotic
                    and that did the trick. From then on, she took care of our children's medical
                    needs. I was greatly relieved.</p>
                <p>After a while, we moved into a house that had a backyard and play area for the
                    children. They found some playmates and the family finally settled in. But the
                    beginning of our assignment was an extremely difficult experience. As I
                    mentioned before, we had been instructed to buy all sorts of “necessities” from
                    a wholesaler only to find that there was no storage area, even in the house. So
                    we finally boarded up the garage, put in a dehumidifier, and locked the outside
                    doors to make a storage area. It was obvious that the Embassy's well-intentioned
                    suggestions did not take into account some of the practical problems on the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One would think that once a person has experienced living
                        in a place like the Ivory Coast, he or she could pass it on to someone else,
                        but it doesn't seem to happen often enough. There must have been at least
                        two turnovers of staff since independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That's right. Today, I think arriving at a post is entirely different and
                    much easier. Posts are well set up to receive newcomers with FLOs and CLOs so
                    that young officers don't have to face what we had to in Abidjan. Many people
                    don't remember what it was like arriving at previous posts, especially with
                    babies. But as I said, we finally moved into a second, larger house, and we
                    developed systems and friends, and life became considerably easier.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the course of settling in, we met two young American couples. One was in
                    private industry with a minerals company, and he traveled a lot buying and
                    selling minerals up and down the coast of Africa. The other couple was with the
                    embassy. The six of us just became inseparable. We all had young children and we
                    did a lot of things together. We all loved sports and the beach. By this time,
                    people were beginning to go to the Atlantic Ocean beaches out of town on
                    Sundays. Abidjan itself was built on lagoons that meant you had to cross several
                    bridges to get from your section of town to the beach. There were coconut
                    plantations right up to the shore, and people managed to find and rent small
                    plots under the palms on which they had built what were called “chalets” - small
                    huts where one could change into bathing suits. Many also had covered areas
                    under thatch where you could eat under cover on rough tables and benches. Once a
                    few started this new approach to weekend recreation, the area took off and many
                    young foreigners and diplomats built these small huts, all heading out to the
                    beach on Sunday afternoons. Swimming was very dangerous because of the Atlantic
                    surf breaking full force right on the beach. I had swum in competition in high
                    school and we all were basically good swimmers, but we never went into the water
                    alone. The rip tides were very dangerous; if you were caught in one you felt as
                    if you were inside a washing machine, being tumbled over and over agaiOne would
                    lose all sense of direction and not know up from down. Some lost their bathing
                    suits and had to stand where they could wave for someone to come out with a
                    towel. It was just very rugged but exhilarating and we were very careful,
                    particularly with the children, whom we did not allow to get too close to the
                    surf. It was fun, even though we were very prudent. We did sometimes go beyond
                    the breakers to where we could swim, but only in very calm waters. It was very,
                    very dangerous surf.</p>
                <p>We also played volleyball. We would set up a net, mark the court, and play in the
                    afternoons after lunch, followed by dips in the ocean. We had marvelous gourmet
                    luncheons a la francaise as everybody brought a dish or two.</p>
                <p>However, as idyllic as it sounds, the beach also turned out to be the site of one
                    of our most terrifying days. One afternoon, our two-year old son was playing in
                    the sand while we were eating and cleaning up from lunch. No one was paying any
                    particular attention to this child, as he was quiet and happy. He must have just
                    wandered away and we when we looked we couldn't find him. Bob and I began to
                    circle the area looking for him. We did not think he had entered the water by
                    himself, but we couldn't be sure. We walked in ever increasing circles with no
                    luck and Bob and I were about to collapse in fear and dread. Luckily, one of our
                    close friends with presence of mind got into his car and drove in the direction
                    that Tommy would most likely have gone, parked, and then walked back on the
                    beach toward where we were. Along the way, he met a wonderful black man who was
                    carrying Tommy. He apparently had tired and lay down in some dunes and gone to
                    sleep. I still shudder at the memory; the Ivorian man was our hero and I thanked
                    him properly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Ivory Coast at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: In contrast to the Sudan, we thought it much harder to make friends. The
                    Ivorians were much more reserved and we were not native French speakers. We
                    could get by in that language in social situations, but complicated political
                    discussions, for example, were beyond my knowledge. It was a closed, inward
                    looking society with obvious legacies from the colonial days so that it was much
                    more difficult to get to know people than in the SudaSlowly, we developed a
                    group of “mixed” friends - children of mixed marriages between French and
                    Ivorians, a young Italian bachelor diplomat, a few businesspeople. That gave us
                    the opportunity to get to know people better, but it was a much harder road to
                    travel than in Khartoum. I never felt that I had any close Ivorian women
                    friends. I did teach an English course for USIA, but even that did not give the
                    kind of access to local women that I would have liked to have had. There was no
                    women's association, no group that would allow some social interaction. In
                    Abidjan, there was no system of calling on other diplomats; those we did meet
                    were at the same diplomatic functions. So I found it more difficult to get to
                    know people and to feel at home in Abidjan. I never really felt that I was
                    making much of a contribution to life there.</p>
                <p>I did have one of my life's funniest experiences in Abidjan. As I mentioned, I
                    had a Nigerian nanny for the children and she was a powerhouse. She would argue
                    and seem very upset at times, and then all of a sudden break out laughing. She
                    was basically good humored and knew what she was doing. One day, she came to me
                    and told me that she needed to go to a doctor, being concerned about the health
                    of our children if she were not treated. She told me that she thought she had
                    syphilis. (I suspected she had had it before. We had no idea of what she did
                    during her time off and she was jolly and fun loving, and attractive, too.) I
                    thanked her for telling me and agreed that she should see a doctor. She said
                    that she didn't speak French and therefore I needed to go with her. So I made
                    the appointment and went with her for her blood test at the doctor's office.
                    After her blood had been analyzed, the doctor called me into his office in an
                    embarrassed way and looked shocked when I said I wasn't surprised with the
                    diagnosis. I was wearing everyday clothing, not dressed up at all, looking
                    young, American, and motherly. After he made a few comments about his findings,
                    it dawned on me that he thought I was the patient with the syphilis! He kept
                    looking me in those ordinary clothes and I could see that he was wondering
                    whether I was a secret “swinger.” I finally, I think, assured him that I was not
                    the one whose blood had been tested; it belonged to my Nigerian nanny who was
                    concerned about my children and who wanted penicillin to make sure that the
                    children would not be affected. I am not sure he ever believed me; he kept
                    looking at me to make sure that I wasn't just selling him a bill of goods! I
                    will never forget his look of total disbelief when I tried to explain; it was
                    obviously not what he expected when he called me into his office to have a
                    “serious” conversation. That evening, I told Bob what had happened and it has
                    become a standard joke in the Oakley family. Fortunately, the nanny got her
                    antibiotics and her disease was controlled. Our children were fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>We did try to travel a little around the country. We were able to use embassy
                    vehicles for those trips so that Bob could visit some of the up-country
                    commercial centers and development projects. Cars would break down; this was
                    symptomatic of life in the Ivory Coast; nothing was easy. Bob got sick. He was
                    finally diagnosed with schistosomiasis, a disease that he might have got while
                    swimming in the lagoon. He had to take an arsenic cure that was just awful - the
                    cure was worse than the disease. But he was cured. We took malaria pills, but I
                    came down with a bout of that disease even though I was supposed to have been
                    protected from it. Our regional State Department doctor confirmed that it was
                    malaria. The children got sick with the usual illnesses - such as mumps and
                    colds. I have always viewed our tour in the Ivory Coast as quite difficult.</p>
                <p>Of course, it seemed a lot harder in part because we had two children. We also
                    did a lot, as I said, with our Italian friend, and with a German diplomatic
                    family and a young French couple. We all lived close to each other and remain
                    friends to this day, our children exchanging visits in the summer. So I think in
                    general it all turned out quite well. Bob liked his work. He felt that the
                    Ivorians were making progress economically; there was interest in the Ivory
                    Coast's development program that focused on coffee and cocoa development in the
                    hands of small farmers. As Indochina reduced its rubber production, there was a
                    growing market for that product as well. The French were guiding this economic
                    development program. Most importantly, there was not much corruption, because of
                    some very serious, tough ministers supported by the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For many years, the state of agriculture was the measure
                        that was used to judge the economic development of African states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely. We stayed in the Ivory Coast for two years. Toward the end of
                    that period with another year ahead of us, I could see that Bob was getting
                    itchy. The Department at this juncture was asking for volunteers to go to
                    Vietnam. Bob thought that this might be an interesting assignment and he
                    volunteered for it. At the time, families of officers assigned to Vietnam were
                    still permitted to go, too. But by the time we were ready to leave Abidjan in
                    June of 1965, the Department had evacuated families from Vietnam because of
                    growing security threats. The embassy was growing by leaps and bounds and it was
                    very challenging politically, but when families were evacuated, the question
                    arose between us whether Bob should still go. He did not think he could withdraw
                    and keep his head up with his friends who were going. How different the Service
                    was in those days! If you had an assignment, you saluted and went regardless of
                    the circumstances. I was not happy, but I understood that that was the way the
                    Foreign Service was run in the 1960s. I don't think I would have had the same
                    reaction later - or that we would have stayed married.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>We made plans to return to the U.S. with Bob leaving for Vietnam after a brief
                    vacation and getting me settled. My father had had a bad heart attack and was
                    retiring from his business, Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., in St. Louis, and
                    moving to California in semi-retirement. I didn't know anybody out there. Bob's
                    mother and grandmother were living in Shreveport, Louisiana, and this clearly
                    was the best place for me. I could rent a small house there with plenty of
                    family and friends around until Bob was reassigned from Vietnam. He was supposed
                    to come home every six months during his 18 month/two year tour.</p>
                <p>So the children and I moved to Shreveport. Bob was excited to go to Vietnam - he
                    felt it was a great challenge, the “brightest and best” were going and they were
                    all convinced they could win in spite of the insurgents from the north. Bob was
                    sure that that was were the action was going to be. That was the prevalent mood
                    of the day.</p>
                <p>Adjusting to Shreveport was both easy and hard. I had good household help for the
                    children. Bob's mother and grandmother knew everyone in town, so I quickly was
                    known and invited around town and made to feel a part of life there. People were
                    very generous and kind, inviting me for lunch or dinner or for an evening's
                    movie. I lived across the street from Bob's closest childhood friend. His wife
                    and I became very good friends as our children were the same ages, and she
                    remains so today. We still travel together for vacations. Now our children's
                    children are friends; they are the fifth generation of a close relationship,
                    which is quite remarkable. Our daughter went to the same school her father
                    attended, with many family friends, so the children became quickly acclimated to
                    their new surroundings. They loved playing in the neighborhood. I played tennis
                    often and I did quite a bit of volunteer work - all very pleasant but not very
                    stimulating. I had gone by the local college, Centenary, to see if they needed
                    any assistants when I first arrived and was told they didn't, which was
                    disappointing. Out of the blue the next May, one of the professors had a heart
                    attack and a dean called me to fill in in summer school.</p>
                <p>So within a week I started to teach American history - five days a week for two
                    hours each day to a class of 60 students! I had never even taken American
                    history in college, so I didn't really have the right background, but it was a
                    challenge and a thrill. I had taken courses on American political thought,
                    American economic history and American diplomatic history, and of course I had
                    been reading avidly forever - and sat down to read the text book cover to cover.
                    I walked into my first class and used up my lecture in 30 minutes - and then had
                    class discussion. Somehow or other, I got through the six week course, learned a
                    lot, and kept one jump ahead of the students - who, frankly, were not very
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the student body?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was mixed. There were a number of public school teachers who had to
                    take the course to meet requirements. There were some veterans who had been
                    recently discharged and were able to take college courses. There were some who
                    took courses for the sheer pleasure of learning. There were some students from
                    other colleges who wanted to get their American history requirement out of the
                    way before the start of football season. So it was a very mixed group. I
                    acquired the reputation of being very tough. I thought that this first working
                    experience, teaching, was wonderful, and I have always said that if I hadn't had
                    that experience, which required an active mind, I probably never would have
                    returned to work later in life. This opportunity was pure chance and fate; it
                    was an opportunity that no one could have foreseen. The following fall, I taught
                    in the evening division - continuing education - for a whole academic year and
                    that also was fun but thankfully less demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the campus sentiments on Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There wasn't much of an anti-war sentiment because Shreveport was a small
                    southern city near Barksdale Air Force Base, a heavy military presence close by.
                    I don't think there was any enthusiasm for the war, but in the mid-1960s, there
                    was no organized opposition to it in Shreveport.</p>
                <p>Bob came home from Vietnam for two visits. Once he returned on Henry Cabot
                    Lodge's airplane - he was the Ambassador in Saigon. We had a telephone call
                    during the second home visit, December 1966, with the news that because of his
                    good work in Vietnam, our next assignment would be Paris! That was thrilling, as
                    was the idea that Bob would be completing his assignment in Vietnam a little
                    early, allowing us to start a new life together in Paris. We anxiously looked
                    forward to France.</p>
                <p>As I said, Bob returned from Vietnam twice during his tour for extended visits. I
                    found these visits very difficult and strained because his return was not
                    permanent. In his absence, I had developed a life of my own, the children were
                    attending school, and we all were settled in. So we had a rhythm to our lives
                    which his visits disrupted. We would adjust to his presence and just as we did
                    he would be off again. I have often thought about this pattern and how difficult
                    separation was for the many military and Foreign Service families when the men
                    were in Vietnam, or Korea, or WWII at an earlier time. It was a very difficult
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience when I came back. My wife was a
                        student. It wasn't easy. Obviously the separation did not work very
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was a difficult situation for us and I am sure for many others,
                    because these visits were so disruptive and temporary. In June 1967, Bob came
                    home for good and that changed everything. I remember packing for Paris during
                    the 1967 Middle East war. We said goodbye to family and friends in Shreveport,
                    packed our station wagon, and headed off to Washington. Eventually the car and
                    all these belongings made it to Paris. In Washington, we camped out with
                    friends. Bob spent a lot of time in the Department being debriefed about
                    Vietnam. He was asked why he was going to Paris; many thought his next
                    assignment should have been in Washington on the Vietnam working group in the
                    Asian Bureau and it was obvious that the EAP bureau would have much preferred to
                    keep Bob in Washington. But we had our orders and tickets to Paris and even an
                    apartment. Bob had stopped there on his way back from Vietnam to see what he was
                    going to be doing and had rented a lovely, old apartment in 7th arrondissement,
                    across the street from the DCM, on avenue Emil Deschannel, near the Champs de
                    Mars. While the debate about where Bob should be was going on, we drove to New
                    York, put car and luggage on the USS United States, and sailed before they could
                    reach us!</p>
                <p>We were all properly outfitted for an ocean voyage and what an adventure that
                    was, sailing at the end of June from New York Harbor. Our daughter had been
                    given a doll with clothes that matched every outfit she had. Our son had similar
                    toys. Bob and I thought we would for dinner as was done in those days only to
                    find it was too much trouble to get the children ready and fed first - we ended
                    up eating together, early. There were a number of other Foreign Service families
                    aboard whom we got to know. Most of their children came down with chicken pox,
                    which required quarantine. But we had a fine voyage and landed hale and hearty
                    in LeHavre after about five days. We drove into Paris on the 4th of July, where
                    we were taken to a temporary apartment, which was quite satisfactory, until our
                    permanent apartment was ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Paris from 1967 until 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right. We left in the summer of 1969. This was a much easier landing - I
                    had an American friend in Paris who took me under her wings and told me all that
                    I needed to know, what schools the children should attend, where we should live,
                    and she even helped us get a maid. Bob went to work and I settled in in August.
                    Soon after our arrival, a Foreign Service officer in Tunis was PNGed and
                    assigned to the Paris embassy, really to Bob's job as a place to put him. (I
                    don't understand how Personnel did this!) At the same time, the Washington
                    Vietnam working group had decided they really wanted Bob to come back, so about
                    four weeks after arriving, Bob's assignment was in doubt. It was a very messy
                    situation. In the end, Bob was probably allowed to stay because we had a lease.
                    The work was divided between them - until the later arrival was assigned to
                    Washington after about a year in Paris. Bob was working on just Africa at first,
                    at the time of the Biafra War, and later added the Middle East.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I must say that our first year in Paris was very pleasant but rather dull
                    politically. We had a lovely apartment and we settled in quickly, with the
                    children off to their bilingual school. They were learning French with some
                    adjustment problems, par for the course. But in the spring of 1968, the world
                    erupted. It was May 1968 Les evenements de mai, 1968]. All of France was in an
                    uproar - the garbage men were striking, the teachers were striking, the students
                    were taking to the streets. It was a real upheaval in French life and it changed
                    the environment dramatically. De Gaulle did stay on after his march down the
                    Champs Elysees, but he had lost his luster. French society began to modernize in
                    many ways. From French history, I think the French almost have to change
                    violently every half-century or so. Change might not happen otherwise.</p>
                <p>We made some wonderful French friends. We met again a number of people we had
                    known in Abidjan and that was fun for us - it gave us some feeling of
                    continuity. Then the Paris Peace talks on Vietnam began with Cyrus Vance,
                    Averell Harriman, Dick Holbrooke, John Negroponte - who acted as a translator.
                    Most of them were, of course, Bob's friends from Vietnam. Life stopped being
                    dull. Sargent Shriver came as ambassador, following Chip Bohlen, and he was a
                    whirlwind. It was a new France and a new atmosphere which was great fun.</p>
                <p>I was perfectly willing to stay in Paris after the first two years. Bob liked the
                    job, but found the Europeans too tame. He used to say that in Europe a crisis
                    was when some country sent a stiff diplomatic note, not revolutionaries over the
                    wall. He was offered a very good job in New York handling Middle Eastern
                    questions at the UN, which were hot. He was to work for Bill Buffum, who was the
                    deputy ambassador at USUN. Bob had worked for Buffum earlier when both were in
                    IO/UNP. Bob thought the New York job would be more fun. So after two years in
                    Paris, we moved to New York in the summer of 1969. In those days, Foreign
                    Service families were on their own in New York - no one helped them find housing
                    and there were no allowances. We didn't want to live in the suburbs, as it would
                    not have been a “New York” experience. Finally, with the help of some people in
                    our mission, we found a place at Kip's Bay, which was owned by Alcoa. We started
                    in a two-bedroom apartment but after a year a three- bedroom opened up and we
                    were able to spread out a bit, and have a few guests. The children went to the
                    UN school that had a bilingual program. But I must say that we found the
                    assignment to New York a difficult adjustment. The children particularly faced
                    challenges; they had been in Shreveport schools for two years, Paris for two
                    years, and then had to start all over again in New York for two years. They were
                    placed in the French section of the UN school and that didn't work too well for
                    our son, but was fine for our daughter. Once again, I had to find a church to
                    join, doctors to take care of our medical needs, and grocery stores, without the
                    help of an Embassy. Slowly, we became reaclimatized. I got a part-time job
                    working on international affairs for the National Board of the YWCA, working
                    basically while the children were in school. I helped the YWCA with their
                    international programs and outreach; this was my introduction to the NGO
                    [non-governmental organizations] community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Y doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: The Y was quite neutral on the Vietnam War. It was much more concerned
                    with social issues - racism, education, and welfare. It was not part of the
                    large anti-war protest movement, which was often led by churches. The late 1960s
                    and early 1970s were the beginning of the drug culture, very visible in New
                    York. I saw kids on the streets begging for money to support their habits. There
                    was a lot of tumult in the U.S. and New York had its fair share, even if much of
                    the leadership came from the West Coast.</p>
                <p>We had many friends who were, of course, old hands in New York, friends from
                    college and childhood. We ran into a lot of UN diplomats whom we had known in
                    previous assignments. The accumulation of friends over a period of years from
                    different settings becomes more pronounced with each move. We were reaching the
                    stage that wherever we might have been assigned, and of course especially at the
                    UN, we would run into friends from previous postings. We enjoyed that. Bob
                    really liked his work; he was working for Charles Yost with Mike Newlin and Bill
                    Buffum, and others whom he admired. Then George Bush came as ambassador,
                    succeeding Yost, in the spring of 1971.</p>
                <p>By this time, we knew we were leaving on another assignment. We loved New York,
                    but it was difficult financially, even with my part-time job, and our families
                    did not have a “country home” outside New York for weekends, although my parents
                    had rented a place for two weeks on Martha's Vineyard the summer of 1970. We did
                    enjoy the hospitality of a number of friends who had weekend houses outside the
                    city. Nevertheless, two years was enough. When in early 1971 Bill Buffum asked
                    Bob to join him as political counselor in Beirut, where he was going as
                    ambassador, we jumped at the chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While in New York, did you have much of an opportunity to
                        participate in the UN social scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We were pretty far down in the pecking order so we were not included in a
                    lot of social affairs. But as I said, we had a lot of foreign diplomatic friends
                    and we enjoyed a social life with them, usually by means of small dinners. We
                    enjoyed that thoroughly. I remember meeting Ambassador Chris Phillip's wife -
                    Mabel - at a YWCA lunch. She asked me what I was doing in New York; I told her
                    that my husband was in the political section of USUN, where her husband was one
                    of the ambassadors. I also confessed that I had never met anyone I had not known
                    before at USUN, New York. That fact, that there was no gathering for all the
                    USUN people and spouses to meet each other, I think, began to have some impact
                    and at least one annual get-together was started at which we could meet each
                    other. There just had been no attempt to organize anything for newcomers before
                    then, not at all like a small Embassy. That introductory effort helped
                    considerably and I met a couple of wives of other officers in the political
                    section. We did need some means to pull us together.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I enjoyed the things I did in New York. We joined a small Episcopal church close
                    by, and I became the Girl Scout leader at the Central Synagogue. So I had a real
                    entry into New York life, working with a lot of public high school students. In
                    the spring, I took the troop camping with help from the New York Girl Scout
                    Federation. We went to a camp upstate, great excitement for these girls who had
                    never been out of the city. One camper leaned against a tent and fell, breaking
                    her wrist. That was the hard way to learn that tent flaps were not walls! What
                    an experience for all of us as we got her to the hospital.</p>
                <p>I loved New York as did Bob, but it was exhausting and expensive and we didn't
                    feel permanent, although we did the best we could. It was also very difficult
                    with young children. We were ready to move on to Beirut in the summer of 1971.
                    After two two-year tours, we were ready for a three-year post, which we had from
                    1971 to 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Beirut like in the early 1970s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Beirut was the Paris of the Middle East and it was at its prime in this
                    period, before the civil war began. Our arrival in July seemed easy; we were met
                    at the airport and taken to the Phoenicia Hotel, which did not lack for
                    amenities. It had a swimming pool that got plenty of use from our children. The
                    embassy staff were very friendly, calling on us as soon as we arrived and
                    inviting the children to come to play at their houses. Everyone was eager to
                    help the newcomers. After a short period, we moved to a magnificent apartment
                    overlooking the Mediterranean. The embassy could not have been more helpful and
                    all the staff nicer.</p>
                <p>I have compared our reception in Beirut to the one we got when we reached
                    Abidjan. Of course, the children were older and Bob was a much more senior
                    officer; nevertheless you could tell how much embassy services had improved from
                    one time to another.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The Ambassador was Bill Buffum and the DCM was Bob Houghton. We lived right under
                    the Houghtons, who had five children. Bob could walk to the embassy, which was
                    just a couple of blocks away on the Corniche, right along the Mediterranean Sea.
                    The children walked in a group with their schoolmates to school which was also
                    two or three blocks away in the other direction. They attended the American
                    Community School. The campus of the American University of Beirut was right
                    behind their school. So we were well situated and life was perfectly lovely. I
                    still remember how people were so warm in their reception of the Oakley family
                    and I think Beirut was probably the happiest Foreign Service tour for us.
                    Everyone has happy memories of one special post. Beirut was ours. The children
                    were in a good school and they were at an age when they were eager to learn. We
                    lived comfortably; we had a beach chalet that we used in the summer when we
                    wanted to swim in the Mediterranean. In the winter, we would go up into the
                    mountains to ski. Life was relatively easy; good food was readily available. It
                    was easy to organize one's life to do all the things expected of a senior
                    officer. We knew where to get good help for dinner parties; so although very
                    busy, it was not too hard to manage a full plate.</p>
                <p>There were always lots of things to do in Beirut. We made a lot of Lebanese
                    friends and had a lot of visitors. There were a lot of American journalists
                    covering the Middle East who used Beirut as a headquarters. Beirut was also the
                    site for banks, media, UN organizations; everyone wanted to be assigned to
                    Beirut to cover not only Lebanon but the whole of the Middle East. Frankly, we
                    had a great time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Lebanese society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was almost too much. Lebanese were and are the most hospitable people
                    on earth. I always thought that one should be able to speak two of the three
                    main languages of the country: English, Arabic and French. I knew two of those
                    before I arrived and took a little Arabic while living in Beirut. It was so easy
                    to make Lebanese friends. The president was Suleiman Franjieh, who had a son
                    named Tony, married to a young woman, Vera, who had been brought up in
                    Alexandria. She and I became very close friends. The two of us would go to lunch
                    and chat about everything. All that we talked about remained between us; it was
                    not to be repeated either to the American government or the Lebanese government.
                    She was terrific. She was killed during the civil war with her husband and
                    infant daughter, which was such a sad ending for a lovely person.</p>
                <p>We also became very close friends with an American couple of Lebanese descent who
                    were living in Beirut while he worked as a lawyer. I had known him at an earlier
                    time at Northwestern, although he was two years older. Our children were very
                    compatible. We took many trips together in the area and they have remained close
                    friends ever since here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any rifts in the society that eventually
                        led to its civil war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes. We would pass Palestinian camps on the way to the airport or the
                    beach. They were just plain slums spreading out from the city. People used to
                    make the same comments about these refugee camps as they made about Harlem - “We
                    know that they are happy living there, they like it in there; it's the way they
                    want to live, but we wouldn't go there ourselves.”</p>
                <p>We had some Palestinian friends, mostly from the AUB faculty. We knew from them
                    that the refugees were not living an acceptable life. The disparities that
                    existed within Lebanese society were blatantly apparent as well. Social services
                    were provided by the churches or mosques on a confessional basis, as there were
                    precious few governmental social services. The schools were terrible, the roads
                    worse; much more could have been provided, but the leaders seemed more
                    interested in business deals and the social whirl. Furthermore, they maintained
                    that this was the way the Lebanese wanted it. But you had to wonder about this
                    attitude and whether the country could hold together with such disparities
                    between the privileged and non-privileged, the rich and the poor.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1973, there was a Palestinian uprising against government
                    troops. It really ended without a victor, as both sides simply stood down. The
                    Palestinians then came to understand what they needed to do to affect the way
                    the Lebanese government was treating them. This was also a period in which the
                    Israelis were conducting all sorts of raids into Beirut; they invaded beach
                    houses and apartments to kill moderate Palestinian leadership. It was a time of
                    intense and violent political activity as Arafat began to make his moves,
                    culminating in Black September in Jordan. Thus there was great unrest among
                    Palestinians wherever they may have been living. After this one episode in 1973,
                    the confrontation between the PLO and the Lebanese government was suspended;
                    neither side wanted to lose. The PLO went underground and the government
                    declared that all was well. But in fact, none of the issues was resolved. The
                    Palestinians hunkered down and prepared themselves for the real civil war that
                    broke out in 1975, when the situation became more deadly with outside players
                    meddling - and Lebanon tore itself apart.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the 1973 October war between Israel and
                        Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: That was another major political factor in the whole equation that I
                    should have mentioned. I can remember that Bob and I were having a late Saturday
                    lunch out of town with friends, when he got a call from the embassy that called
                    him back to the Embassy right away. He explained what was happening along the
                    Israeli borders, with troops moving, but we did not really know in detail what
                    was going on. The Syrians and the Egyptians moved very quickly and seized
                    considerable territory. The Israelis counterattacked with U.S. military
                    equipment and pushed the Egyptians and the Syrians back, crossing the Suez Canal
                    into Egypt. The Lebanese did not participate in this conflict, but were clearly
                    supporting Syria and Egypt. It was all over rather quickly. Then Kissinger's
                    “shuttle diplomacy” started and various disengagement agreements were slowly
                    reached. The dispute over the Golan Heights ended in a truce, at least for a
                    prolonged period. Again, there was a feeling that nothing was permanently
                    settled and what we had witnessed was just another phase of the Middle East
                    conflict. Bob was in touch with numerous friends and contacts and kept up as
                    best he could on rapidly moving events.</p>
                <p>Also in early 1973, our old friend Cleo Noel, the U.S. Ambassador to the Sudan,
                    was assassinated. This was another manifestation of the unstable Middle East
                    situation of the 1970s. So our time in Lebanon became increasingly tense; there
                    were periodic curfews during which all movements were limited. One time, we were
                    driving to have dinner with a friend, who later became the president of Lebanon,
                    and we got caught in a traffic jam, which made Bob very nervous, although we had
                    taken off our diplomatic license plates. He felt we might be seen and targeted.
                    We started to have a guard outside our front door; it was obvious that tensions
                    were rising rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your social life with the Lebanese, was Israel a topic
                        of conversation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Certainly. We talked about American positions on Arab issues, the role of
                    the PLO, and what a settlement might look like, as well as Lebanese politics. As
                    super-charged political animals, the Lebanese lived and breathed these issues
                    and they would discuss their role and perspective in this part of the world at
                    great length. We had friends in the embassy in Tel Aviv with whom we exchanged
                    visits. It was important for all American diplomats in the Middle East to travel
                    throughout the area and understand both sides.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>There was a very active American Women's Club in Beirut with about 300 members.
                    It sponsored language classes, bridge lessons, art and archaeology tours, as
                    well as general travel. The tours were so good that a couple of the women who
                    ran them became professional travel agents. Forty of us did a camel trip through
                    Wadi Ramm in Jordan in late April, 1974. The club had a wonderful group of
                    people. There were a lot of Americans in Beirut then, with business, the
                    schools, as journalists, and visitors and the embassy had a full range of U.S.
                    government programs: military assistance, AID projects, and public affairs. The
                    UN had many representatives and UNRWA headquarters was in Beirut. So there was a
                    large group of expatriates and diplomats. In retrospect, all things considered,
                    I know Beirut was our favorite family assignment.</p>
                <p>Sometime during out tour, we began to hear that the State Department was changing
                    in regard to women. The issue of married women in the Foreign Service had been
                    revisited and policies were changing - for example, women were no longer
                    required to resign when they married. So I went to see the Embassy's personnel
                    officer and told her that in light of the policy changes being implemented and
                    in the likely event of a next assignment to Washington, I would want to apply
                    for a return to the Foreign Service. The personnel officer suggested that I not
                    wait until the summer of 1974, but that I submit my request right away. She knew
                    that the process would take some time and she, wisely, was prepared in lend a
                    hand in getting the paperwork completed in Beirut and submitted to the
                    Department. So I prepared all the documents and letters required. That personnel
                    officer was very helpful.</p>
                <p>By the end of June, 1974, we were all back in Washington. Bob had been pulled out
                    of Beirut earlier in the spring to be in Geneva if Middle East peace talks
                    started there, but I stayed so that the children could finish school. I knew by
                    then that in the fall my request for reentry would be approved and that I would
                    rejoin the Foreign Service. At this point, I felt I could do it - our daughter
                    was going to enter high school - the National Cathedral School - and our son was
                    going into junior high, and we would probably be in Washington for a while. So
                    the timing for reentry was quite propitious and soon after our return to
                    Washington, I “came back in.”</p>
                <p>I should say one other thing about my decision. I have never denigrated the role
                    of women and wives in the Foreign Service; I was “wife of” for sixteen years and
                    know how difficult it is to manage a family under very trying circumstances and
                    many moves. The management of children and a household and the required social
                    life was a full-time job. We had wonderful posts; I did volunteer work when I
                    could. I did learn what it took to play a contributing role in the Foreign
                    Service overseas and it was an invaluable education. So I didn't reenter the
                    work force because I looked down at the role of a Foreign Service wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I certainly agree with that, but it is very hard to impart
                        that point to succeeding generations. My wife certainly played a major role
                        in my overseas assignments. I think that attitude changed later on, but I do
                        believe that the U.S. had a much more solid representation abroad because we
                        had these husband-wife teams that worked so well together for the benefit of
                        the U.S.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I mentioned before, when we were in Khartoum, Bob's grandmother came
                    to visit us and told me to watch the ambassador's wife and do everything she did
                    because she was a paragon of virtue - managing the household, entertaining, and
                    assisting the ambassador in making sure that the embassy staff cared for
                    newcomers and others who might have needed some special attention. By the time
                    we went to New York in 1971, I think this atmosphere had changed. Of course, New
                    York was a unique posting, but in general the feeling of an “embassy family” was
                    rapidly disappearing. People were very much more on their own, and it could be a
                    big, lonely city, and yet I really didn't mind because it gave me considerably
                    more liberty to do what I wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings us to 1974. Tell us what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I said, we came back to Washington, our first time back since 1963.
                    That meant getting the children into schools, finding a house, and setting up a
                    new household. It all got done, although some problems took longer than
                    others.</p>
                <p>Bob originally had been assigned to the Senior Seminar, but that was changed
                    early in the summer to a position on the Policy Planning staff, although by the
                    fall he was reassigned again, this time to the NSC staff to replace Hall
                    Saunders on the Middle East. My application to rejoin the Foreign Service was
                    approved and I more or less told that I had to find a job - no one seemed in
                    charge of placing me.</p>
                <p>I have always said that the Foreign Service was not society's leader, but a
                    follower. In the late 1960s and 1970s, American views on working women and
                    women's rights evolved - rather quickly. Society came a long way in a short
                    period of time. On the other hand, it took the concerted effort of a group of
                    concerned women in the Foreign Service to get change moving in that institution.
                    The first major case was that of Allison Palmer. She sued the Department over
                    its assignment policies and was helped by other women who also felt
                    discrimination. She with others opened up a whole range of women's issues in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I remember that a couple of years earlier I had spoken with Cleo Noel, a very
                    good friend who was working in the Office of Personnel. He had been assigned by
                    Bill Macomber, the Deputy Under Secretary for Management, to develop the
                    Department's defense of the existing policy on forcing the retirement of women
                    from the Foreign Service when they married. Macomber wanted to know what tack
                    the Department's defense would take. He was told by Cleo and others in Personnel
                    that there wasn't any defense. It was a policy that had just developed over
                    years and never reviewed. But the world had moved on and that policy needed to
                    be eliminated.</p>
                <p>I think also that as the Department looked at the issue of what to do with those
                    who had been forced to resign because of an archaic policy, it recognized that
                    it applied to so few cases that it was not worth a battle. It was simply easier
                    and less costly to open up the system for those who wished to rejoin. Not only
                    were there so few cases to begin with, but many of the small number who had left
                    had gone on to other careers and would not wish to rejoin. I never knew exactly
                    how many there were of us - I would guess under 20.</p>
                <p>The Department's decision was certainly the right one, both statistically and
                    operationally. It shouldn't have been very hard. When we were in Beirut, I knew
                    that this issue was really bubbling in Washington. As I said, thanks to the
                    advice of the personnel officer, I immediately applied for reinstatement when we
                    heard that the policy had been changed as it indeed took some time. So my
                    processing started in April or May, 1974 and was finished in October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seemed to be right on the timing because Bob was a
                        senior officer by this time and had been assigned to Washington. Were you
                        concerned what might happen once both of you were eligible for an overseas
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: One remarkable aspect of my reentry was that there was so little
                    discussion of that issue. Everyone assumed that finally back in Washington we
                    would be there for some time. The problem of the first overseas tour did not
                    seem to loom very large at the time, either between Bob and me or in the
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I was fortunate enough to have Bill Buffum, our former Ambassador in Beirut,
                    offer me a job in UN/P (UN Political Affairs) in IO (where Bob had started)
                    handling most Middle East questions, including the PLO. I worked directly for
                    John Baker who was the office director. I was struck very early in this process
                    by how little I actually knew about the organization of the Department and how
                    it worked even though I had been associated with it for many years. I laughed
                    very hard when after writing my first cable our secretary came to ask me what
                    “tags” I wanted on the form. I looked at her dumbfounded. I didn't know what she
                    was talking about. The women who had applied for reinstatement and had been
                    accepted were given no refresher training at all. I guess the powers-that-be
                    must have thought that as a wife I would have known all about the organization
                    and processes of the Department. In retrospect, one reason I was so green in so
                    many ways was because these were matters Bob had never discussed with me. He
                    didn't care or talk a lot about process. So I knew little about how the
                    Department actually worked, but I did have some advantages in that I knew about
                    Beirut and the Middle East. So I did not have many problems with substance, but
                    I certainly had to learn from scratch mundane things like tags on cables and
                    “memcons.”</p>
                <p>When I reentered the Foreign Service, as I said, I had had the experience of
                    living abroad in many different places. I had taught American history in a small
                    college in Louisiana, while Bob was serving in Vietnam. I had worked as a
                    part-time consultant in international affairs for the YWCA, working essentially
                    as an NGO. I had headed the American Women's Club in Beirut that gave me a some
                    managerial background. So I was not exactly inexperienced, but I did find that
                    none of this really counted when I reentered the FS. As I had resigned as an
                    FSO-8, there was an issue of what new grade I should be offered. The first
                    suggestion was FSO-7 but I thought I should be offered something higher - FSO 6
                    or 5 in light of my age and experience.</p>
                <p>I had heard that someone whom I had known in Beirut, who clearly was opposed to
                    allowing married women back into the Foreign Service, served on the panel that
                    was discussing the issue of my new grade level. So there were hints of bias on
                    the part of those who could not reconcile themselves to new times. At that
                    point, I was happy enough to be returning to the Foreign Service so I decided
                    not to challenge the offer of a 7. In retrospect, I made a mistake. It does take
                    time to reach every level in a career system. I would have been better off to
                    have reentered at a more reasonable rank. There was no one to turn to for advice
                    on what to do with the Department's offer.</p>
                <p>Also about this time, the Department changed its ranking system. It dropped the
                    FSO-8 designation and reordered all personnel into a new system. I was moved up
                    to FSO-6. Thereafter, I was promoted rather quickly and I probably made up for
                    lost time. Nevertheless, I think, had I been given what I think I deserved based
                    on my experience, it would have made a difference. I attribute the Department's
                    position to outdated thinking by men who were resisting the expansion of women's
                    rights in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is I think not a surprise that men feeling increased
                        competition might well have resisted the new policies. But did you find
                        career women in IO who also opposed the new approaches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not really. You have raised an interesting question that I did not
                    consider at the time, or since. I never received anything but full support and
                    encouragement from the women in IO. We were a new phenomenon; I claimed, and it
                    was undoubtedly true, that I was the oldest FSO-7 in the Service. Everyone knew
                    that Bob was a rising star. The question was whether I could make it in the
                    Foreign Service. Would good things happen to me - and us? Would it all work? In
                    that sense, I felt I was given more encouragement than neglect or hostility,
                    although I am sure that there were people who disapproved of what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort made among the reentrants to plea
                        with the Department for some short reentry training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: No. There were so few of us that neither we nor the Department were
                    pro-active. So there was no training, no luncheon meetings, no nothing. I did
                    have a long transition period with my predecessor, Xenia Wilkinson, which was
                    very helpful because she spent at lot of time tutoring me. The other people in
                    IO were also extremely helpful. There were two or three other newcomers in the
                    bureau - a fellow named John Teft, who has just been named ambassador to one of
                    the Baltic states and an officer by the name of Molly Williamson, married to an
                    FSO as well, although she joined after marriage. We were all learning together.
                    I think that most of the people in the office tried their best to help but there
                    were a few who I think probably did not view the Department's new policy with
                    enthusiasm. They also may have had some questions about how and why I had gotten
                    this very good job in IO.</p>
                <p>Our office director, John Baker, seemed a rather difficult and cold man, but I
                    must say I now have more sympathy for him. He probably should have insisted that
                    I get some training. I was very green and not accustomed to State's office
                    routines and therefore probably not much help at the beginning. I had to learn
                    all of this on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that is probably the experience of many Foreign

                <p>OAKLEY: I must say that I did have a wonderful job. I was handling aspects of the
                    Middle East that were never very far from the top of the UN agenda. My job was
                    to keep the PLO out of the UN, the Israelis in; I must say I did much better on
                    the latter than on the former - they were finally admitted in 1974 over our
                    objections. We were all dealing with a continual stream of urgent issues, such
                    as votes on membership and questions with the specialized agencies, which became
                    proxy political battlegrounds for the Arab-Israeli conflict. It turned out that
                    eventually I became the bureau's expert on Middle East questions in these
                    specialized agencies. I didn't think my drafting initially was very good, but
                    over a period of time, I think my writing became acceptable.</p>
                <p>It was helpful that through Bob's job at the NSC, handling the Middle East, I met
                    many of the Arab diplomats in Washington. We became increasingly friendly and
                    they knew what my job was in the Department. I spent a lot of time in the NEA
                    bureau working with people we had known in Beirut and other posts. I think that
                    having so many friends and acquaintances was very helpful; I didn't have to go
                    through a “becoming acquainted” period on a personal level; I could hit the
                    ground running in that sense. I will admit that I had some uneasiness at times,
                    because any woman coming back or entering the Foreign Service would have to face
                    certain prejudices. I sometimes felt ill at ease, particularly when I didn't
                    know my interlocutors. I wondered whether they would take me seriously or
                    whether I would be seen merely as a token for some new personnel policy. I used
                    to tell Bob that my worst nightmare was going to a meeting at which all the
                    others rose up and accused me of being an impostor, claiming that I was really a
                    housewife and that I belonged in the kitchen and not in a State Department
                    meeting room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure than any of us have not sat at a conference
                        table and wondered what we were doing there. I have wondered from time to
                        time if I would be exposed at these meetings for my lack of knowledge on the
                        subject under discussion. How long were you in IO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was there from the fall of 1974 to July 1976. With time, I did learn
                    the ropes and had a most enjoyable experience. The issues were interesting. I
                    wrote a lot of speeches or statements delivered by our various representatives
                    in New York at the UN. This was a new challenge and I found that kind of writing
                    pretty difficult. These were position statements that we would deliver in a
                    committee or sometimes they would be drafts tabled at the Security Council. I
                    would take a crack at the first draft, then it would be passed on up the line,
                    getting clearances from all interested parties. Most of the speeches dealt with
                    sensitive Middle East issues, so the clearance process took forever. Our
                    delegates in New York would be screaming for the texts but that didn't help to
                    speed up the clearances. I just had to learn to live with the process and start
                    early.</p>
                <p>Q: In the 1974-76 period, who was our ambassador at the UN? Who was the head of
                    IO and how were the relationships between the two principals and their
                    entities?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bill Buffum was the head of IO, as I mentioned earlier. The senior deputy
                    was Bob Blake whom we had known from Bob's earlier work in New York and Paris,
                    where Blake had been DCM. We lived across the street from each other and our
                    children played together often. So the Blakes were very good friends - Bob Blake
                    was very energetic, positive, and helpful and I enjoyed working for him. I
                    remember taking cables in to him for clearance late in the afternoon to get
                    final approval and his having time for some visiting. We have remained close
                    friends with the Blakes.</p>
                <p>The first NEA Assistant Secretary I worked with was Joe Sisco. When he became
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs [P], he was succeeded by Roy Atherton. As
                    I suggested, I knew most of these people because Bob was working with them
                    continually. Joe, Roy and Bob Oakley became veterans of Kissinger's “shuttle
                    diplomacy.” So my relationships with NEA were easy; I could discuss some of my
                    issues with them during evening social occasions.</p>
                <p>The first UN ambassador was John Scali who was succeeded by Pat Moynihan and then
                    Bill Scranton. At one point, I was instructed to go upstairs to be the note
                    taker in a meeting between Kissinger and Scranton. In those days, junior
                    officers took their notepads into such meetings and had to submit a MEMCOM
                    (memorandum of conversation) as close to verbatim as possible. I remember coming
                    home that evening and sitting at the kitchen table, writing up the MEMCOM;
                    fortunately, it passed muster. Note-taking for the Secretary became another step
                    in my career.</p>
                <p>It was fun for me to be back in the Department, seeing people whom we had known
                    from previous assignments. I would often meet friends for lunch and very good
                    discussions. I began to feel more confident about my work and status. In the
                    summer of 1976, Joe Sisco retired and was succeeded by Phil Habib as Under
                    Secretary of State for Political Affairs. This was during presidential campaign
                    time, which ended in the Carter victory in November. Dan O'Donahue became Phil's
                    chief of staff. Dan and I had known each other for a long time as he had come
                    into the Service with Bob. His first task was to pull a staff together for
                    Habib. He called to ask whether I would like to take the job of Habib's staff
                    assistant on the Middle East. He warned me that there were no guarantees on how
                    long the job would last because he didn't know what the outcome of the elections
                    might be and what impact those elections might have on Habib's status and staff.
                    Nevertheless, after talking to Bob and many others, I agreed to accept the
                    offer. It sounded interesting, a step up, was in Washington, and I didn't have
                    any other better options on the horizon. So by the end of July, I moved to the
                    office of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>Q; Before we move on to this new experience, let me ask a few questions about the
                    1974-76 period. Was your focus during this period on the Arab-Israel conflict or
                    were there other matters of interest to IO?</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Essentially, yes. As I said, I was handling Middle East political
                    questions that arose at the UN and in the specialized agencies. The one agency
                    with which I did not deal was UNRRWA, but I did backstop on it. I handled issues
                    which touched on the functions of the old UN Observer Mission that had been
                    created in 1948 and stationed in Jerusalem. UNSOM, as it was known, worked on
                    issues left over from the 1948 truce agreement. Other groups I worked with were
                    the observer mission on the Golan Heights as well as the team which was
                    established to supervise the arrangements included in the Israeli-Egyptian Sinai
                    disengagement agreement. All of these observer groups had different missions,
                    different compositions - all very complicated. So I had to master what each
                    group was all about and what they were supposed to be doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that by this time protocols and precedents had
                        been established which made every minute change a major issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right. All sides were continually testing the boundaries of the
                    agreements. I can remember one issue that arose while UNRRWA was still
                    headquartered in Beirut. At that juncture, we did not recognize the PLO or any
                    other Palestinian representative. The DCM in Beirut, an old friend, called UNP
                    with an immediate problem for which he needed instructions. The issue was what
                    the U.S. delegation should do if Palestinian representatives were allowed to
                    attend some UNRRWA meetings. He was surprised to hear my voice at the other end
                    of the phone; he had known me as a “wife” and said, “Phyllis, is that you in the
                    chair?” I assured him that it was indeed the very same person, and I told how I
                    had come to this job in IO. I said the instructions were that we could not
                    attend meetings where there were Palestinian representatives, but that at the
                    same time we did not want to leave the organization. Finally, just off the top
                    of my head, I suggested that if and when the Palestinians entered the room, he
                    leave the room, but also leave his coat on the chair that he had occupied so
                    they would know he was coming back. The DCM thought that was brilliant;
                    furthermore there were no other very good alternatives. And that is the way it
                    worked out.</p>
                <p>There was another difficult issue when a large civil aviation meeting (ICAO) took
                    place in Seattle. The issues kept narrowing and becoming more difficult - our
                    delegation kept calling to find out what positions to take. Often, they would
                    tell me that the meeting was starting in five minutes and ask what were they
                    supposed to do. I had to focus and come up with some strategy. There wasn't time
                    for prolonged consultations or clearances, so I would tell the caller what I
                    though he ought to do. I told him that I would inform the appropriate office
                    directors and deputies, but that unless he heard from us, he should proceed as I
                    had suggested. That was just the nature of my responsibilities. Sometimes I had
                    to run through the halls to get some clearance or other. I wished for
                    rollerskates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time when Zionism was equated with racism.
                        Did you run into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes, indeed. We defeated those at the UN who were trying to put through a
                    resolution making that connection. Our office (UNP) sent demarches around the
                    world seeking support for our position. I was the drafting officer on all those
                    messages. In those days, we didn't have word processors, so the editing by all
                    concerned and retyping was a laborious and time-consuming task. And the final
                    copy had to be perfect so that all the carbons could be used as permanent
                    records. The physical process just took forever and was complicated.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of issues and time pressures to contend with. As I mentioned, I
                    used to speak to a variety of groups. In addition, I would get loads of
                    telephone inquiries. There were a lot of Jewish groups that were suspicions
                    about the State Department. I am still amazed how far we have come; we now even
                    have had a Jewish vice presidential candidate. I used to get calls regularly
                    from one woman who I always felt was testing me. She would launch into a speech
                    about how she opposed Israel and then she would say that she thought that our
                    policy was wrong. Then she would ask whether I agreed with her. I would answer
                    her by saying that I was a civil servant and only carrying out the will and
                    orders of the president. I would explain to her what the U.S. stood for and what
                    our policy was and what we were doing. She would then say that she thought that
                    it was wrong and ask the usual question of whether I disagreed with her. I would
                    patiently explain to her what our policy was and why it was. She would then say
                    that she wanted the policy changed; I would suggest to her that that was what
                    the ballot box was for. But I always felt that she was just checking on me to
                    make sure that I was a devoted follower of the president's policy. She may well
                    have been recording our conversations so that if I had made one little slip she
                    could then have said, “See, you can't trust that State Department! It is just
                    filled with anti-Zionists and anti-Semitics!”</p>
                <p>I spent enormous amounts of time with this woman, always concluding that if she
                    wanted the policy changed, she would have to go to the ballot box to register
                    her opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any anti-Israeli or pro-Israeli groups within
                        the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: No. I always felt that there were many people who believed that we were
                    not treating the Arabs fairly and that, for domestic political reasons, the
                    administration was giving too much support to Israel. There were some who felt
                    that what the Israelis were doing to the Palestinians was not morally right. But
                    I think everybody agreed that the peace process was the right approach to
                    resolve the conflict. It would undoubtedly take time and every step would be
                    arduous, but it was important to keep at it if we were to reach our goals of a
                    peaceful settlement. We are now talking about the period following the 1973 war,
                    when disengagement agreements were being worked out one at a time, and the
                    crowning achievement of Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. So progress was being made
                    and has continued in fits and starts; today we are discussing the future of
                    Jerusalem and refugees and water distribution, etc, or at least we were until
                    the latest Intifada. We are even talking about the creation of a Palestinian
                    state. There has not been a major war since 1973, although Palestine is not yet
                    established and at peace. I think that for most Americans and most people in the
                    Middle East, the thought of returning to all out international war is just
                    beyond imagination. There has been a commitment to negotiations. Arafat and
                    Barak were not threatening conflict; they were negotiating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the “Watergate” scandal and the presidential
                        succession effect your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think Ford deserves a great deal of credit for taking over and
                    preserving stability in the midst of a domestic crisis, period. He was familiar
                    with government from his long service on the Hill. He had good judgement, that
                    has been confirmed over time, and was a very decent man. Henry Kissinger
                    continued to run foreign policy. So I didn't see any major changes in our
                    policies and positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was IO's view of Kissinger? Was he seen as neglecting
                        the UN or did he seem to have accepted it as a focal point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think he used the UN to our advantage. I don't think strengthening the
                    United Nations was at the top of his agenda, but he was careful about it. He
                    seemed to run a good State Department. He was a good manager; he kept his hands
                    on lots of issues and would comment on most of the papers that were sent to him.
                    They would be sent back to the drafter who then had a better feel of what the
                    secretary had in mind. By this time, he knew how the bureaucracy worked -
                    whether he had to get presidential approval of a certain decision or whether he
                    could work things out with Congress. The State Department, in this era, seemed
                    to have enough money to manage what needed to be done. Not only was Kissinger
                    handling the Middle East, but was also deeply involved in all Cold War issues
                    such as relations with the Soviet Union, and with China. He was a very, very
                    busy man. He had to handle the oil crisis of 1973. He managed all of these
                    difficult issues and was able to seize opportunities when they were presented.
                    In retrospect, I think the continuity of U.S. foreign policy during a
                    presidential crisis and transition was remarkable, and that certainly was due to
                    Kissinger's abilities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved very much in Soviet issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was not a focus for me. In any case, my hands were more than full with
                    the Middle East. But we always had to be wary lest the Soviet Union try to
                    outflank us and use our support of Israel against us. The Soviets were very
                    active diplomatically and we had to watch carefully what they were doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about some of the positions our allies,
                        like the French, were taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Of course, but it was not a major consideration. This was a very
                    different period in the Cold War. The Atlantic Alliance was much stronger; it
                    held together well because of the common enemy. There may have been some
                    differences in views, but in the mid-'70s the unity of the alliance was clear.
                    That may have changed toward the end of the decade when we ran into major
                    difficulties in Iran, but during the period we are discussing, we were very
                    close to our European allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that in the mid-'70s, the NEA bureau was very
                        much in lock-step with IO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely. I had very close working relationships with that bureau,
                    particularly with those offices involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict. One of
                    the NEA officers told me one day that he thought that he spent more time with me
                    than my husband did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If nothing else, Israeli-Arab tensions proved to be a
                        great training ground for U.S. diplomats and certainly fostered cooperation
                        within the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I would like to make a further observation about this period. As I was
                    reentering the Foreign Service and learning a new trade, a new organization, new
                    processes, etc., my husband undertook a very demanding job, as part of the
                    “shuttle diplomacy” team. So he was gone much of the time. Our daughter was
                    starting high school at National Cathedral School and our son, who after one
                    year in public school, was starting at the Edmund Burke School. He was in his
                    early teens, which is a challenging age for any parent. For our first year in
                    Washington, we rented a house; then we bought a house that needed some
                    renovation. We moved into it in the fall of 1975. So I was stretched very
                    tightly - between the office and home responsibilities. I had to tell people
                    that I just had to go home because the movers were coming or the housekeeper was
                    sick or I needed some days off to take care of the home front. This was very
                    hard because I was needed in the office. Sometimes Bob would take a day off when
                    he could, but he never felt the same pull of responsibility to home. Most men in
                    that age didn't - most of it fell to women. We both would have to go into the
                    office on Saturdays and generally it was a very difficult period with great
                    overload.</p>
                <p>I used to say that I had two teenage children, a new job, a house, a dog and a
                    husband in that order. I did have a housekeeper, but she couldn't do everything.
                    Those first two years were just plain hard. Bob and I would drop the children at
                    school and then go to our offices. I would take the bus home so I could be there
                    when the housekeeper left. I would then finish preparing dinner and feed the
                    children. Bob often would come home late and grab something to eat, and then we
                    would work with the children on their homework. As I said, this was a very, very
                    difficult period. I had a lot to manage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine! You said that in 1976, you moved to the
                        office of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. This was an election
                        year, so that you really didn't know how long you would have that job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was a great unknown. We didn't know who would win the election in the
                    fall of 1976. It was clear on the 7th floor that people just assumed that I was
                    available for twelve to fourteen hours each day, and one weekend day. I found it
                    easier to be home on Saturday and at the office on Sunday. Bob was on a similar
                    schedule. Finally, I said that regardless of how the election turned out, I
                    could not maintain the schedule that was expected of me. As we all know, Carter
                    won the election and appointed Vance as Secretary of State. Habib continued as
                    Under Secretary. After the election, Bob left the NSC and went to work as one of
                    Dick Holbrooke's deputies in the EAP bureau. There were some mutterings about my
                    working for the Under Secretary when my husband was in a senior position in EA;
                    some thought this was a potential problem. It was clear to me that Bob would
                    continue to have a very busy schedule and I just couldn't continue to spend as
                    much time in the “P” office as was expected.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I found out later - I didn't know this when I accepted the appointment - that I
                    was the first female staff aide on the seventh floor. Until my arrival, it had
                    been an all-male preserve; the aide positions had always been reserved for young
                    males - officers who were real “comers.” So I told O'Donahue that it was just
                    impossible for me to continue on the kind of schedule that I had been working. A
                    friend of ours, Bill Luers, who was working in the Latin America bureau, had an
                    opening in the office dealing with public and congressional affairs. So in
                    February, 1977 I moved to that office, which had more regular and shorter hours
                    and it made life considerably more bearable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back to your experience in working for Habib,
                        who is known as one of the great Foreign Service officers of all times. How
                        did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We had known Phil Habib because Bob had worked for him in Vietnam. Bob
                    was always one of “Phil's boys.” As I said, I think Habib took me at O'Donahue's
                    strong recommendation. I didn't know Habib all that well. Occasionally, I would
                    go into his office on a Sunday morning to give him his paperwork and brief him
                    on hot items in the cable traffic. He would then ask why I wasn't home taking
                    care of my husband and children! Today, that would be unheard of, but in the
                    1970s, it was still an acceptable question for Phil Habib. Furthermore, Phil had
                    a secretary who was an “old timer,” very protective of her boss; she didn't want
                    staff aides around; she wanted to take care of the boss all by herself. She was
                    a real gate-keeper. She took a particular dislike to me, probably because I was
                    another woman who was encroaching on her territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us a feeling for what it was like to be the
                        Under Secretary for Political Affairs, which is the most senior job for a
                        Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Phil Habib's Foreign Service experience had been essentially in Asia. He
                    had been our ambassador in Korea and had worked many years on Vietnam. He didn't
                    really know that much about the Middle East and, frankly, he was not that
                    interesteI was supposed to keep things moving. Occasionally, I would catch
                    mistakes in papers that were sent to the seventh floor; I would send them back
                    to the originating office. I knew the NEA leadership trusted me to catch those
                    errors and to work out new language with the drafting officer. But the Middle
                    East was not Habib's priority; he focused on Asia, and on such questions as
                    Vietnam and the Korean DMZ “tree cutting”incident - when some North Koreans
                    attacked a platoon of American and South Korean soldiers who were trying to trim
                    a tree that the North Koreans had deemed as “sacred.” In the scuffle, two
                    American officers were beaten to death. This occurred in the summer of 1976. It
                    was a very tense moment and Habib gave complete attention to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Remember, we were also in the midst of a presidential election. It was therefore
                    not a period of great foreign affairs activity; there were no new initiatives.
                    It was essential, however, that the U.S. government keep things on an even keel
                    with no major upsets. So we had to follow events around the world closely and,
                    in the meantime, make sure everything was ready. That is basically what I did
                    for six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you or Bob or any of your professional friends have
                        any unease about the possibility of a Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: To a certain extent, there was some unease. I think there is always the
                    fear of the unknown. Once the election had taken place and Cyrus Vance nominated
                    to be Secretary of State, the unease abated to great extent because he was a
                    known quantity because of his work at the Vietnam peace talks. Many people in
                    EAP knew him; Habib certainly knew him. Vance also had worked in the Pentagon on
                    some special studies and was therefore known to some Foreign Service officers.
                    Everyone felt that he was a fine man and a very good choice. I think there was
                    probably greater concern about Brzezinski's appointment as the NSC advisor and
                    how the State-NSC relationship would work.</p>
                <p>But I never felt that there would be any major changes in our basic foreign
                    policy. What changes might take place, I thought, would be at the margins and
                    not in our fundamental strategy or goals. I think most apprehension among
                    professionals came from Carter's strong position on human rights. We didn't know
                    what this stance would mean for our relationships with a number of our allies as
                    well as what impact this new emphasis might have on existing policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It took a while for us to adjust to this new view. As
                        Habib's Middle East expert, did you ever hear him take a “plague on both of
                        your houses” attitude towards the Israelis and the Arabs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was some of that. But as I said, the Middle East was not his major
                    interest. Being of Lebanese ancestry, he had studiously avoided the Middle East
                    and he relied on Roy Atherton, the Assistant Secretary, to handle problems in
                    that area. There had been some forward progress with disengagement agreements,
                    and the area was relatively calm. The NEA bureau continued to work on the peace
                    process and Habib saw no reason to get intimately involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to the Latin American bureau. Entirely
                        foreign?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Essentially, although I had been to Mexico once as a tourist! But this
                    was the kind of job I needed and it was a relatively calm period. Bill Luers
                    thought something positive could be done in the public relations field and there
                    could be more public outreach. ARA did not have the front burner issues and
                    importance that it did in other times, nor were its issues of primary importance
                    to the seventh floor. So work pressures were considerably easier than those I
                    faced in IO or in the Under Secretary's office.</p>
                <p>The major issue that was about to confront the bureau was the Panama Canal Treaty
                    and the return of the Canal to Panama. The U.S. was in the process of
                    negotiating a treaty and President Carter was determined to push the treaty to a
                    successful conclusion - the key to that was gaining support for it from the
                    American public. The administration felt that it had to go out to sell the
                    treaty to Americans. It was a period when the proponents had to engage in public
                    debates; congressmen and their staffs were calling for speakers to go to their
                    districts and there was a considerable surge of interest. So within ARA, a cadre
                    of speakers was chosen who would be available to speak in public forums on the
                    Panama Canal Treaty. We, from ARA and outside the bureau, were trained for two
                    days, not only on the substance of the issues and answers to various criticisms,
                    but also on debating techniques and effective public speaking.</p>
                <p>Negotiations for the treaty were concluded by mid-1977 and in the fall I hit the
                    road. I spent a lot of time on college campuses in “centrals” - Pennsylvania,
                    Michigan, Oregon, and South Dakota (that was in January when the temperature was
                    -14 [degrees Fahrenheit])! I must say that I got very good use of all the
                    techniques I learned in that two-day training course and I did my homework. I
                    thoroughly enjoyed the public speaking opportunities. Usually, an opponent of
                    the treaty would open the debate and get bogged down in history before the turn
                    of the century. In such a case I knew that my pitch was going to be heard
                    favorably because opponents of the treaty had tied themselves into an era that
                    had past a long, long time ago and which most audiences found interesting, but
                    not necessarily relevant. Most Americans were interested in the future and how
                    we could manage our relationship with Panama in order to have free and
                    unencumbered access to the canal. There was more interest in the next
                    twenty-five years - the transition period - than what had happened in the 19th
                    century. Most of the public was well aware of the world's experience with the
                    Suez Canal after the Egyptians took control. Passage through the Suez continued
                    unimpeded despite the expropriation, except for the '67 war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess we can all remember when we were told by the
                        British that catastrophe was just around the corner with the Egyptian pilots
                        undoubtedly managing to sink ships and blocking the Canal. In fact, the
                        Canal was only blocked during a war; otherwise the transit proceeded
                        unimpeded. You must have used that precedent as an argument for the
                        treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Of course. There were many other illustrations. I also pointed out that
                    our soldiers would continue to be stationed in Panama for the next twenty-five
                    years and they needed the protection of the Panamanian government. The most
                    tempestuous debate took place near Hagerstown, Maryland, on a small college
                    campus. The meeting was attended by some “rednecks” who kept talking about the
                    dastardly deeds the Soviets were allegedly perpetrating on the world and how the
                    surrender of the Panama Canal would put our security in great jeopardy. When
                    asked what country was really being threatened by the Soviets, one of these
                    speakers could only say that he could not remember, much to the audience's
                    amusement, but he remained convinced that the treaty would spell the end for the
                    U.S. In general, I had a ball giving speeches and participating in debates on
                    the Panama Canal treaty around the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the opposition to the treaty come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Mainly from older people, who kept talking about legalisms, but were in
                    fact afraid of change in the world order. They were concerned about how the
                    United States would manage this change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any reservations about the treaty expressed by
                        any of your colleagues? Panama was after all a different situation than
                        Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was some unease, mostly revolving around the history of the Canal
                    and the legality of the treaty. Even in the late 1970s, people were hesitant
                    about making the argument that the Panamanians could not run the Canal. In the
                    first place, it sounded racist and condescending and furthermore there would be
                    a period of twenty-five years during which we could train the new operators.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was assigned to the ARA regional office, which covered, as I mentioned,
                    regional issues such as drugs and nuclear issues and public and congressional
                    affairs. During the first period of my assignment, I spent most of my time on
                    the Panama Canal treaty. Then the bureau was reorganized. Our shop was folded
                    into the policy planning office, under Luigi Einaudi, and I continued to work on
                    congressional and public affairs. Besides the Panama Canal, there were always
                    issues with Mexico. Sometime in 1978 or early 1979, President Carter became
                    concerned by the increasing waves of legal and illegal immigrants from Mexico.
                    He decided that he was going to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the solution
                    to illegal immigration was worst than the problem. There were jobs for them in
                    the U.S., particularly in the south-west and California, but efforts to legalize
                    their status in this country ran into all sorts of opposition and no one wanted
                    to raise the immigration quota. In the end, we didn't make any progress, but it
                    was a good illustration of how Carter operated. If he saw a problem, he wanted
                    to solve it. But the issue of immigration from Mexico involved so many parties -
                    states, labor unions, existing laws, and bureaucracies - each with its own
                    position, that Mexican immigration was one of the most difficult knots to untie.
                    The lesson I learned was that in trying to move from one point to another on an
                    issue such as this, the process is very important because if used correctly it
                    could move a bureaucracy or an interest group along by educating them. It is
                    time consuming, but necessary if the goal is to be achieved.</p>
                <p>I did get to go to Mexico for a few days to attend a meeting of one of the
                    working groups. Mexicans, of course, viewed our policy as a fence to keep them
                    out of the U.S. In the end, there was no progress on the issue despite all our
                    efforts. The solution was just too complicated and the problem of illegal
                    immigrants continues to this day. The only outcome was the establishment of a
                    bilateral commission, with broad interagency representation, which then became
                    the focus for addressing various immigration issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impact did the Carter administration's emphasis on
                        human rights have on your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It sort of made us unsure of what we should be doing. We had a very
                    serious problem in Chile, but that issue was debated at levels far above
                    mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are referring to the overthrown of Allende and the
                        assumption of power by Pinochet and the military. Those events brought a
                        major backlash in the U.S.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right, but for me personally those events had very little impact. They,
                    and our policy reaction, were handled at the assistant secretary level and I was
                    not involved.</p>
                <p>I found the ARA job quite interesting and rewarding although with an uneven work
                    load. There would be periods of intense activity followed by more relaxed, even
                    dull, periods.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>By mid-1979, I was preparing for my next assignment. Bob had been asked to become
                    ambassador to Zaire. Harry Barnes was the Director General of the Foreign
                    Service at the time and he worked out an arrangement that permitted me to work
                    in the embassy in Kinshasa; this was a new personnel approach and I was the test
                    case. I would be the first ambassador's spouse to be allowed to work in his or
                    her spouse's embassy. The concern that had existed about potential nepotism was
                    set aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ARA, I think, has the reputation in the Foreign Service of
                        being a nice assignment, but not central to American foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was an area in which I had never taken much interest, and I spoke no
                    Spanish. It is true that Latin America was not as central to my background as
                    was the Middle East or Africa, but I was interested in learning more about it.
                    From that point of view, it was a very good tour because I did learn a lot about
                    the region and I enjoyed my two years in the bureau. The debate about the Panama
                    Canal treaty was a unique experience - one that I could probably not have
                    duplicated in any other assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the professionals' reaction to Carter's confidence in his ability to
                    settle the Canal issue?</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Many said, “Lots of luck” and were extremely dubious that he could do it
                    but I think most people in the bureau felt it was the right thing to do. Carter
                    drove the pace of negotiations and the selling of the treaty to the American
                    public. He wanted it signed, sealed, and delivered or approved by the Senate
                    where he had the votes; he felt that he needed to abide by a strict timetable
                    given the considerable opposition in the country to his policy. I think there
                    was probably more grumbling in the bureau about the pace than there was about
                    the goal. As I said, I think everyone in ARA felt it was the right policy to
                    follow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many contacts on the Hill while working on
                        the selling of the treaty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: The administration's input in the Senate debate on the treaty was handled
                    at a very high level. Gale McGee, a former senator, was employed to manage the
                    administration's efforts. Carter himself was deeply involved as was his close
                    staff. I think that they figured they had just enough votes to pass the treaty.
                    Frank Church, who was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was a
                    strong proponent.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>J. Bennett Johnston was the junior senator from Louisiana and a childhood friend
                    of Bob's. I went to sit with his wife in the balcony on the day the treaty was
                    ratified. I thought it would be a momentous occasion and I watched as each
                    senator voted. Of course, by this time, everyone knew that passage was assured
                    so it was somewhat anti-climactic. Nevertheless, it was a very interesting
                    historical moment.</p>
                <p>Passage of the main treaty was followed by implementing arrangements. There were
                    a myriad of detailed matters that had to be resolved and approved by both sides.
                    That took a lot of work and ARA was involved in drafting legislation for such
                    matters as the military transition. These issues were left for resolution
                    essentially to the staff with only limited engagement of the seventh floor and
                    the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What debating tricks did you use? Did you find that in,
                        for example, debates on college campuses, it was the more senior citizens
                        that had reservations rather than the students or the faculty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I used a lot of quotes during the debates as well as a lot of jokes. I
                    think we were effective with students and faculty members. But audiences were
                    unpredictable; opposition might arise anywhere. I already mentioned difficulties
                    I had in central Maryland, but they could arise in Pennsylvania, or central
                    Michigan or South Dakota. It was a fact that people in central, more rural areas
                    were more conservative than ones found in urban and other parts of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into any residue of bitterness from the
                        Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not particularly, which I found interesting. I think the nation's
                    sentiments about Vietnam were still somewhat fluid; it would take a few more
                    years before they began to jell and set. I suspect that there might have been
                    more reluctance about giving something else up or taking on another major
                    foreign policy issue if the Panama Canal issue had come up in the early '70s.
                    But the debates in 1977 did not really touch on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run into a situation in which you, as a
                        “servant of the people” had to take on a “representative of the
                        people?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: No. We were debating in forums set up by congressmen, but I can't
                    remember one being there. Our goal was to explain carefully and repeatedly that
                    the use of the Canal was what was important and not the ownership. The U.S. was
                    interested in its use; the Canal had been important to us at various stages in
                    our history and we wanted to be able to rely on its unrestricted use in the
                    future. The argument was that our use would be much less subject to harassment
                    or interference if we traveled through it in cooperation with the Panamanians
                    rather than in opposition. The treaties were the best vehicle available to meet
                    our goals; they allowed for discussion of all navigation issues. Furthermore, as
                    the treaty was submitted to the Senate, there was an open and full discussion of
                    policy. Senate approval would be followed by a twenty-five year transition
                    period during which any unforeseen problems could be resolved. On the other
                    hand, our refusal to turn the Canal over might just mean its complete loss to
                    the United States through some kind of coup or military action or sabotage.</p>
                <p>I should conclude this chapter by saying that I liked my ARA assignment; I was
                    very thankful to Bill Luers for the job he offered me, but I really did feel
                    that since I had no background in the area I was always viewed as an outsideI
                    was not quite a member of the “club” which was not the situation in AF or NEA. I
                    think it is true that you earn your stripes by working in an area; I had not,
                    nor did I speak Spanish, so that I really was not a member of the ARA club. I
                    think that in some ways the ARA club was probably more closed and tight than
                    some of the others in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1979, you went to Zaire as the wife of the ambassador
                        and as a member of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right. We looked forward to the assignment; the continent was familiar
                    and we were ready to go overseas. Bob had the excitement of his first
                    ambassadorial assignment. Our daughter by this time was in college and our son
                    was a sophomore in boarding school. So they were pretty close to becoming
                    independent and didn't need our constant attention.</p>
                <p>Bob left around Thanksgiving, 1979. I was left behind to pack up, redo the
                    kitchen and make other renovations before renters moved in, and finish my
                    assignment. I waited for the children to come home for Christmas vacation and
                    then the three of us left for Zaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Before leaving, I looked for possible assignments in the embassy in Kinshasa. Bob
                    and I agreed that the job should not be too close to the front office. There was
                    an opening with USIA as an assistant cultural affairs officer. USIA still had a
                    big program in Zaire; you will remember we had some very large embassies in
                    Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. USIA was not housed in the chancery so there was
                    a physical separation from the embassy. USIS seemed delighted that I was
                    interested in working for them and USIA people in Washington were very willing
                    to go along with this new experiment of dual assignments, particularly since
                    they were having trouble filling their slots in Zaire. Bob and I thought it was
                    just the right assignment for me, both as a professional and as the wife of the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a pretty good firewall between what Bob was
                        doing and what you were doing. He didn't have any direct supervisory
                        responsibility and you would be working for an agency other than State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That's right. It all worked out pretty well. As I said, the children and
                    I arrived in Zaire just before Christmas and in time to meet all the staff at
                    holiday parties. The residence was an old, lovely building - probably built in
                    the late 1940s or early 1950s - right on the banks of the Zaire River. When we
                    looked across the river, we saw Congo-Brazzaville. We had a tennis court and
                    swimming pool. It was a very comfortable residence. We were there from late 1979
                    until September 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start by describing the situation in Zaire during
                        your years there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: President Mobutu had been considered one of our close allies for a long
                    time. There was an on going struggle in central Africa against communist
                    expansion, which was particularly acute in Angola. In 1976, the Popular Movement
                    for the Liberation of Angola had organized a Marxist regime with the support of
                    a large contingent of Cuban troops. Zaire had itself gone through some rough
                    moments in the early 1960s after independence, with a Katangan rebellion
                    followed by a government headed by Moise Tshombe who was overthrown by Mobutu in
                    1965. In 1977, there was another rebellion in Katanga (Shaba) Province that was
                    put down by the Kinshasa government with the assistance of the French and a
                    couple of other countries. Shaba was an important province because it was the
                    home of serious mining - copper and cobalt. Zaire had made a lot of money off
                    these minerals that were vital industrial components. When we arrived, the
                    government, using American companies, was finishing a huge power line from a
                    hydroelectric plant on the Zaire River near Kinshasa, the capital, to the
                    southern Shaba province for processing of ore. A lot of the Katangan and Shaban
                    rebels had fled into Angola, and there was still some instability.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>So Mobutu was certainly “our man” and he was supported strongly by the U.S. As I
                    said, Zaire had gone through some very difficult periods. In the mid-1970s, in
                    an economic decline, there had been a number of personal attacks in Kinshasa as
                    Zairians became desperately poor. But this wave was practically over by the time
                    we reached Kinshasa. We in fact were there in a rather tranquil period before
                    another rising wave of Zairian desperation that led to open rebellions in the
                    1980s and 1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mobutu being criticized at this point for corruption
                        and management failures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Mobutu was always corrupt, or had become so very soon become after taking
                    power. He always skimmed off a certain percentage of costs of major transactions
                    or industries. I have heard people say that Mobutu had no concept of economics,
                    and I agreed. He knew nothing - nor cared - about economic predictability or
                    management; he basically ran Zaire as his personal fiefdom. Whatever progress
                    was made was due to his acquiescence or approval; it was not the result of any
                    systematic bureaucratic initiative, or any initiative from the population.
                    Fortunately, Zaire had many assets - ores, oil, electric power, a good
                    transportation system (rail and river), coffee, tea, food products. We knew that
                    if there had been even minimal management and proper stewardship, Zaire was a
                    country that could have grown dramatically in economic terms. Zairians are as
                    artistic, musical, and intelligent a people as I have ever met in Africa. They
                    were absolutely wonderful people, but there was no system to keep universities
                    going or anything else moving in the right direction. There was just a complete
                    absence of overall systematic management, with great corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had what I considered a wonderful job. As I said, I was an assistant
                    cultural affairs officer, in charge of all the scholarship programs. We had had
                    many Fulbright scholars from Zaire who had studied in the U.S. as well as
                    American scholars who had spent a year in Zaire studying such matters as
                    anthropology, sociology, or politics. There were some every year at the
                    University of Lubumbashi as well as the University just outside Kinshasa. We had
                    had exchanges going on for a couple of decades, from the early 1960s when our
                    influence was at its zenith. By 1979, there were many educated Zairians who were
                    very impressive.</p>
                <p>So I worked on those exchanges as well as the international visitors program
                    which sent about 30 Zairians on familiarization trips to the U.S. I worked out
                    programs with them and organized their itineraries. I remember especially one
                    dance tour that was sponsored by the African-American Institute in Washington.
                    That was a wonderful, powerful dance group; it toured in a number of American
                    cities and was well received.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Other staff members worked on press releases and contacts; we had a rather large
                    cultural center. Others worked in the library. I thoroughly enjoyed my job and
                    felt I met the most wonderful Zairians; they were the cultural leaders of the
                    country - university professors, writers, and artists. It was just terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, Zaire is viewed as a completely dysfunctional
                        state. In your days, were there functioning institutions to which these
                        scholars could return?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I believe so. I think most if not all of the people who went to the U.S.
                    were able to use their experiences in a worthwhile way after their return, at
                    least for a certain period, but I must also say that deterioration of Zairian
                    institutions was well under way and was very visible when we were there.
                    Nevertheless universities still functioned; they had visiting scholars and
                    professors. These were obviously hard times, but the essence of the universities
                    still persisted and they were active places of learning.</p>
                <p>The city called Lubumbashi, near the copper mines which brought in a lot of
                    foreign workers and influence, had a good university establishment begun by the
                    Belgians. But the state did not support the system financially - or at least on
                    an appropriate basis. So professors went payless; students had dormitories, but
                    no food. It was the unpredictability of the arrival of promised resources that
                    made management very difficult. We used to select university students for study
                    in the U.S. and the government would promise to pay the schools, but the money
                    would never show up. Of course, someone had absconded with those funds to
                    Belgium or some other haven. The national Department of Education was a
                    catastrophe; it never had any resources.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of Zairians who had been educated in Europe in French speaking
                    countries. They knew what an educational system should look like. They would
                    return to Zaire and speak eloquently of their experiences and aspirations, but
                    there was very little they could do about the problems in their own country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't this a discouraging scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was indeed, but on the other hand, we found Zairians so intelligent
                    and eager to learn that we tried the best we could to help wherever we could.
                    This was particularly true on the personal level. There were a number of
                    organizations that provided assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, which
                    tried to keep the financial system going; there was still a lot of interest in
                    Zaire. There were strategic reasons, as I mentioned earlier, primarily because
                    of the pro-communist regime in Angola. These reasons led us to continue to
                    support Mobutu, particularly after Reagan became president and Jean Kirkpatrick
                    at the United Nations took an interest in Africa; she promulgated the “benign
                    dictatorship” theory that justified our support of people like Mobutu. Bob and
                    others in the embassy kept saying that some standards of acceptable financial
                    conduct had to be set because allowing all corruption to go on unchecked was not
                    doing anyone any favors. In the end, Mobutu complained to the U.S. government,
                    through the CIA, about Bob's attitude and requested that he be recalled. Vernon
                    Walters used to visit Zaire often as the primary interlocutor and the conduit
                    between the CIA and Mobutu. Walters had been the Deputy Director of CIA, our
                    Ambassador to the UN, and spoke many languages fluently, and often undertook
                    assignments such as these. When he came to Kinshasa, he would stay with us.
                    Walters told Mobutu that ambassadors didn't stay at their posts forever and when
                    Bob's tour was up at the end of three years he would be reassigned, but he would
                    not be pulled out. This was the usual Mobutu game and he had PNGed ambassadors
                    before. I think Bob felt that he had an obligation to call a spade a spade; he
                    had to be true to the principals that the U.S. stands for. There were reasons to
                    support Mobutu, but there also had to be some limits. When Carter became
                    president, some accused him of being soft and allowing Angola to keep its
                    communist government without trying to subvert it. But Congress had passed a
                    prohibition on funding the Angola insurgents, the Bolland amendment I believe.
                    In the meantime, Ethiopia had fallen to the communists, followed by Afghanistan
                    that eventually led to a Soviet invasion of that country. All of these events
                    raised some questions about the strength and staying power of the U.S., and that
                    made it seem even more important that we continue to work with people like
                    Mobutu, trying to keep their support, and at the same time trying to reform
                    their regimes so that the large resources which countries like Zaire had would
                    work for the benefit of the masses and not just the few at the top.</p>
                <p>What surprised me was the acquiescence of Zairians to these deplorable
                    conditions. They did not demand any changes; they accepted the corruption and
                    undemocratic regime without rising up. In a country as large as Zaire, one would
                    have thought that some demands for better conditions would have sprung up, even
                    if it had to be done violently. But it didn't happen, in part because Zairians
                    had such bitter memories of the events of the early 1960s after independence
                    when the country was wrecked by civil war between various factions. People were
                    loath to take any action that might bring instability again. Furthermore, there
                    was no starvation; the standard of living may not have been as high as it should
                    have been, but everyone had the basic necessities. There was some commerce, so
                    people did not reach a point of desperation, although when you consider what
                    might have been, it was a very sad situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I wondered why more people didn't leave the country; I didn't understand the
                    attachment of many Zairians to their country, and especially those who had lived
                    in Belgium or another foreign country. I came to the conclusion that large
                    countries with established cultures, family ties, unique patterns of living,
                    including stealing from each other, have a hold on people which keeps them at
                    home and draws those who had left back to the motherland. This attraction seems
                    to be true for Russia, China, Zaire, France, Brazil, and of course the U.S.
                    There is something unique in each of those cultures that holds people and brings
                    them back - “there is no place like home.” Zairians loved Zaire and being
                    Zairian; they just wanted a higher standard of living and greater participation
                    - not a complete lack of corruption, some of which they seemed to accept. I used
                    to say that Mobutu would let a number of people approach the trough, drink its
                    riches, and go away able to live comfortably for a number of years. That group
                    would be followed by others; which made for constant movement in society.</p>
                <p>This was a period in Zaire's history when no one was being killed. Some would be
                    held under house arrest and denied the ability to travel, but it was not a
                    brutal regime. The brutality lay in the poverty that denied people access to
                    adequate housing, food, education, and medical care; people at the bottom of the
                    ladder had no chance to rise; they had no hope for a better future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with the jealousies among the
                        tribes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We certainly had to be aware of tensions among the Zairian tribes or
                    ethnic groups. We had to know what we were doing. Of course, the embassy was
                    trying to assure that international visitor grants covered all the various parts
                    of society - men and women, north and south, east and west, teachers and
                    business people, government and religious leaders. So our programs were fairly
                    balanced.</p>
                <p>I must add that at the time we were in Zaire, there were some mysterious diseases
                    that were beginning to spread. One was a “monkey” fever, which we now know was
                    the beginning of AIDS. We didn't know that then. French and Belgian doctors,
                    people whose forefathers had settled in Zaire, were working in tropical medicine
                    and began to examine these new fevers.</p>
                <p>The Mission Aviation Fellowship flew mail and people to mission stations, in
                    remote areas of the country and sometimes gave us rides. The religious
                    organizations held the fabric of society together. They provided whatever there
                    was of value - religion, medical care, and education - in that society. They
                    showed real and deep concern for people.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>There are a number of trips and visits that stand out in my memory. One had to do
                    with the desire to visit all the American mission stations in Zaire. There were
                    a good number of American missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, who had
                    set up stations and hospitals and schools. Some of their families had come to
                    Zaire at the turn of the century, so that they were second and third generation
                    missionaries and doctors, very dedicated, impressive people. In one area, where
                    it was thought sickle cell anemia had originated and then spread to the U.S., a
                    number of American anthropologists - well known university professors - had come
                    to study. One Yale art historian linked hand gestures made by American
                    cheerleaders to some basic Zairian stances that he had he noticed. Learning from
                    them certainly enriched my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been a long history of tensions between the
                        ambassador and the CIA station. Did you get involved in that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not much, because Bob faced the problem within the first month of his
                    arrival. He told the CIA chief that his and his predecessors' direct access to
                    Mobutu might have worked for other ambassadors, but that was not the way the
                    U.S. mission was going to operate under him. Fortunately, we had friends who
                    were in senior positions in CIA and the Agency backed Bob and diminished the
                    role that CIA had played in Zaire previously. There were attempts, naturally, by
                    station employees to keep their lines open to Mobutu, but Bob squelched them
                    whenever he found out about it, thus raising Mobutu's level of unhappiness with
                    him. But Bob was the ambassador and ran the embassy as he saw fit and not the
                    way Mobutu might have liked it.</p>
                <p>Bob also had some problems with diamond organizations, like deBeers. They wanted
                    to conduct their own foreign policy and had done so in certain circumstances.
                    But those were just facts of life in Zaire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the CIA try to influence the selection of participants
                        in USIA programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely not. They would not have dared.</p>
                <p>At the time we were there, The U.S. still had a big mission in Zaire. We had a
                    consulate in Kivu, where there was a large Peace Corps training center. We had a
                    large military assistance mission that worked with the Zairian military, largely
                    on training. We had a large AID mission that concentrated, to large measure, on
                    PL 480 food programs and on health care. As I said, we had a Peace Corps group.
                    We also housed certain regional experts - e.g. doctors for U.S. personnel - who
                    used Kinshasa as their base. Zaire was larger and had more services than other
                    nearby countries and therefore it was a more satisfactory base.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>In light of the importance of Zaire and its central location, there was a large
                    diplomatic community in Kinshasa. We spent a lot of time with the Canadian
                    ambassador and his wife, who were very active there, and with the French and
                    Belgians, who had the greatest influence in Zaire. The British had
                    representation, but at a lower level than the others. The Germans gave some
                    money to Zaire as did the Japanese, and they were well represented plus there
                    were missions from other African countries. There was also an international
                    business community - Firestone, GM, etc., for the U.S. - but mainly European
                    firms. This was an era when most other African countries still envied Zaire's
                    light industry and infrastructure that had been maintained from its colonial
                    period. So Zaire was an active place. As I said, I met a wonderful group of
                    Zairians and Bob and I were able to travel around the country quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some feeling that Mobutu would be in power for
                        sometime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes, primarily because we and the Europeans were not going to get rid of
                    him, assuming that we could have done so. We could have cut off assistance,
                    particularly cash, but this was a period when the greatest concern was the
                    Soviet Union. The western allies certainly were not interested in having Zaire
                    ally itself with the communist camp. The Chinese were present and were very
                    active and busy trying to increase communist activity and influence. The whole
                    diplomatic thrust was to keep Mobutu on as straight and narrow path as humanly
                    possible - extremely difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1982, you left Zaire and were assigned where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As we neared the end of our three-year assignment, it seemed it was back
                    to Washington for the Oakleys. As we were leaving, Bob did not know what his
                    next assignment would be. Frank Wisner, then the senior deputy in AF, called him
                    and asked whether he would go to Somalia, and Bob agreed. That call was made
                    sometime in September and our ambassador in Mogadishu, Don Peterson, didn't want
                    to leave until January. So there was going to be a gap in Bob's assignment
                    process. That was not a problem; it allowed us to settle back in and permitted
                    me to find a job. I had decided that I would not go to Somalia because a) there
                    wasn't a job for me there; b) I had been on loan to USIA for three years and I
                    was anxious to return to political work; and c) at this point our son was in
                    college and our daughter was in graduate school (Bank Street College of
                    Education in New York), but they did not have a home base on the East Coast to
                    return to during vacations and between terms. We found it very difficult in
                    Zaire to stay in touch with our children and our families. Our son was a George
                    W. Bush type - involved in much social activity. Once, while in Florida for
                    spring vacation, he lost his wallet or it was stolen from him and he called his
                    grandmother who, understandably, found it difficult to deal with such an
                    emergency. So we decided that I would stay in Washington and Bob would go to
                    Somalia. It was not an ideal solution, but we felt that we had to do it at least
                    for a short period of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>When we left Zaire, we traveled a little on the way home - we visited the Harrops
                    in Kenya and the Athertons in Cairo and then flew to Washington. I had a little
                    time before starting my next job in October that I spent moving back into our
                    old house, completing small renovations as we settled back in. We got our
                    daughter off to New York and our son off to his college; everything worked out
                    fine. Bob went to FSI to study Italian before going off to Somalia.</p>
                <p>I had applied for a job in the NEA bureau as the Afghanistan desk officer. The
                    Soviets had invaded the country a couple of years earlier (December, 1979) and
                    were in control in Kabul. We still had a small embassy there, headed by a charg�
                    d'affaires. Of course everyone knew that we were supplying arms to the
                    mujahadeen - the Afghan rebels, who were trying to throw the Soviets out. So
                    when I became desk officer, I found myself involved in a very interesting and
                    demanding task. I worked in NEA/PAB, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh,
                    which was headed by Harmon Kirby. I worked closely with a number of younger
                    officers, who were assigned to the Pakistan and Bangladesh desks and had a very
                    good time.</p>
                <p>I felt that I had four main responsibilities: first of all, to support our charge
                    and his staff in Kabul. When I started, the charge was Charles Dunbar; he was
                    followed in 1983 by Ed Hurwitz. Both spoke Farsi or Dari, as the Afghans called
                    it, and therefore could function effectively. I think assignments to Kabul in
                    this period must have been quite interesting, reporting on what the Soviets were
                    doing, what their attitudes and operations were, and what Afghan attitudes were.
                    The second part of the job was to work with all of the Afghan support groups in
                    the U.S., of which there were several. In retrospect, I am sure that the CIA
                    supported some of these groups in their overseas work, particularly when the
                    Soviets were charged with the use of chemical weapons and with egregious gassing
                    of Afghans in covered irrigation tunnels. There were a number of charges of
                    “foul play” against the Soviets in the 1982-83 period. These followed the
                    “Yellow Rain” incidents that had taken place in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From where were we getting our information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Primarily from our mission in Kabul. It was, of course, limited in its
                    coverage because it was almost impossible to travel outside the capital. We also
                    got information from Peshawar, Pakistan where our consulate had been beefed up.
                    There were lots of Afghans who crossed the border with Pakistan and talked to
                    the various resistance groups who were either headquartered or had
                    representation in Peshawar. There was also a considerable amount of news
                    reporting; there were a number of intrepid corespondents who would accompany the
                    mujahadeen, take pictures, and record their adventures. It was kind of “trial by
                    fire” for many of them because they thought they had to enter Afghanistan to
                    “earn their journalistic spurs.”</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I worked with a number of NGO relief organizations that had representation in
                    Afghanistan. Among these was “Doctors without Borders,” a French group that was
                    doing relief work in Afghanistan. There was a serious effort being made to try
                    to support the mujahadeen, who were primarily in the eastern part of the
                    country, so that they could continue their resistance.</p>
                <p>One of the major responsibilities I faced was the issue of Afghans in the U.S.
                    requesting political asylum. I had to review and approve these requests. The
                    Human Rights Bureau did the basic work on these cases, passing on the
                    applications from INS and as I said, I would pass judgement on the bone fides of
                    the petition. Of course, all of these Afghans wanted to come to speak to me. I
                    found it tedious to go through the paperwork; I found my contacts with the
                    asylees and refugees much more interesting and enjoyable. Most of the applicants
                    came from the educated class, who had been brought to the U.S. by an active
                    refugee resettlement program that was based in Pakistan. The Vietnamese program
                    was used as a model. It was interesting that the Germans probably accepted more
                    Afghan refugees than we did. They also choose many of the educated Afghans;
                    there had been a German high school in Kabul and other outreach programs that
                    made migration into Germany a logical consequence. We worked closely with a lot
                    of the German-sponsored refugee groups.</p>
                <p>Various conferences were organized in Europe to call attention to the allegations
                    of chemical weapons use by the Soviets. This effort had an effect. I think one
                    could debate whether the Soviets were using any such weapons after the beginning
                    of the invasion. As time passed, I think it became evident that some chemical
                    agents were being used for crowd control but that practice died down after the
                    issue became one of international debate. I suspect they began to realize how
                    dangerous the use of such weapons was for their own people in Afghanistan.
                    Furthermore, I think the Soviets realized that they didn't have to use such
                    weapons; the bad publicity they were receiving was just not worth the trouble. I
                    think that they stopped using these agents or weapons after late 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern at the time about the mujahadeen's
                        fundamentalism and the potential that had for the longer run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not really. At this time there were six major resistance groups -
                    Gulbaddin Hekmatyar was considered to be the most fundamentalist and the
                    strictest. He also had the most effective fighting group and received a lot of
                    assistance. Hekmatyar is still alive, but he has been eclipsed by the Taliban.
                    But in the early 1980s, he was considered to be the most effective resistance
                    leader.</p>
                <p>In those days, PAB's job was four-fold, trying to keep public attention focused
                    on Afghanistan; trying to take care of our small mission in Kabul; dealing with
                    the Afghan groups in the U.S.; and trying to take care of the refugee and
                    humanitarian problems. I was very busy and really didn't have the time to worry
                    about the longer range potential.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We know that the Afghan issue was of great concern to
                        President Reagan. Were you getting pressure from the NSC? Were you aware of
                        all of our activities in and around Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I knew that there were a number of on-going clandestine activities, but I
                    had no idea about the details. For example, although I knew that we were
                    supporting the mujahadeen and that CIA was somehow involved, I was not aware of
                    the dollar amounts - that was a very tightly held fact. I did not feel that it
                    was my place to probe into those activities.</p>
                <p>Early on, it was clear to me that to keep a resistance movement goinsuch as the
                    one in Afghanistan - three things were required. First, you had to have a native
                    population that was willing to join an armed resistance; there was no substitute
                    for such local involvement. Second, there had to be a safe haven which in this
                    case was Pakistan for the mujahadeen to use as a base of operations (although
                    Pakistan denied providing such a base - “plausible deniability”). Third, there
                    had to be outside assistance, which we were providing, as were China and Saudi
                    Arabia.</p>
                <p>The Afghan resistance movement was always conservative. In its early days, it may
                    not have been fundamentalist, but it was always conservative. I used to laugh
                    about meeting Afghan leaders on my various trips to the region. I knew that most
                    leaders would not shake my hand; that was just something they would not do.
                    There were two leaders who were not Islamic fundamentalists: Mojeddedi and Pir
                    Sailani. They were much more western; both spoke English; they were quite
                    sophisticated and had been well educated, as were their childreThey had
                    relatives in the U.S. who were professionals; e.g. doctors. But they were never
                    able to generate the same kind of support from the Afghan people as some of the
                    other mujahadeen leaders. I think history has taught us that in a resistance
                    movement usually one man rises to the top - such as Tito in Yugoslavia or Ben
                    Bella in Algeria. That did not happen in Afghanistan because the Afghans
                    themselves were so split by tribal loyalties and Pakistan found it could
                    maintain control of the mujahadeen movement more easily if it were divided. By
                    supporting the rivalries, the Pakistanis did not have to contend with one
                    unchallenged Afghan leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pakistani involvement was always part of the equation.
                        They had their own game plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Quite true. At this point, the Pakistani leadership was interested in
                    “strategic depth;” in looking at the threat from India and they felt they needed
                    a pliant Afghanistan behind them to face India's power. If hostilities were to
                    break out with India, Pakistan felt it needed to have Afghanistan fully on its
                    side. The history of Afghan-Pakistan relations is very complicated; the Pushtun
                    tribe dwells in both countries and Pakistan's northwest territories are well
                    known for their “independence.” The Taliban did not exist in the mid-1980s, they
                    came later and sprang up in part from Afghan conservatism - but during the
                    period we are discussing, there wasn't the fanaticism we saw displayed in the
                    mid and late 1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern for Iranian involvement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not really, because Iran was consumed by its war with Iraq. So Iran was
                    not a major player in Afghanistan. There were a large number of Afghans from
                    western Afghanistan who had fled across the border and had settled in eastern
                    Iran. They were being assisted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. But
                    this was not at all comparable to what the Pakistanis were doing for the
                    refugees in the Northwest Frontier Province. There, large refugee camps had been
                    established. Some of these camps were closed to outsiders because they were
                    being used as military training grounds. Camps were set up all over the
                    province, particularly around Peshawar. In 1983, I paid my first visit to
                    Pakistan. I went to Quetta where I saw one of the fantastic ICRC (International
                    Committee for Red Cross) hospitals for war casualties. It was very hot on the
                    day I visited so I wore a short sleeved dress, but I did bring along a shawl to
                    cover my arms. I was standing in the hospital when a young boy was dying, with
                    his father and uncle beside his bed. They asked me to cover my arms, which I
                    rapidly did. The young boy had internal injuries, which the doctors found in
                    most cases to be fatal as it took so long to get to the hospital. I had this
                    feeling that I could not fathom what they had gone through, just as they could
                    not comprehend what I did and why I was there.</p>
                <p>People who had broken limbs or limbs blown off by land mines usually recovered.
                    The ICRC, almost from the beginning of its efforts, established a prosthetic
                    program, fitting people with devices made in India, which although primitive by
                    our standards, were very effective and useful. I will never forget standing
                    outside the facility watching someone learning to ride a bicycle using an
                    artificial foot.</p>
                <p>After Quetta, I went to Islamabad and then on to Peshawar. My first impression as
                    we drove toward Peshawar was that of Afghans walking in thick dust along the
                    roads. The streets teemed with them, all heading for international refugee
                    organizations' headquarters to register and establish themselves. I thought
                    Peshawar was a wonderful old Central Asian city, with an old souk, or market. I
                    thought Afghan faces were as fine, dignified, and interesting, and as delicate
                    as I had ever seen. I stopped in Mogadishu on the way home to see Bob. I really
                    enjoyed that visit; it was a great introduction to the South Asia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a focal point for Afghan policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was, but not at my level! I was the lowly desk officer. Certainly
                    the Deputy Assistant Secretary and the Assistant Secretary were plugged in; they
                    knew what the Agency was doing. But that was not my job. My focus was on the
                    public face we were trying to present to the American public - about the how and
                    why of what we were doing in Afghanistan. I wrote proclamations on the
                    anniversary of the Soviet invasion that were issued by the White House - I wrote
                    various speeches for our UN representatives on what was happening in
                    Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>I will never forget the call I received from Bernie Gwertzman of The New York
                    Times, whom I knew slightly. We discussed Afghanistan in general and then he
                    asked whether it was true that the CIA was spending $100 million per annum on
                    the mujahadeen. I told him that I didn't know the details of such activities! I
                    was dealing with entirely different aspects of our Afghan policy. After the
                    conversation ended, I immediately ran upstairs and told my bosses in the front
                    office that I just had this phone call asking about dollar amounts of CIA
                    support for the Afghan resistance. I reported that I had told Gwertzman that I
                    didn't know anything about it. Later I learned that my report had filtered all
                    the way up to George Shultz; someone then called The New York Times and the
                    story that was printed did not talk of CIA support. In the early 1980s,
                    information about CIA activities was very tightly held and therefore it was
                    nearly impossible for any reporter to get confirmation of what was going on.</p>
                <p>Clearly the Agency, supported by the White House, was the engine that drove our
                    activities in and around Afghanistan. I was the public front for diplomatic
                    efforts for Afghanistan, but that was not were the action really was.
                    Nevertheless, I found it a wonderful job, but extremely demanding. I stayed on
                    it for over 2 � years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I bid for a Pearson Fellowship that would allow me to spend a year
                    working on the Hill for some representative or senator. That was to be followed
                    by an assignment to the Office of Congressional Relations (H) as the Middle East
                    expert.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Fate intervened with all of this. On the fifth anniversary of the Soviet invasion
                    of Afghanistan - December 26 or 27, 1984 - right after Christmas - our office,
                    PAB, was called about a television show. (The Soviets always maintained that
                    they had waited until after Christmas, although I think, in fact, some units may
                    well have moved into Afghanistan just prior and during Christmas celebrations.
                    Most people were actually away on holiday when the invasion started.) We had had
                    some earlier indications that there might be a discussion of Afghanistan on the
                    McNeil-Lehrer PBS television show. By this time Herb Haggerty was the office
                    director; when the invitation to appear came to him, he graciously said that
                    since I had been working on this issue for at least two years, that it was only
                    fitting for me to appear and represent the Department.</p>
                <p>I went on the show with Senator Gordon Humphrey from New Hampshire, who was a
                    fervent supporter of the Afghan cause and on the conservative end of the
                    political spectrum, and Sig Harrison, a journalist who had long been associated
                    with Afghanistan. He took a more conciliatory point of view, supporting peace
                    talks to be chaired by the UN. Naturally, I knew a lot about Afghanistan after
                    two years - what was going on, the political context in the U.S., and in the
                    world. My view, which I expressed at the time and which turned out to be
                    correct, was that there was no way that the mujahadeen could win the war. They
                    would keep the Soviets from solidifying their control of the country, given the
                    strength of the resistance in the eastern part of Afghanistan. It was true that
                    mujahadeen had come pretty close to Kabul at times and did govern part of the
                    northern area of the country. I continued that the issue of control of
                    Afghanistan would not be resolved until other factors in the world played
                    themselves out. And in fact this is what happened with the advent of Gorbachev
                    and his new foreign policy approach, accompanied by the collapse of the Soviet
                    Union, bringing about the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the collapse of the
                    Afghan puppet regime in Kabul finally in 1989. But the mujahadeen did not defeat
                    the Soviets.</p>
                <p>When I appeared on McNeil-Lehrer, George Shultz was on vacation in California and
                    he happened to watch the program. The next day, I had lunch with Herb and upon
                    returning to my office, I was told that the Secretary of State had called. We
                    were somewhat dubious that this had actually happened, but I called Shultz back.
                    I was dumbfounded when I found out that all he wanted to do was to thank me for
                    the good job I had done! That was one of the nicest things that ever happened to
                    me. He later remembered that TV appearance, which changed my career about nine
                    months later.</p>
                <p>Back to world politics, there were a lot of other things that happened during the
                    1985-89 period, but it was really Gorbachev who decided to pull out and end
                    Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He decided it was not worth the cost to his
                    country, including the psychological impact of returning body-bags on the Soviet
                    population.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Q: I have always been puzzled by the Soviet strategy and have been looking for a
                    rational answer. Was there any speculation in the halls of the Department why
                    the Soviets invaded in the first place?</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There are a lot of theories about their invasion. There was considerable
                    speculation about two events in 1979 - first of all, a coup d'etat took place in
                    Afghanistan earlier that year that had installed some Soviet puppets. In
                    response, a popular uprising sprang up which was on verge of overthrowing the
                    communist regime. It seemed the Soviets would not allow that to happen, because
                    they were concerned about a possible ripple effect in other parts of the world,
                    and therefore they invaded Afghanistan to preserve the communist regime. This
                    was also a period when we had pulled out of Angola after Congress issued a
                    prohibition against providing assistance to the rebels there, and in Ethiopia,
                    the emperor was overthrown and Mengistu took control. It looked like the U.S.
                    under Carter was pulling back across the globe. All of these events had to be
                    factors in Soviet calculations; they must have seen that the U.S., under Jimmy
                    Carter, was being less ideological and not responding to changes which previous
                    administrations might well have plunged into. In Moscow, USSR leadership must
                    have been assumed that since the U.S. was so passive it would be safe to invade
                    Afghanistan. In retrospect, I think all these factors had an impact.</p>
                <p>The Russian puppet regime was quite ineffective but Afghanistan in the early
                    1980s was not beset by overall, raging civil war. Most of the country was quite
                    peaceful. But it was the continual pressure from the mujahadeen in the east and
                    north that kept the pot boiling. There were terrible stories about Afghans
                    capturing pairs of Soviet soldiers and killing one, hacking his body up, and
                    putting it in a bag that the other soldier would then have to carry back to the
                    base. It was brutal and very violent on both sides.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I mentioned, George Shultz had been impressed by my appearance on the
                    McNeil-Lehrer News Hour and when there was an opening for a deputy spokesperson,
                    he remembered and asked me to take the job. So I became the first woman
                    spokesperson for the Department of State, a total surprise and jump ahead in my
                    career. I think this episode is proof that one never knows in life what lies
                    around the corner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think your experience is just one more proof that the
                        “system” does not usually find a job for an officer; it is done more
                        frequently by happenstance or through the associations one forms during a
                        career.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: That's right. Let me go back a bit. I should mention that as time passed,
                    more and more people were added to work on the Afghanistan issue. There was a
                    fellow by the name of Gerry Helman, who was brought into P to address questions
                    about our assistance to relief agencies and to take care of the refugees. There
                    was concern expressed in late '84 and '85 that all of eastern Afghanistan was
                    being depopulated to such a degree that there were not enough local people to
                    support the mujahadeen. That was when humanitarian assistance really began.
                    Charlie Dunbar returned to NEA to worry about our role in negotiations; he
                    worked with Diego Cordovez, the UN special negotiator, in New York.</p>
                <p>Despite all of this additional help, it was becoming an impossible job. I finally
                    decided that I would seek reassignment by the summer of 1985. I talked to
                    various people, including congressional staff members, about what I should do
                    next; in the end, thanks to friends like Caz Yost, I joined Senator Mac Mathias'
                    staff under the Pearson program. He was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee and I thought he had taken very sensible positions on all sorts of
                    issues, as a moderate, internationalist Republican.</p>
                <p>I had fun working with the senator and his staff. About two or three weeks after
                    I reported to his office, he announced that he would not seek reelection, which
                    was a great disappointment for me because I was looking forward to watching a
                    senatorial campaign from the “inside.” Furthermore, anyone who declares himself
                    or herself a “lame duck” loses a certain amount of cache. But I enjoyed the
                    staff I worked with; I took advantage of every opportunity to learn how things
                    worked on the Hill. I would periodically sit in on sessions of the House
                    International Relations Committee to see how things were done on that side of
                    the Capitol.</p>
                <p>My Hill experience was fun, but it paled in excitement after my work on the
                    Afghan desk. It felt very strange to have time to read the newspaper in the
                    morning. The difference in pace was unbelievable.</p>
                <p>I did go with Senator Mathias on one trip, to an Inter-Parliamentary Union
                    meeting in Luxembourg. I had never been a member of a CODEL (Congressional
                    Delegation) before - we had always been on the receiving end. The service that
                    the military keepers provided was absolutely amazing; I would have hated to find
                    out the costs. I have never seen such amenities.</p>
                <p>I should also mention that while I was working on Afghanistan, I became
                    acquainted with a number of congressmen who supported the Afghan resistance. The
                    most notable of these was Charlie Wilson (Democrat, Texas). He was a member of
                    the Armed Services Committee, and was probably the leading congressional
                    supporter of a “free Afghanistan.” It was rumored to he had helped the
                    mujahadeen acquire a Swiss made missile, followed by the U.S. “Stinger.” Many
                    people say that it was the “Stingers” that made the decisive difference and
                    caused the Soviet withdrawal, because they brought down many helicopters and
                    raised the casualty rate too high for the USSR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for congressional views of the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had first hand experience with State's responsiveness when I went with
                    the CODEL - no way that the State Department could match the military. I also
                    was amazed by the number of lobbyists who came to see Mathias, to talk about
                    such mundane matters as the brand of furniture that State was purchasing. I had
                    never been aware of the pressures that a Senator or a congressman was under to
                    take action on what appeared to me to be a relatively minor issue - i.e.
                    furniture for the Foreign Service. Seeing the pressures that are placed on our
                    representatives was a real eye opener. People pestered Mathias to call the
                    Department about furniture, about Jane Thompson, who wanted her job back in the
                    office that handled “Arts in Embassies. All these constituents wanted Mathias to
                    call the Department to make it do whatever they wanted. That was a
                    revelation.</p>
                <p>After a year on the Hill, I knew what my next assignment was going to be. I was
                    going to be the congressional liaison officer for Middle East issues in H. So my
                    nine months with Mathias proved to be invaluable. In the summer of 1986, I
                    returned to H.</p>
                <p>Once I started working in the Department again, I attended all NEA staff
                    meetings. I worked with a number of people on a wide range of issues such as
                    UNRWA funding and the peace talks. By this time, I had enough contacts on the
                    Hill to make my job considerably easier that it would have been for a newcomer.
                    Having had the experiences that I had had, I wasn't hesitant to speak out and
                    really enjoyed that job.</p>

                        the Department's arguments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That was true at a certain level, but 1986 was a rather quiet period in
                    the Middle East so there weren't many contentious issues. By the late 1980s,
                    there was increased activity under the leadership of George Shultz. By that
                    time, I was Deputy Spokesperson; that was a very active period with the
                    beginning of the first “Intifada.” That changed a lot of things. But 1986 was
                    relatively quiet in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>The one exception was Lebanon where the civil war was still raging; that kept us
                    busy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Iran-Iraq war a matter of concern? Or were we just

                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: We pretty much sat on the sideline. Neither of these counties was a great
                    friend of ours, although it must be said that later we tilted toward Saddam
                    Hussein. We gave him some assistance. There was still resentment against Iran
                    for its attack on our embassy and the holding of our staff as hostages. But
                    there really wasn't much we wanted to or could do in the Iran-Iraq war. There
                    was a general feeling that we didn't want Iraq to lose, although they were
                    probably the instigators of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how effective H was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: During this period, I thought H did a good job. I encouraged people like
                    Roy Atherton and others in NEA to go to Congress. I knew all the people in the
                    NEA front office. I thought they did a terrific job when they testified or just
                    spoke to people on the Hill. So I encouraged them to keep in contact with
                    congressmen and their staffs and to take the initiative. There had always been a
                    question about H's functions. Was it a bridge to get more State officials to
                    maintain contacts on the Hill or was it a dam which was to control the flow of
                    information to Congress? It my days, it was a bridge and we worked diligently to
                    get State people to talk to Hill people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are not only talking about hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: No. I refer primarily to informal briefings, which could be given by desk
                    officers or INR staff people. The important point was that we had to be visible
                    to Congress, beyond the formal appearances by the secretary or other top
                    officials.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you look with some envy on how the Pentagon handled its congressional
                    relationships?</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Of course. The Pentagon has the great advantage of the means to provide
                    services. Anything a congressman wanted or any arrangements for trips, the
                    Pentagon was able to provide. It had planes staffed with stewards, and
                    hospitality rooms - liquor, peanuts, candy, etc. - which were at a congressman's
                    disposal. The Pentagon had financial means that were not available to State.
                    They paid per diem for congressmen, for example - perfectly legal and effective.
                    Essentially bills for hotels and meals, when not provided by the host country or
                    organization, were paid by the Pentagon. So the Defense Department had ample
                    resources. When we were in Luxembourg - as part of Mathias' staff - the
                    delegation went to a china factory. People were buying whole sets of dishes! But
                    the military was there to package boxes and put them on the plane back to the
                    U.S. I didn't need any nor did I want any dishes, so I had money left over,
                    which I returned to the congressional office, only to be told that no one ever
                    did that. But I didn't see how I could take it. It was sheer surplus, gravy if
                    you will, since all of my expenses had been covered.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Pentagon's congressional operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: We worked very closely with the Pentagon liaison staff. They made all of
                    Mathias' travel arrangements. We had to know what these arrangements were, of
                    course, and what program was being developed. This past year a recommendation
                    was made to the Secretary of State that State offices be opened on both the
                    Senate and House sides to improve contacts. In the end it was turned down by the
                    Secretary on advice from Barbara Lutkin, head of H, who was concerned about
                    losing control - very sad. I heard that she was worried about having officers on
                    the Hill whom she couldn't control minute by minute. That was sheer folly. The
                    Department had a grand opportunity and blew it.</p>
                <p>Q: It has been said that often congressional people complain that their requests
                    for information are often ignored by the Department. Was that a problem at this
                    time?</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I have heard the same criticism. I am working with some task forces now
                    which are addressing what is commonly referred to as “the culture of the State
                    Department.” One of the reported traits of that culture is that State doesn't
                    want to share information with Congress. I have told people that I was somewhat
                    surprised to hear that because in Washington and overseas that had not been my
                    experience. When we were in Zaire, we were anxious to have congressional
                    visitors. When we were in Pakistan, we had tons of CODELs. Charlie Wilson came
                    out two or three times. It was great to have that much attention paid to us. So
                    I never opposed sharing information with Congress and I am always amazed when
                    Hill staffers complain about how difficult it is to get anything out of the
                    Department. I understand State is often perceived as an organization that wants
                    to run everything and wants to shut out other participation, even if perfectly
                    legitimate. I don't know how that sentiment got started and has been
                    perpetuated, but it has really hurt the Department.</p>

                        officers to provide information without approval from their bosses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That was true on certain issues, such as what the CIA was doing to help
                    the mujahadeen. I, of course, as desk officer didn't know and I wasn't
                    interested in knowing because I knew that if people thought I had the
                    information, they would constantly try to get it out of me. A basic question is
                    how much confidence an officer has in his or her ability to handle inquiries. If
                    you have a personal relationship with a congressional staffer and feel that you
                    can trust him or her, then you can be much more open.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was in Mathias' office from September 1985 to June 1986. Then I
                    returned to H until late October or early November, 1986 when I got a call from
                    Chuck Redman, who had just been appointed Spokesman for the Department, after
                    the departure of Bernie Kalb. Bernie had been a well-known journalist, covering
                    the Department, and had become the Department's spokesman at the request of
                    George Shultz. I don't think that appointment in the end was a particularly good
                    fit, because Kalb felt bypassed on some key information on the Iran-Contra
                    affair. That story broke in the fall of 1986. So Kalb resigned and Redman moved
                    up. He was a career officer who had spent most of his time in Europe and was
                    very articulate. I think the Secretary decided it was better to have a career
                    Foreign Service officers as spokesmen rather than outsiders. The job had to be
                    filled rather quickly.</p>
                <p>Chuck came to see me in H and asked whether I would be interested in the job of
                    Deputy Spokesman (that was the term in use then). I was overcome - it came out
                    the clear blue yonder. I had never even thought about it as a possibility. I was
                    happy in H, but I saw the Spokesman's job as an opportunity. So in mid-November,
                    1986, I was announced and presented; I worked in PA until the end of January,
                    1989 when administrations changed and Bob was appointed Ambassador to
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I never dreamed that I would be the Department's spokesperson, appearing on TV
                    and radio and being quoted in the print media. I was a daunting experience.
                    First, there was a training period that taught me the process of preparing for
                    questions, and how to handle them. I had to arrive at the office between 6:30
                    and 7:00 a.m. Then we held a telephone meeting trying to anticipate what
                    questions might arise, which was followed by dialogue with desk officers on what
                    appropriately could be said. Desk officers were asked to draft potential
                    replies. As the deputy spokesperson, I was allowed to attend Shultz' staff
                    meeting at 8:30. Then back to the office where after 10:30 I would see a steady
                    stream of people bringing us guidance on what the Department's answers might be
                    to the anticipated questions. We would review these papers - some we would
                    accept while others were sent back for more work. We would also watch the early
                    morning news programs as well as read the summaries of the press prepared by one
                    of our staff members. It was very important that we watch the TV programs
                    because sometime they gave clues about what appeared to be of interest to the
                    media. It was not a completely reliable indicator because TV news had to be so
                    condensed. The real test of the media's interest came out of the stories in the
                    major newspapers - e.g., The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall
                    Street Journal, The Miami Herald (on Latin America), The Boston Globe, The Los
                    Angeles Times (particularly on Asian matters).</p>
                <p>Then off to the seventh floor to clear the guidance with D (John Whitehead, the
                    Deputy Secretary). Finally, to the press office to review once again the list of
                    potential questions and answers. Between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m., we would enter the
                    briefing room and mount the podium, and try to answer questions. I would usually
                    attend these briefings seated in the first chair listening to Chuck field the
                    questions. In the last year, Shultz and Chuck were on the road a lot of the
                    time, leaving most of the briefing chore to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I should talk a little about my first couple of appearances “on stage.” Don
                    Oberdorfer, the diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post, had been my
                    husband's best friend since college days. They had been at Princeton together;
                    their names started with “OA” and “OB” and thus they sat next to each other and
                    I think belonged to the same club. They were extremely close. I had some real
                    doubts about being able to handle Don's questions from the podium - I couldn't
                    imagine how it would feel. Fortunately, the first briefing went fine. At the
                    second briefing, just as we were getting to the end, Don raised his hand and
                    asked what I could say about a new fishing treaty between the Soviet Union and
                    Vanuatu. I didn't have the slightest idea of where Vanuatu was! My whole life
                    passed in front of my eyes; I wondered what I was doing on stage trying to
                    answer that question. My first inclination was just to laugh, but I really
                    couldn't because I was in public view in front of TV cameras. I pulled on my
                    cheeks to keep from laughing and said, “I am sorry I don't have anything on
                    that. I'll have to get back to you!” I must say that it is one of the most vivid
                    memories of my life as spokesperson. I knew that somewhere along the line, Don
                    would pull a stunt like that; he just could not resist the temptation.</p>
                <p>My other vivid memory of this assignment came from our daily watching of the
                    early morning TV news, which I mentioned earlier. Sometime near the beginning of
                    the assignment, I was reading news items when all of a sudden I heard a familiar
                    voice. I looked up and there I was on TV! I can't really express how surprised
                    and shocked I was to see and hear myself on the screen making a statement. I
                    wondered how I ever got there.</p>
                <p>My son made the funniest comment of all. He was just out of college and living at
                    home as he started his career. He said, “I was on the Beltway driving rather
                    fast and I heard your voice; so I slowed down and put on my seat belt!” I am
                    sure it came as a shock to him to hear his mother on the public airways, ever
                    watching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Iran-Contra and the Secretary's role - or non-role -
                        an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes and no. The Senate held long, televised hearings on the issue. Shultz
                    was very effective as he was very well prepared. He spoke about “trust being the
                    coin of the realm” and that “nothing was ever finished in Washington” (that is,
                    the same subject keeps cropping up periodically). He said that he didn't know
                    much, if anything, about Iran-Contra. It was clear that he was not the decision
                    maker in this process; that was obviously done in the White House. There are
                    many people who now insist that he knew much more than he admitted in 1986. I
                    have read Shultz' autobiography and looked at what he had to say about this
                    story quite carefully. I think he slid over his part. It was undoubtedly a
                    complicated issue. You may remember that he was on a Sunday TV talk show one
                    Sunday morning when the Iran-Contra story was breaking. Toward the end of the
                    interview, Leslie Stahl asked whether he was in charge of Iranian policy. He
                    answered, “No!” After the Iran-Contra affair had been put to rest more or less,
                    Shultz appeared once again on her Sunday talk show. Stahl asked the same
                    question and he said, “Now I am!” That was very interesting.</p>
                <p>I should say that I didn't have a clue about what was going on with Iran-Contra.
                    I found out about it after the fact. Bob was really the first one to tell me
                    about it, as we were driving home one evening from the Department, as he had
                    picked it up from his counter-terrorism work and dealing with the hostages in
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of George Shultz as a person and
                        as Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had the greatest respect for him and I thought he was wonderful. He
                    held regular staff meetings that were longer than his predecessors; but still
                    very businesslike. He dealt with people evenly. He established a practice of
                    reaching down into the bureaucracy. In Public Affairs, we had three or four
                    women who worked for him, making all the physical arrangements for his public
                    appearances such as scheduling, teleprompter, and height of the podium. They
                    loved working for him and he was nice to them; he cared about them. He was just
                    a nice person.</p>
                <p>I will never forget one of my first meetings with him. He asked me how I was
                    doing. I told him that I hadn't given the store away yet. He looked at me with
                    his Buddha-like expression and said, “It will only happen once!” I think he was
                    joking.</p>
                <p>But I must say that I was not at ease with him at the beginning - I held him in
                    such high esteem that I was very nervous, unusual for me, despite the fact that
                    he had invited me to chat with him on occasion. In retrospect, I feel bad about
                    that because he was obviously reaching out to me and I didn't fully respond as
                    well as I might have. I was too much in awe. In later years, of course, the
                    relationship has become easier and much more informal, particularly at Princeton
                    reunions where we joke and laugh together.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I will probably be best known for one particular comment I made in a briefing.
                    This was about the alleged tattoo of a tiger the Secretary was supposed to have
                    on his rear end - a souvenir of his undergraduate days at Princeton. We were
                    laughing in the press office about what we might say if someone raised the
                    question. People were giving all sorts of replies; one particularly amused me.
                    So when asked the question about confirming the tattoo, I said, “I am not in a
                    position to comment!” That became my 15 minutes of fame - I am still introduced
                    by someone who will use the quote. Don Oberdorfer, every time he introduces me
                    at a meeting, still uses that line. I must confess that I was not the
                    originator; in fact, it came from one of the women in the press office known for
                    her wit, but at least I used it at the right moment. Even George Shultz has
                    found it the perfect “bon mot” and gets a real kick out of the episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say that George Shultz in all of the interviews I
                        and my colleagues have done, comes through as the favorite Secretary of
                        State, both as a person and as a foreign policy professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Shultz was a good manager and he reached out to lots of people. There is
                    a story that when he first came to the Department, he came alone, saying he was
                    not bringing anyone to replace the existing staff. He told them that he would
                    rely and count on them. It is very much what Colin Powell said when he became
                    secretary yesterday. Shultz held systematic and focused meetings which would
                    include people usually not seen on the seventh floor; he would meet regularly
                    with all officers of the Department. A story is told about the time, following a
                    particularly tough period of negotiations with the Israelis, he walked down to
                    the Office of Arab-Israeli Affairs just to thank the whole staff for their
                    efforts to support him.</p>
                <p>I must add that there were some of his policies with which I did not agree. For
                    example, I thought the U.S. position on the “Intifada” was too pro-Israeli and
                    not sufficiently cognizant of legitimate Palestinian complaints. I thought also
                    he was too soft on Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.</p>
                <p>As I said, he was a very good manager, but not a perfect one. The Foreign Service
                    Institute owes its building and upgrading to George Shultz who was always
                    interested in training and education. I don't say that FSI should not have been
                    done, but there were other needs as well that were not satisfied, although I
                    believe that the Department, if the secretary had really wished, could have
                    gotten higher appropriations from Congress. Traditionally when budget fights got
                    tense, there were two or three congressmen and senators who at the last moment
                    would come to the Department's rescue and convince their colleagues to
                    appropriate at least what the administration had requested. That support was not
                    evident in later years; things changed a great deal after Shultz.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>But when people talk about management of the Department, particularly in the
                    recent awful years, they refer to Shultz as the last great manager. Jim Baker
                    did a lot of good things, but he was not a manager, nor was Warren Christopher,
                    nor Madeleine Albright - I think we hit bottom under her stewardship. We must be
                    thankful to have Colin Powell now who understands that among his high priorities
                    must be the proper tending of the Foreign Service. When he was testifying
                    recently, he said that while visiting U.S. installations abroad and comparing
                    military establishments with those of the State Department you could hardly
                    believe that both sets of installations were being supported by the same
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with some of the questions that
                        were asked of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had several reactions to briefings. First of all, I had been a good
                    student and when someone asked me a question my inclination was to try to have
                    an answer to give. But there were many times that I had to deny that I could be
                    helpful or not provide full information, or that I had to say certain
                    information was classified and therefore not available to the public. There was
                    almost a hurdle to get over so that I would not give away everything I knew on
                    the subject being addressed, and to stay within the approved guidance. I did
                    improve on this score over time. But at first, I felt failure when I didn't give
                    out everything. It was not lying (Shultz had said never lie - it had never
                    occurred to me to do so!) but being careful.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I never watched a briefing that I gave without thinking I could have
                    done it better - clearer, perhaps more expansive, and so forth. In the late
                    1980s, there was one Virginia TV station that used to carry the daily briefings
                    late at night. I used to go home and watch that, often cringing. Early on I had
                    some help from a professional coach, Dorothy Sarnoff; I found her very helpful
                    with suggestions on how to improvon such things as clothing, mannerisms, hair
                    colors. For example, I felt that I looked down too much when answering
                    questions. I worked with her and another woman on how I could answer the
                    question by glancing at my guidance, but looking at the questioner when
                    replying. I was, of course, mostly concerned about the substance of the
                    presentation because I had to get that absolutely right. Presentation was of
                    secondary importance. But any woman is under more scrutiny than a man and you
                    don't want to be distracting by what you wear - or don't wear. As I said
                    earlier, Chuck Redman traveled a good deal with the Secretary. He noted that
                    during the briefings, the reporters referred to him as “Mr. Redman” and to me as
                    “Phyllis.” He said that everywhere he went, people would comment that he worked
                    with “Phyllis.” I think I had a good reputation. People did notice that I was
                    the first female spokesperson for the Department or of a Department in
                    Washington. After me, several European foreign offices employed women
                    spokespersons. In light of being a pioneer, I felt added pressure to do a good
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>One of the things I enjoyed greatly about the job was, in the morning routine
                    earlier described, our last contact with John Whitehead, the Deputy Secretary.
                    He brought in Mel Levitsky who was then Executive Secretary of the Department as
                    well as someone representing H, the congressional relations office. We would
                    review the prepared guidance and discuss the hot topics of the day. There would
                    be a give and take on approaches we might take in the briefings and what to look
                    out for - the last screening. It was such a great pleasure for me to work with
                    John Whitehead and to get to know him and to watch him work. I found him a
                    wonderful person with good sense and judgement and a great sense of humor. John
                    and I would at times giggle over possible answers - no one else saw the humor.
                    So I became very fond of him and still enjoy seeing him in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the American press corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Spotty. The role of the Department's spokesperson has changed so much
                    over the years. It was Hodding Carter who first brought in TV, when he spoke
                    daily about the Iranian hostages and what we were doing to get them home. That
                    made the briefing more formal. Over time a lot of journalists had begun to feel
                    that they didn't really want to attend the press briefings or at least not
                    always. They were secretly working on stories and they didn't want anyone to
                    know what they we doing - they were concerned that if they asked a question, it
                    might reveal what they were working on to their colleagues. One learned all
                    these various ins and outs of the press corps and their techniques to get
                    information.</p>
                <p>After the briefings, we would return to our offices and review the transcripts
                    over lunch; we would also watch TV and listen to the radio in the afternoon to
                    see what stories might have emerged from the briefings. Sometimes we would have
                    to try to repair whatever damage a wrong story might have done - reporters don't
                    always get their stories straight. Often, after this review, we would get calls
                    from journalists who were putting the final touches on their “exclusives.” They
                    were seeking an official reaction to the main threads of their stories. More
                    often than not, these were stories about issues we had not discussed previously,
                    often because our policy on the issue was still being developed and therefore we
                    had not been briefed ourselves, although we may have known some aspects. So we
                    would have to tell the caller that we didn't have a comment right then and
                    there, but that we would try to provide the answer as soon as possible.
                    Telephoning then began all over the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>We also had an elaborate system for coordination with the Defense Department,
                    CIA, and White House press offices. That coordination, I think, started with Ron
                    Nessen, but it varied in form from one White House spokesperson to another. In
                    the fall of 1986, we had an almost daily conference call with our counterparts
                    in those agencies, particularly when Iran-Contra was the issue of the day. Of
                    course, each agency was taking the position its principal did - occasionally
                    this would generate some screaming because spokesmen would object strenuously to
                    a position taken by another agency. During these very delicate periods, such as
                    Iran-Contra, we would have to go back to the Secretary for further guidance or
                    at least to tell him what other agencies were about to say. CIA Director Casey's
                    role and position on Iran-Contra was very interesting and complicated.</p>
                <p>We had periodic meetings, sometimes in the White House Mess, to discuss public
                    affairs problems. When we faced certain arms control issues, quite often it was
                    the need for press guidance that forced the administration to reach a decision.
                    One time I remember using guidance cleared by the Bureau for Politico-Military
                    Affairs, but they had not cleared it entirely with the White House. No sooner
                    had I used it, than I was called by Colin Powell, then at the NSC, who chewed me
                    out for about a half an hour - demanding to know how I could possibly have said
                    what I did. I told him that I had been given the guidance by PM and hadn't made
                    up the answer. What was happening, of course, was that PM was trying to force
                    the White House to reach a decision and was using the public affairs route to
                    serve its end. By the next day, Colin had calmed down and there were no hard
                    feelings. I soon learned that on certain issues, particularly arms control, I
                    had to get White House approval even if it meant waiting for a half hour or so
                    and delaying the briefing.</p>
                <p>I once used guidance approved by EUR concerning British reflagging of vessels
                    sailing into the Persian Gulf. Everybody cleared my guidance and thought it was
                    fine as it had been provided by the desk. But in fact, the desk had goofed. I
                    was denounced on the floor of the House of Commons! The British press attache
                    came to see me and in his usual proper, understated tone suggested that there
                    had been a slight misunderstanding and asked that I correct my statement at the
                    next opportunity. I, of course, did so, but this is a good illustration of the
                    difficulties a spokesperson faces; there is no way that he or she can know the
                    details of every issue and so you have to rely on others. On what appeared to be
                    a minor issue, such as British reflagging, we would accept guidance drafted by
                    the desk officer; on more important issues, we would seek wider clearances. I
                    found after a while I could just feel that some guidance just didn't quite sit
                    right and a warning bell would go off inside of me. Then I would check out what
                    I had been given, either to be reassured or to have it corrected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the foreign press corps that attends the
                        Department's briefings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Here again there were certain reporters that I thought were quite good.
                    Many of the Lebanese reporters wrote excellent stories, particularly about the
                    “Intifada;” their stories were balanced and tried to emphasize the core
                    issues.</p>
                <p>The attendance of the foreign press corps depended on the hot issue of the day.
                    The Europeans would show up en masse if there were a raging issue of interest to
                    their constituents. All journalists were interested in our summit meetings with
                    the Soviets; one could then expect full representation and participation by
                    European reporters. When there was a summit, the White House would organize the
                    press briefing room. I remember going to one of these, which I think was being
                    held at the Willard Hotel, and the room was huge - a ballroom filled with
                    reporters from around the world. The White House would brief the press corps
                    about any agreements reached with the Soviets, whose spokesperson also
                    participated. At one point, he was asked what Mrs. Gorbachev's schedule had been
                    with Nancy Reagan and as I had that schedule and he didn't, I handed it to the
                    Soviet, who seemed a little reluctant to use it. But what the two ladies were
                    doing was a matter of some interest and he did use it, with certain
                    elaboration.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of very interesting moments while I was in Public Affairs. I
                    found the job stressful as every word I uttered mattered. Once Vice President
                    George Bush introduced me at a luncheon at the Department to Yitzhak Shamir,
                    then the Prime Minister of Israel. We had known the Bushes for many years -
                    since USUN - so he told Shamir that he wanted him to meet the Department's
                    deputy spokesperson. Shamir (very short) looked up at me and said that he knew
                    who I was. He said that he read every word that I uttered! I was dumbfounded,
                    but it was undoubtedly true - my words were read throughout the world. It was
                    intimidating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that whatever you said, you would often
                        raise some heckles - as you undoubtedly did with the Israeli lobby when
                        discussing the “Intifada.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Of course, but I always tried to avoid trite phrases, like “the never
                    ending cycle of violence.” I tried to find other ways to express the same
                    thought, for example by expressing sympathy for the victims. Once a Palestinian
                    came to see me and told me that everyone on the West Bank knew my face. That was
                    awesome and intimidating! But I would not have missed the opportunity of
                    spokesperson for anything - to learn how the press worked, what the arms control
                    issues were, how the world looked at us and vice versa. It was truly
                    fascinating.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I used to laugh, in sorrow, because it seemed to me that when there were
                    tragedies or disasters it was always my turn to be on the podium. The first one
                    I handled was when we - or the U.S. Navy - shot down the Iranian airbus over the
                    Persian Gulf. I had to face the horde of reporters, TV cameras, and audio
                    equipment with two sentences of guidance, the essence of which was that we
                    didn't know what had happened. This happened more often than not; I would have
                    very little guidance from which to answer questions for 45 minutes. We would, of
                    course, express sympathies for the victims and their families and express our
                    concern about the incident. But there wasn't much more that anyone could
                    say.</p>
                <p>The other airplane crash that fell to me to speak about was PanAm 103. This was
                    the one brought down in midair over Lockerbie, Scotland by a bomb planted aboard
                    the plane. The recently convicted perpetrator was a Libyan secret agent. When
                    this very tragic episode was later reviewed and used during the trial, my
                    earlier briefings were rebroadcast. I used to laugh and tell my family that I
                    was a “rerun.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that sometime even regrets might be
                        difficult to utter such as in the case of the Iranian plane that we shot
                        down by accident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: No, I think regrets were always appropriate, but other comments were more
                    difficult. In the case of the Iranian plane, I could say that we would or were
                    investigating the circumstances. I knew from Bob, who was at the NSC at the
                    time, that from the beginning there were some suspicions that our military had
                    been “trigger-happy.” Over time, I think the conclusion emerged that we had not
                    been careful enough in determining what and whose plane was in the sky. We
                    didn't expect a passenger craft to be in that area and therefore were probably
                    not prudent enough before shooting. I had heard some of this speculation, but it
                    was not something that I could say publicly. But I did regret the incident and
                    expressed sympathy for the victims and their families.</p>
                <p>I was asked on occasion about our contacts with Iranians, still a hot issue in
                    the late '80s. That was a tricky question to answer. Were there any contacts,
                    formal or informal? I had to know the background of what was going on or I might
                    well have given the wrong impression or an answer that might well have been used
                    against us. The TV broadcasters were anxious to use my answers on these
                    contacts. I finally said to one of the reporters, “Baloney!” You had to be
                    careful about what sound bites might appear on the airwaves, but I thought this
                    was emphatic and clear without being derogatory.</p>
                <p>I remember during the “Lockerbie” briefings talking about how families who had
                    lost loved ones must have been feeling - their children were returning to the
                    U.S. for Christmas holidays and I truly felt their sorrow. It was a horrendous
                    deed, so sympathies were not difficult. We did pledge to help the families as
                    much as we could and then follow up with a thorough investigation.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I should mention that press guidance and the appropriateness of briefings were
                    taken very seriously. We were not supposed to be flip. On one April Fool's Day,
                    I wanted to start the briefing by saying that we had concluded four arms control
                    treaties, three friendship treaties, solved a number of refugees problems - all
                    that morning. I was told that such an approach would not be appropriate. I think
                    today the rules are somewhat less stringent, but in my day it was all straight
                    and narrow. As I have suggested, occasionally my comments were broadcast widely.
                    One day, I was answering questions about the change of government in the
                    Philippines. Had it been a coup or how would we categorize it? I finally fell
                    back on the old adage: “If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it
                    probably is a duck! It was a coup.”</p>
                <p>Among the press corps were a couple of trouble-makers. They always asked
                    difficult questions to try to put the spokesman on the spot. These were usually
                    reporters from ethnic or foreign news outlets who were accredited to the
                    Department - Greeks and Turks, Armenians, or Jews. One time, one of these guys
                    asked me how I would respond to some question about alleged U.S. activity
                    against somebody. I looked at him and smiled and said, “We would respond to that
                    issue very carefully!” The whole room burst out laughing. Even the questioner
                    said, “Touche!”</p>
                <p>In the 1998 presidential election, George Bush moved up from the vice
                    presidential spot. Shultz was to leave in January and the rumor was that Jim
                    Baker would succeed him as Secretary of State. We had known the Bakers because
                    Jim had also been a Princeton classmate of Bob's, along with Frank Carlucci.
                    Susan Baker, Jim's wife, called me after the election to ask what I could do to
                    help Margaret Tutwiler, whom Jim had picked to be the next Spokesman and
                    Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, but not yet announced - he had not yet
                    been confirmed. So it was quite hush-hush and we had to consult very discreetly.
                    I agreed to stay on at least through a transition period and really enjoyed
                    working with her.</p>
                <p>My husband had been sent to Pakistan in early September, 1988, right after the
                    death of President Zia and our ambassador, Arnie Raphel, to run the embassy as
                    ambassador in a period of great uncertainty. We didn't know whether Bob would be
                    retained as ambassador by a new administration. When Bush was elected and Baker
                    became Secretary of State, it was decided that Bob would stay. Of course, in
                    early 1989, there were major personnel changes throughout the Department and the
                    arrival of a whole new team to run it. I wanted to join my husband in Pakistan
                    so it worked out well for me to leave PA and go to Islamabad.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I think my whole experience as Deputy Spokesperson was a very positive, happy
                    one. I continue to be amazed by that assignment; not in my wildest dreams had I
                    ever thought of being offered a job like that. Occasionally, people in grocery
                    stores or at airports would stop and ask: “Haven't I seen you somewhere?” I was
                    and still am surprised by these glimmers of recognition. I thought that after a
                    while people would forget, but I still run into strangers who think that I look
                    familiar to them and I then suggest where they might have seen me. Once, one of
                    Washington's famous columnists asked me how I handled “fame.” I burst out
                    laughing because I knew that my job as Spokesperson was not permanent and that I
                    would leave the limelight sooner or later. I replied that I might be recognized
                    at the time, but I didn't expect it to be a permanent condition.</p>
                <p>Q: We are now in 1989 and you are now in Pakistan where your husband has become
                    the U.S. ambassador. How was the change from paid employment to wife?</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bob's assignment was a jolt out of the blue. As I mentioned earlier, our
                    Ambassador to Pakistan, Arnie Raphel, was killed in an airplane crash when he
                    accompanied President Zia on a visit to an army installation. Zia had been our
                    great Pakistani ally during the Afghan “jihad” against the Soviets. Arnie was
                    much beloved in the Department; he was very bright, very outgoing, full of
                    personality, and fully devoted to the Foreign Service. Many people were devoted
                    to him. I remember the morning of the crash quite clearly. We were meeting with
                    Mike Armacost, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, who was presiding at
                    an August 8:30 staff meeting in the D Conference Room, when he was called out to
                    go to the Operations Center. He returned absolutely ashen and reported to us
                    that Arnie had been killed in a plane crash. The reports coming in were quite
                    sketchy and no one knew whether the plane was brought down by accident,
                    sabotage, or by weapons. This was mid-August and I think Shultz was in New
                    Orleans at the Republican Convention. Throughout the day there were frantic
                    telephone calls to Islamabad and it was decided that it was absolutely essential
                    to send someone quickly out to Pakistan to assure the interim government that it
                    had our continued support. The White House worked on a potential list of people
                    who might be sent. I did a very short briefing, which essentially was just an
                    announcement of the crash; I told the media that we didn't have any further
                    information at that time. Everybody was absolutely stunned.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, back in my office trying to catch up, Bob called - he was then
                    the senior advisor on the Near East at the NSC (his jurisdiction included
                    Pakistan and India). He asked me whether I was sitting down and I assured him
                    that I was. He told me that he had just been asked to go to Pakistan. I could
                    hardly absorb it! Shultz returned to Washington soon thereafter and prepared to
                    fly to Pakistan to bring the bodies home and Bob was told to be on board with
                    enough clothing so that he could stay for an extended period; he was going to be
                    appointed ambassador. There was considerable concern, for Nancy Ely Raphel,
                    Arnie's widow, who had been a Department official, starting in the Legal
                    Advisor's Office and who then had worked on African matters. She was also
                    greatly admired and respected and everyone was terribly concerned for her well
                    being.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So Bob went to Islamabad and I stayed in Washington, working in Public Affairs.
                    It was Chuck Redman who accompanied the secretary on his trip to Pakistan. I
                    must say that I was somewhat peeved by that; I would have liked to have gone on
                    that trip. Throughout that fall's presidential campaign, people thought that
                    Bush would be elected, but one couldn't be sure. If Bush won, who would be
                    Secretary of State? Would Bob be asked to stay in Pakistan? There were a lot of
                    questions. So this was a period of great uncertainty about the future
                    administration and Bob's and my role in it. Bob and I had decided that we had
                    spent so much time apart that we were not going to be separated again. So we had
                    to make certain assumptions; we assumed that Bush would win the presidency, that
                    Baker would be Secretary of State, and that Bob would be requested to remain
                    iPakistan as ambassador.</p>
                <p>So I did not bid for a new assignment. By the end of January, Shultz was gone as
                    was Chuck Redman. He was succeeded by Margaret Tutwiler, whom I mentioned
                    earlier. I helped her in the transition and then I had to have a hysterectomy.
                    Bob came back for the operation and some of the recovery period. After a bit of
                    recuperation, renting the house, and packing up, I moved to Islamabad to join
                    him in February, 1989. I happened to fly out on the same plane as Senator Pat
                    Moynihan, who was on his way to visit the area, including a stop in Islamabad.
                    It was one of those flights on which you knew every other passenger - first on
                    the flight to London and then on Pakistani Airlines to Islamabad. I had gone out
                    to Pakistan in the fall to see Bob once; he had left Washington in August but
                    had returned briefly for Senate confirmation hearings, and said that he really
                    wanted me to come out even if it was for a few days to attend the Marine Ball
                    that is held on November 10. USIA was willing to send me to Europe for a
                    speaking tour, talking about the role of a spokesperson and U.S. policy in
                    general. So I went to London to meet with a number of British officials and
                    journalists and on to Italy to discuss the same issues. From Rome I flew to
                    Pakistan, where I traveled throughout the country for about a week, giving USIA-
                    sponsored presentations on the role of the American press in foreign policy, how
                    the Department and the press interacted, and the role of the press in a
                    democratic society. That was very interesting experience because it was at the
                    time Pakistan was preparing for an electio- thanks in large part to Bob's
                    prodding and pushing for a free and democratic election after Zia's death.
                    Benazir Bhutto was elected. She was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter and she and
                    her father were well known to the U.S. She was Pakistan's first female
                    president. So the Pakistanis were excited by their experience with democracy.
                    They felt they finally had got rid of military authoritarian governments. It was
                    also the time when the Soviets promised to leave Afghanistan. This arrangement,
                    worked out by George Shultz and Gorbachev, was covered fully by Don Oberdorfer
                    in his wonderful book of diplomatic history called “The Turn.”</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>So I went to Islamabad. I did not have a job and I wasn't really interested in
                    working in the embassy - where there were no positions available at the time in
                    any case. But USAID was just beginning to implement its programs that had been
                    developed to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. As the Soviets
                    retreated, a temporary government was being set up in Peshawar, Pakistan, led by
                    the seven resistance leaders. Efforts were made to give each of the seven
                    confidence that they could work with the other six. So there was considerable
                    activity about setting up an Afghan Interim Government, some of it visible and
                    some of it under the surface, in part relating to Saudi Arabian assistance to
                    fundamentalist groups. The conventional wisdom was that the government of
                    Najubullah in Kabul - seen by some as a Soviet puppet - would fall soon after
                    the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, to be succeeded by the mujahadeen leaders
                    who would then establish a more permanent governmental structure among
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Conventional wisdom was wrong. Najubullah did not fall; he was an able Afghan
                    supported by a civil service structure that the Soviets had created. Women had a
                    certain amount of freedom, which was unusual, in a very conservative society.
                    They were professionals - doctors, teachers, judges. There were a lot of Afghans
                    afraid of the conservative mujahadeen leaders, afraid of those who seemed
                    determined to set up a conservative government and a society that adhered to
                    their fundamentalist views. Tribal and regional leaders would become important
                    once again and women would be severely restricted in their lives. So there were
                    a lot of Afghans who did not relish those prospects and therefore continued to
                    support Najubullah.</p>
                <p>The AID Afghanistan Humanitarian Assistance program had been developed when
                    Soviet pressure in 1988-89 on eastern Afghan provinces made it appear that the
                    mujahadeen might be subjected to such hardships that they could not continue as
                    a viable force operating there, next to their bases in Pakistan. So the
                    assistance program was designed to help the people remaining in the eastern
                    provinces and to try to prevent them from fleeing into Pakistan which already
                    had the world's largest refugee population. These refugees lived in camps
                    supported by the UNHRC. The AID program included projects for education, health
                    care, and agriculture. Logistic services were developed to deliver the material
                    into Afghanistan. I should note that no American was allowed to enter
                    Afghanistan; we established collection and training stations in and around
                    Peshawar and the Afghans took it from there. There were NGOs - e.g. Mercy Corps,
                    the Red Cross, and the International Rescue Committee - who did work in
                    Afghanistan, supposedly without Americans. The ICRC, for example, had
                    established several hospitals inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan - one of which
                    I had visited earlier in 1983.</p>
                <p>I thought that working for USAID in Islamabad would be a natural for me. It
                    involved issues with which I was familiar - I knew the Afghan political scene
                    and I knew congressional views. After the Soviet departure from Afghanistan, we
                    continued to provide support to the mujahadeen who were still expected to take
                    over the government once Najubullah fell. We tried to help them get organized
                    into ministries. But in one sense we didn't give them resources to govern, and
                    old patterns of military assistance continued.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, we might say we concentrated on getting the
                        Soviets out of Afghanistan and not Najubullah. He was succeeded in some
                        respects by worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think as time went by it became clearer that Najubullah was a smart
                    leader who had the support of a large number of Afghans. In retrospect, I think
                    we should probably have tried to make a deal with him. It may not have been
                    possible in the early 1990s because the Afghan leaders in Pakistan would have
                    objected strenuously. The strongest military leader of this group was Gulbaddin
                    Hekmatyar who was very conservative and somewhat anti-American. There was Ahmad
                    Shah Masoud, Lion of the Panjshu Valley, a leader in northern Afghanistan where
                    the Tajiks and the Uzbeks lived. There was a fellow by the name of Pir Gailani,
                    who was a Pushtun hereditary nobleman and very westernized; he didn't have much
                    support. There was a leader by the name of Mojeddedi, with whom I had dealt
                    often; he was probably the most westernized mujahadeen leader. He had a son who
                    was a doctor in the U.S. The major problem was that these leaders, because of
                    tribal, social, and religious differences, just couldn't get their act together;
                    they could not find any common ground; they were constantly working against each
                    other. As I said before, I have always felt that in most guerrilla-rebel
                    situations there was some chief who eventually took control. For example, you
                    had Tito in Yugoslavia and Ben Bella in Algeria. In most uprisings, one leader
                    emerged to take over the leadership however ruthlessly. For many reasons,
                    principally for control purposes, the Pakistanis had developed a
                    divide-and-conquer policy or didn't change it. Therefore these various factions
                    were inhibited from uniting. The attitude of enmity was so ingrained that the
                    rebel leadership just couldn't get together. The Pakistanis seemed to back
                    Hekmatyar; others resented that support.</p>
                <p>I can't say that I ever understood completely the politics of the situation as so
                    much was handled by CIA and ISS of Pakistan. There were accusations that our
                    assistance favored Hekmatyar. The response was that he was the most effective
                    fighter and therefore merited major support. When AID hired me, I became
                    responsible for working with the “interim” government in Peshawar to help them
                    set up a public affairs and public relations program, including newsletters to
                    inform the public about the interim government's efforts. I also worked on the
                    narcotic program, with which we hoped to start some kind of crop suppression or
                    substitution effort. Poppy production was not nearly as large as it is today,
                    but it still was much too high.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>In the beginning, among the AID staff, I felt there was considerable resentment
                    of me. That didn't apply to Larry Crandall, the mission chief, who was very
                    imaginative and had in fact developed the program on which I was to work. I
                    liked him a lot; we worked well together. He saw the political requirements of
                    having some one work with this new government to help bring things together. I
                    really wasn't qualified to be an education consultant or a public health worker
                    or any other highly specialized technician, but I could do what Larry had
                    outlined. In the second and third echelons of this AID mission, there was a lot
                    of resentment. People were concerned about perceived nepotism. I think everyone
                    acknowledged that I might know more about Afghan politics than anyone else in
                    the mission, but there was the feeling that as the ambassador's wife, I was
                    being foisted on them. I saw it as just another experience in an area of change
                    for spouses that I had gone through before in Zaire. One just had to ignore the
                    resentments and do the job as best one could. Eventually, I think I overcame
                    much of the resentment. Even the deputy mission director, who eventually
                    admitted that he had opposed my appointment and that he had not thought that I
                    would be a useful addition to the staff, said that he had been wrong and he
                    thought that I had made a worthwhile contribution. I was careful to always be in
                    the office on time; I was usually among the last to leave because I just could
                    walk home within the Embassy compound.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time in Peshawar working with groups like the Afghan Media
                    Resource Center, which was headed by Haji Dahoud. He also worked closely with
                    USIA on programs intended to encourage eventual democratic Afghan government. I
                    think that a lot of good came out of these projects, some of which we may be
                    seeing now. The AID program was not designed to help Afghans who lived in
                    Pakistan. It was directed toward the delivery of services and goods into
                    Afghanistan, particularly the east. For example, previous Afghan governments had
                    had educational links with the University of Nebraska - they were again hired to
                    send out a lot of experts on text book development for elementary grades,
                    printing them (on Xerox machines) and distributing them all over the country.
                    The basic themes of these textbooks were Afghan, but they had an overlay of
                    American educational theory. Those were the only textbooks available to the
                    children; in many places, AID clinics were the only health facilities for a wide
                    area. So much of the country relied completely on U.S. assistance.</p>
                <p>I later headed - from 1993-1997 - the bureau that handled refugee affairs and was
                    glad to have worked with a woman named Marissa Lino, who was the refugee
                    coordinator in Pakistan. She was responsible for coordinating our tremendous
                    assistance through the UNHCR for Afghan refugees. So we had a lot of programs to
                    support the Afghans, and they had to be closely coordinated within the embassy
                    in an effort to develop and follow a coherent U.S. position on Afghanistan. I
                    was working with the CIA also, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little if you will about what changes were taking
                        in the American psyche out in the area as we moved from supporting a
                        rebellion to trying to put a government together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I said, Pakistani policy had been to keep control of the divided
                    Afghan leadership and we went along with it - we couldn't change it and our
                    object was to inflict damage on the Soviets. When the Soviets left, Pakistan
                    reverted to traditional views on Afghanistan; it was extremely concerned about
                    the revival of the movement which had supported an independent Pashtunistan that
                    would have incorporated large parts of the North-West Frontier Provinces and the
                    eastern part of Afghanistan, also populated by Pushtun tribes. The Pakistanis
                    did not want this to happen. The Pakistan grand strategy was always to have
                    Afghanistan closely allied to it if not under its control, in order to achieve
                    “strategic depth” in its continued rivalry with India. A lot of people would say
                    today, given modern weapons including nuclear ones, the concept of “strategic
                    depth” has long outlived its usefulness. It is like the Golan Heights on
                    Israel's borders - what appeared to be a strategic requirement some years ago
                    has been made obsolete by modern military capabilities.</p>
                <p>I think that there were games being played and activities that we didn't pay
                    enough attention to. When we look now at the activities of certain Arabs who
                    were sent on jihad, sometimes to Afghanistan just to get them out of their own
                    countries (especially from Saudi Arabia, where they were perceived to be a
                    danger to the regime), we can see that they were more dangerous than we had
                    thought. So the whole picture was quite muddled. The problems created by the
                    Afghan leaders didn't help. The “seven dwarfs,” as some people called them,
                    simply could not come together and agree to form a unity government. And the
                    United States simply wasn't very interested politically after the Soviets left.
                    We did walk away.</p>
                <p>I have given this era considerable thought; I didn't, and don't, have access to
                    CIA secret operations and therefore can not have a complete picture. I have some
                    suspicions about the Agency's activities, but no documentary evidence.
                    Nevertheless, I think we might have played our cards on the Afghan issue
                    differently and might have thereby had a chance to build something in
                    Afghanistan that might not have been subject to the stresses and divisions that
                    it subsequently had to face. I admit that nothing was ever sure in Afghanistan.
                    The conventional wisdom fell short, that Najubullah would fall quickly and the
                    mujahadeen would easily take over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the criticisms of the Afghan leaders that I have
                        heard was that they sat in Pakistan far behind the fighting and were not
                        with their men, not to mention leading their men.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think that Hekmatyar actually did lead his fighters. Some of the others
                    - Sayyaf, Mojeddedi, Gailani - were older and were not expected to lead the
                    charge. In any case, these were political and not military leaders. I think the
                    early decision to support all seven leaders and not to coalesce behind one
                    overall leader was erroneous. I understand the motivation; Pakistan and the U.S.
                    in the early 1980s felt that if a single leader were chosen - or forced on the
                    others - the whole resistance movement might well have collapsed. Furthermore,
                    there was a theory that a diverse opposition with multiple leaders would be much
                    harder for the Soviets to defeat.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I think we need to recognize that the Afghan leadership issue is a very
                    complicated one, with any number of writers who have tried to tackle it. There
                    was a UN negotiating process underway during the late 1980s, led by Diego
                    Cordovez of the UN. So there had been some prospect for resolution of the
                    disputes between the Soviets, the Afghan government, the Afghan resistance, the
                    U.S. and the Pakistanis. In the end, some aspects of the UN plan were adopted,
                    but it did not become a complete peace plan.</p>
                <p>I should mention that another difficulty in resolving the Afghan situation was
                    that we were not talking to the Iranians, who had objectives of their own. They
                    were housing lots of Afghan refugees; those refugees, although also supported by
                    the UNHRC, were in a different situation from those in Pakistan. In recent
                    times, we began to meet alongside if not with Iranians, and central Asian
                    leaders as well as Pakistanis on the future of Afghanistan, because it was clear
                    that fighting continued even after Soviet withdrawal because of outside
                    support.</p>
                <p>Without going into a full discussion of Afghanistan's most recent history, there
                    are a couple of important issues that I would like to mention. Everyone thinks
                    that the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan was the zenith of the
                    USSR's empire. When they retreated, it was very much like the U.S. getting out
                    of Vietnam - they decided that the cost-benefit ratio did not support further
                    occupation of Afghanistan. We really did not defeat them or force them out -
                    they made the decision.</p>
                <p>It has been a very sad period for the Afghans; they were a very traditional
                    society, as I have mentioned, but not intolerant. Many foreigners who lived in
                    Afghanistan, working for governmental or non-governmental organizations, loved
                    Afghanistan and its people. They have the most wonderful faces in the world.
                    They are tall and dignified and attractive - and ferocious. In my AID job, I had
                    to go to Peshawar almost once each week to meet with various leaders, to check
                    on projects, and to confer with the Afghan Media Center. The first challenge was
                    always how to get there. If you flew, it was on a very small plane that shook
                    and shuddered; driving took three hours on some difficult stretches - two lanes
                    with buses, trucks, and carts. We would cross the Indus River guarded by old
                    frontier forts. Peshawar was fascinating, like Aleppo. It was very cold in the
                    winter and men sat in storefronts eating, drinking tea. There were a few stores
                    that dealt in antiquities - early Iranian, early Mogul. Then there were the rug
                    bazaars and dealers in the old sections of town. It was a world so far removed
                    from ours that one felt on another planet. It was an absolutely fascinating
                    city.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>I often stayed with the American counsel, Jerry Fierstein, who was an old friend
                    - he had worked on the Pakistan desk when I was working on the Afghanistan desk.
                    He was in the tradition of many good officers who had been assigned as consul to
                    Peshawar; it was such a key spot in Pakistan. There were a lot of other
                    Americans there; it was the headquarters for all of the relief agencies. There
                    was an American Club of some notoriety; it had dining and recreational
                    facilities and a bar. For a lot of the Americans, this was their only refuge on
                    their days off. There would be parties on Valentine's Day, Halloween, etc. -
                    rather wild, I was told. Once they held a California beach party; people came
                    with “surf” boards - actually ironing boards - they held a wet tee-shirt
                    contesall good college fun. Young people needed to blow off steam - after a
                    session at the Club, they would return to teaching English, managing computer
                    programs, writing reports, and working in medical clinics. The Club was their
                    refuge.</p>
                <p>The Pakistani governor was an important figure in the Northwest Frontier Province
                    because he ran the government - in the areas that were governable. He was
                    usually a retired military man who thus had close connections to the army. There
                    were some areas beyond Pakistani control, where Afghan rebels trained. Peshawar
                    was always a fountain of information on what was going on in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>Once I came across a very interesting report on poppy production written by an
                    aid worker, who had gone into the Helmund Valley, where in the 1970s the U.S.
                    had provided lots of assistance for a huge irrigation and hydroelectric power
                    project. The area became very fertile for cotton - and poppies - and the worker
                    reported on the current valley leadership that he had found. I took the report
                    and distilled it into a long cable back to Washington, also reporting on what we
                    were planning to work out a deal with him. One day in Islamabad, the old Helmund
                    Valley Afghan leader, Mullah Nassem, asked to see Bob. I sat in on the meeting,
                    along with several others including the DEA representative. Mullah Nassem was
                    willing to make a deal with us: if we were willing to provide a certain amount
                    of assistance to resume power generation, he would see to it that poppy
                    cultivation would cease. He also wanted irrigation ditches and power lines
                    rebuilt in his province; he didn't have the resources to do it on his own. After
                    discussing the proposal among ourselves, we were prepared to accept it, which I
                    think could have had a substantial impact on reducing poppy cultivation in that
                    area of Afghanistan. We cabled Washington again with our plan. But Washington
                    sent a blistering cable back, instructing us to cut off any further dealing with
                    this leader. We were told that our plan was not acceptable and could be in
                    violation of law, which prohibited any assistance being provided to a known
                    narcotics trafficker. The Washington guidance left us speechless because it was
                    so self-defeating. We wanted to know why we hadn't heard anything in response to
                    our first telegram on the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>The answer was obviously that someone in Washington had not been paying attention
                    when he or she should have been. Unfortunately, in light of the silence from
                    headquarters, the embassy had more or less given indications of being agreeable
                    to the proposition. In fact, all the planning was proceeding well when
                    Washington pulled the plug. I have always felt that Washington made a great
                    mistake, or maybe we did by telling them. I think we could have done a great
                    deal to nip the expanding production of heroin at that time if we had been
                    willing to provide assistance so Afghans could have grown alternative crops.
                    When the Taliban came to power in the 1990s, I don't think they used poppy
                    production as a policy tool and later banned it. Nevertheless, there was
                    expanding heroin processing in Pakistan, with production going to Europe. These
                    revenues helped finance a lot of the continued fighting in the 1990s - but also
                    kept farmers alive.</p>
                <p>Later, that old Afghan leader was assassinated in one of the tribal wars, so that
                    we didn't have to face his wrath - which in my view was entirely justified in
                    light of our first meeting with him. This episode, I think, is an interesting
                    sidelight to the Afghan picture of the last fifteen years.</p>
                <p>When I first went to Peshawar in 1983 - I was then the Afghan desk officer and
                    out for a familiarization trip visiting the refugee camps - my overwhelming
                    memory was of dust. I still can see the long lines of Afghan men walking from
                    the camps into the city, to the relief agencies, or Pakistani government
                    offices, one after another all day long. The sides of the roads were always
                    packed and there were not many cars. It was a drab and somewhat depressing
                    picture.</p>
                <p>By the time I returned in 1989, Peshawar was “Pajero-land.” I didn't see as many
                    people walking and the refugees by this time had acquired other means of
                    transportation - trucks, vans, Pajeros, or other SUVs - it was a complete change
                    from just six years earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>In spite of early resentment against me, I ended up enjoying my tour with AID. I
                    learned a great deal about how that agency works - such things as the
                    programming system, and the contracting system. I had to go to a two-week course
                    in Lahore devoted to learning how projects are developed and managed. I came
                    away from that session with the feeling that AID is so encrusted with
                    bureaucratic barnacles - mostly imposed by Congresthat require that every step
                    of the process be fully documented and traceable - that the agency had become an
                    almost ineffective operation. It took so long to set up the projects and
                    implement them that they often lost their effectiveness; I admit that there were
                    often large sums of money involveIn contrast, when I worked in USIA, where the
                    amount of money was much less, there was an operational flexibility that allowed
                    projects to be developed and executed very quickly. There were procedures, but
                    they did not interfere with prompt response to whatever the need or the
                    opportunity required. In AID's case, if there was a long range development plan
                    that had been approved by all concerned, then projects within that plan could be
                    approved rather easily. But new initiatives were very difficult to mount. It
                    took people like Larry Crandall, with his Afghan humanitarian program, to figure
                    out how to work the system so that emergency requirements could be met promptly.
                    He was a genius when it came to that; others didn't have that same ability.</p>
                <p>His plan was the most innovative one that I have ever seen. As I said, it
                    encompassed education, public health, and agriculture. He found a couple of
                    former Afghan agriculture ministers to work on orchards, getting people
                    fertilizers, and assistance with irrigation to get fruit trees growing again.
                    Crandall set up an Afghan trucking company so that the supplies for all of the
                    projects were delivered on time and economically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Afghanistan in the late 1980s still in a war time
                        situation or had the country returned to more or less peacetime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There was no question that the level of fighting that had taken place
                    during the Soviet occupation had abated. But fighting continued, particularly in
                    the east, and the situation was still very dangerous. American officials were
                    not allowed to travel into the country. Individual Americans - e.g. journalists
                    and some NGOs - went in, but they were few.</p>
                <p>The infrastructure had crumbled after ten years. In the Afghan climate, with its
                    extreme heat and cold, it is hard to maintain construction - roads, buildings -
                    without constant maintenance. I am deeply moved by all the reports filtering out
                    now from Afghanistan about children dying of starvation and cold. The country
                    has had a terrible drought for some time, food supplies are low, the Taliban is
                    making a mess of governance, foreign entities are reluctant to provide
                    assistance because of the nature of the Taliban's policies, and as I said,
                    fighting continues. The situation in Afghanistan is a real challenge for
                    American non-governmental aid agencies. They want to help the people, but are
                    reluctant to do so in light of the Taliban's treatment of women. Everyone is in
                    a bind.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you as a woman find dealing with the seven Afghan
                        leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Some would not shake my hand. They could not bring themselves to touch a
                    woman. I tried to remember which leader would and which wouldn't. Here and in
                    Pakistan, of course, everyone sticks out their hands as a way to say hello, as a
                    greeting. There I tried to curb that instinct. If they wanted to shake hands,
                    they would have to initiate the process and I would respond. I wondered what
                    power a 55 year-old woman could have that would impede some of these leaders
                    from shaking my hand! It was, of course, tradition that stood in the way. Some
                    of the younger American AID workers would become quite annoyed at the Afghan
                    treatment of womedemanding the covering of heads, arms, and legs, if not the
                    burqa. They wanted me to go with them because they thought that I added a
                    certain amount of presence and gravitas and if I didn't cover my arms in summer
                    they wouldn't have to either. But I tried to be on the conservative side and not
                    create an issue. I had no trouble dealing with Afghans, frankly. They had known
                    me from earlier incarnations and I was the wife of the American ambassador; and
                    I was well informed and serious about what I was doing. It was a job entirely
                    different from what I was used to; this was essentially field work - going out
                    and seeing and evaluating the situation “on the ground.” I made a lot of good
                    friends and I really enjoyed this aspect of the job.</p>
                <p>My duties as wife of the ambassador were relatively easy. The residence was
                    wonderful - it had been built in the late 1970s. It was very modern in a very
                    dramatic setting overlooking the Margala Hills. It was in a compound that had
                    tennis courts, a swimming pool, a commissary, medical services, and apartments
                    for American personnel. I had traditionally opposed American compounds because
                    they tended to separate Americans from the local community, but for a lot of the
                    young embassy people it was an appropriate facility in a Muslim country. You
                    could see young women driving into the compound with white knuckles because they
                    had been subjected to so many rude remarks and sexual gestures by Pakistanis.
                    Whenever a truck driver - and others - saw a western woman, it was an
                    opportunity to behave inappropriately, to our western eyes. So when these young
                    people entered the compound, they could get into their jogging clothes and run
                    free, swim and sun bathe, play tennis and behave as they would in the States.
                    The compound was a refuge from the hostile and difficult atmosphere of the
                    streets.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I should mention that I had a very good household staff that made my job much
                    easier. These were “bearers” or butlers who carried on the old colonial
                    traditions - they wore turbaned hats and took great pride in their profession.
                    We had a very nice cook who had a red beard - he was a Haji. He and I would work
                    out menus and recipes. It seemed to me that we spent a lot of time worrying
                    about food, which in fact was dwarfed by the many larger social problemsuch as
                    refugees and poverty. We had a lot of small social occasions - lunches or
                    dinners. Several congressional delegations, or CODELs, came and then we would
                    have large receptions. One of the delegations was made up entirely of
                    congresswomen, while Benazir Bhutto was the Prime Minister. They wanted to show
                    their support for her. There were a lot of people interested in various aspects
                    of Pakistan and Afghanistan; so we had quite a few CODELs. Senators Pell,
                    Spector, Shelby, and Cranston were among the visitors.</p>
                <p>We had taken our yellow Labrador dog with us, named Swinburne. He found several
                    mates in Islamabad and had lots of offspring. We had two litters of puppies at
                    the residence. I remember Senator Cranston sitting in our beautiful garden,
                    designed by an American/Australian professional with long experience in Pakistan
                    thanks to the encouragement of a much earlier Ambassador, Art Hummel, playing
                    with puppies. He loved them.</p>
                <p>On weekends, I would play tennis once or twice. We had our own pool that I also
                    used on the weekend. There were not many social demands on me during the day.
                    Everyone in the diplomatic and Pakistan communities knew that I worked and I was
                    the envy of a lot of the diplomatic wives because without a job, life in
                    Islamabad was very quiet. If I had an official lunch that took longer than
                    normal, I would stay at the office a little longer in the evening. So it was
                    really a very nice existence. There was a lot of serious talk at the dinner or
                    lunch table. Benazir Bhutto and her husband would come quite often for small
                    dinners; Bob would be off talking with her and various guests and I would spend
                    hours with Bhutto's husband, Asef. He would speak of how much he had given up so
                    that his wife could be Prime Minister and how restrained he had to be in his
                    position. He was a “bubblehead!” They boarded their dog, a yellow Lab named
                    Sunny, with us for a while when they were moving into their residence. He was
                    the “lightest” person I have ever met; he had no concept of what it meant to
                    serve Pakistan or to help his wife serve the country. He was always consumed
                    with his own “problems.”</p>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes. After her second reelection, the Bhuttos went wild with corruption
                    by all reports. They were somewhat corrupt, or at least he was, while we were
                    there. A lot of Pakistanis complained to us about what she and her husband were
                    doing. Benazir and Asef were accused of taking a healthy cut of the government's
                    procurement expenditures as kickbacks. The share was considered to be beyond the
                    limit in South Asia. I have always said that it is very hard to understand the
                    limits of corruption - what is acceptable or when it is over the limit - in
                    another country. Europeans never understood Nixon and his impeachment; our
                    rationales were beyond their understanding and the practices in their countries.
                    So I didn't know when “corruption” in Pakistan or other foreign countries went
                    too far and what was acceptable practice. But clearly the Bhuttos exceeded the
                    norms.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Bhutto as a Prime

                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think she was a disappointment. She had a wonderful academic background
                    - Harvard and Oxford. As head of the Pakistan's People Party, she would say all
                    the right things about democracy and the rights of people, and it is true that
                    she had to contend with traditional power centers - e.g. the landowners - and
                    therefore had a difficult row to hoe, but she was simply not as effective as one
                    would have hoped. She just wanted to retain power. In the end, President Khan
                    dismissed her - an entirely legal act under the Pakistani constitution. That
                    forced another election, which brought Nawaz Sharif to power. He came in also
                    with great hopes. Everybody thought he would be more effective than his
                    predecessor but in the end, he too fell. After we had departed, Bhutto was
                    reelected to her second term and the charges of corruption grew and grew,
                    accompanied by a general feeling of dissatisfaction with her regime. She was
                    followed by Sharif again; he was finally ousted in a military coup by General
                    Musharraf.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I was there from the beginning of 1989 to mid-1991. By spring of 1991, we
                    knew that Bob's three year tour was coming to a close and I began to look for an
                    assignment in Washington and I was offered several positions. Then Peter
                    Burleigh called one day asking me to become a deputy in INR. That was more than
                    I had expected; I thought it was just a terrific offer. I didn't know too much
                    about the “intelligence” aspect of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research; what
                    I knew I had learned on the Afghan desk and by watching the CIA work in Pakistan
                    and other posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Our daughter was married in the summer of 1989 and was expecting a child in 1991.
                    I had arranged her wedding from Pakistan; it was wonderful but not the smoothest
                    operation imaginable because we didn't have a base for such an event back in the
                    States and we only got home a week before. So there were several reasons why I
                    wanted to stay in the U.S. for a while; I had done my bit for AID. I think I was
                    helpful to the Afghanistan operation, especially in explaining to CODELs what we
                    were doing for Afghanistan to improve governance and unity and how the Afghan
                    Interim Government could operate. I specifically remember Senator Gordon
                    Humphrey's (R-NH) visit; he was a leading hawk on Afghanistan. I think it was
                    very hard for him and for everyone to understand why the Afghan Interim
                    Government couldn't get moving. They, of course, would point to the lack of
                    resources - e.g. we hadn't given them enough money. We would point out that we
                    had not seen sufficient evidence that they could manage those resources to good
                    effect. For example, there had been an earthquake in eastern Afghanistan. We
                    thought that would at least bring the seven leaders together so that a certain
                    amount of assistance could be cooperatively distributed to all the victims.
                    Well, I went to Peshawar and attended meeting after meeting, which went on
                    interminably. They (the seven leaders) wouldn't accept anybody else's
                    suggestions; all they wanted was that the resources be allocated to each leader
                    individually, and they promised to distribute them fairly to their people but
                    without any reference to others. Their positions and attitudes were enough to
                    make one pull one's hair.</p>

                        interim regime that might have been more responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: In a way, yes. The largest number of refugees who left Afghanistan during
                    the war went to Germany, followed by the U.S. and a few other places. Generally,
                    these people were bright, educated, modern individuals who had had the advantage
                    of various educational programs as well as close contact with the West. But when
                    they returned, they were submerged in traditional leadership and unable to
                    operate. In retrospect, this group of young well-educated people would have been
                    far better off working for Najubullah. They would have been able to make a far
                    more important contribution at that time to Afghanistan's development.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Not seriously because the consensus or conventional wisdom was that he
                    would not be able to hang on. During 1990 and 1991, it was thought that he could
                    not last much longer and that the interim government would eventually come to
                    power in Kabul. It was wishful thinking, in retrospect. But at the time, it
                    seemed quite reasonable and our views were encouraged by the Pakistanis, who I
                    think may well have been playing a double game. It suited them in some ways to
                    keep the Afghan situation unsettled. It kept the Pashtunistan threat at bay, as
                    well as other things. I wish now that we had done things differently. I am not
                    sure that even had we done so, it would have had a major impact on subsequent
                    events. Sometime, we overestimate our power of influence. In the final analysis,
                    the future of Afghanistan had to be determined by its people and not outside
                    powers.</p>
                <p>A lot of non-governmental organizations got started or expanded in the aftermath
                    of the Soviet invasion. The Vietnamese situation had first stimulated interest
                    in refugees; that was followed by the Afghan problems. From the mid-1970s, the
                    U.S. government developed a Refugee Resettlement Program, which allowed us to
                    admit to the U.S. certain refugee categories - generally with ties to the U.S.
                    such as former political leaders or government officials. It made us feel good
                    and gave those refugees a safe haven. Unnoticed - or at least not discussed -
                    was another impact of that program. It, in fact, removed from Afghanistan a
                    whole class of modern, educated Afghans. If they had stayed in the area and
                    agitated for a competent government, that might have changed the course of
                    history. Of course I can't blame the refugees, because of their own safety and
                    that of their families it would have been very difficult for them to reject
                    offers of safe haven in the U.S. or in Europe. Even if their lives were not in
                    danger, they had no jobs in Afghanistan and therefore their economic prospects
                    were far better in the West. But their departure left such a void in the
                    leadership class that it undoubtedly had an impact on the course of history. One
                    could say we did the same thing in Vietnam to a certain extent. For short-term,
                    valid reasons, actions were taken which may have contributed to authoritarian
                    regimes and unwelcome political situations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: No; at least as far as we knew. In the 1980s they had other fish to fry -
                    the Iraqis. They did not seem particularly interested in trying to dominate
                    their eastern flank. The Shia-Sunni split of course was ongoing. The Afghan Shia
                    were concentrated in the central mountainous part of Afghanistan; the Iranians
                    were interested in that part of Afghanistan, but couldn't reach it easily.
                    Sunnis lived closer to the Iranian border.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: That was very interesting, because Pakistan had for sometime enjoyed a
                    certain amount of free oil from Kuwait. Kuwait had also been very active in
                    assisting Afghan refugees. They had a very able ambassador in Pakistan and at
                    the beginning of the conflict, Pakistan gave full support to the U.S. and
                    Kuwait. When the Gulf War began, USIA sponsored various programs to discuss what
                    was happening in the Middle East and to test Pakistani attitudes. It became
                    clear that these attitudes were changing. From initial support, Pakistan moved
                    to growing opposition to what America was doing in Kuwait and Iraq. In looking
                    back, I think a lot of this change was due to agitation by the traditionalists
                    or fundamentalists - Arab conservatives who were aghast by the American presence
                    in “their” part of the world, particularly Saudi Arabia. Also, a lot of
                    Pakistanis had access to CNN; what they saw on that network provided
                    considerable fodder for conversation. In the early days of the Gulf War, CNN
                    focused on Israel and the threat that Iraq posed for that country - i.e., the
                    missiles. It was the only part of the Middle East to which CNN had ready access.
                    But the coverage gave the impression to a lot of CNN's Muslim viewers that all
                    the U.S. cared about was the protection of Israel. It never occurred to me that
                    this coverage would have such a negative effect in Pakistan. Then there was
                    repeated TV coverage of the amazing American military power. Pakistan became a
                    somewhat inhospitable place for Americans; we had an evacuation even though one
                    would have thought that when we came to Kuwait's rescue - a close Pakistani
                    friend - it would have been to our benefit. There were no links between Pakistan
                    and Iraq. Yet it became clear even before the serious bombardment of Iraq
                    started that we should evacuate dependants and employees who were not deemed
                    essential. The American School was closed and most people left. I stayed on with
                    the AID skeleton staff; we virtually ceased operations and we didn't go to
                    Peshawar. In fact, we didn't leave the compound until passions had cooled. I was
                    willing to be evacuated; I thought that this was what the decision-makers wanted
                    and I was not about to fight it. But some told me that I had to stay if no other
                    reason than to keep my husband under control! I was happy to do so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely, but I think it may have been an overreaction. But I did
                    witness demonstrations in Rawalpindi and Lahore and one could see in people's
                    eyes a wild irrationality. There was no way to predict how events would turn
                    out. One day, while running an errand in Rawalpindi with Bob's driver - I was
                    discouraged from driving myself because of the risks involved - I saw a mob
                    gathering. The driver said it was time to go home - pronto. My initial reaction
                    was to just drive around the scene; I thought we could bypass the problem and I
                    could finish my errands. But my better judgement rose to the fore and I
                    concluded that the driver was right and we hit the trail home.</p>

                <p>Within the first few weeks of my arrival in Pakistan, there had been a riot in
                    front of the American Cultural Center on the main street in Islamabad. This was
                    the result of the publication of Suleiman Rushdie's book and the reaction to it
                    by fundamentalists. The U.S. was really not involved, as it had been published
                    in the United Kingdom, but nevertheless we became the target and our staff
                    people were surrounded in the Cultural Center. Fortunately, the mob did not
                    close enough to the Center to do real damage, but there were a number of
                    Pakistanis killed in the melee. So there had been just enough anti-American
                    incidents to put everyone on edge during the Gulf War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you noticing the growth of a fundamentalist movement
                        in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes, but it was only in its beginning period and nothing compared to what
                    it became later. I think fundamentalism grew throughout the Arab world. I think
                    developments in Afghanistan were an important motivating factor, with the growth
                    of the Taliban, in part spawned by the madrasas in Pakistan. It was the failure
                    of the Pakistani government to deliver social services to the Pakistani public -
                    education, public health, transportation, etc. - year after year that certainly
                    played a large role in the expansion of fundamentalism, since people turned to
                    those who provided. The Pakistani government, of course, was always concerned
                    about India and therefore devoted large resources to its military capabilities,
                    which it couldn't afford. Most governments were also tied to traditional
                    pro-large-landlord policies - such as low taxes and no redistribution of
                    land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about Pakistan's view of India as
                        expressed to you by your Pakistani contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: In my view, most Pakistani views on India were irrational. We knew a lot
                    of people, of course, who had suffered in partition when their parents had been
                    forced out of various Indian provinces and areas. In addition, we knew people
                    who had been brought up in Bangladesh and who were bitter because they had not
                    been well treated by the Pakistani government. But almost all of our contacts
                    were irrational about India, I felt. That was particularly true for Pakistanis
                    in the military who were obsessed with India; India was not obsessed with
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>At one transitional point, Pakistan was led by Moen Qereshi, a former World Bank
                    official who made a real effort to reduce corruption and provide good
                    management. In his interim period, he did a lot of good work in collecting on
                    old loans for the government and reallocating resources from the military to the
                    social sector.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>So it could be done. By the time I left Pakistan, my greatest concern was that
                    population growth was going to overwhelm any possible economic growth - all the
                    statistics showed birth rates outstripping any increases in social services.
                    When Pakistan was created in 1947, it had 33 million people. By 1989, it was
                    over 100 million. Worst of all, investment in social services and infrastructure
                    - roads, power, schools, hospitals, etc. - had not nearly kept up with this
                    population explosion. It was out of control. The growth of fundamentalism made
                    it more difficult to deal with social problems, because of opposition from
                    certain mullahs, not to mention the reluctance of the government to make needed
                    investments. Any investments in the social sector had to come from outside. It
                    was not an effective national system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our assistance program have some inhibitions about
                        population programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: For Afghanistan, the emphasis was on helping women with maternal health
                    and safe deliveries. Because of the Afghan war, many people had died or had left
                    the country that there didn't seem to be the same kind of population pressure.
                    In addition, the conditions in Afghanistan, even in the best of times, were
                    harsh. It was and is one of the poorest countries in the world. So family
                    planning was not a priority in the Afghan program, but when some of us walked
                    through those refugee camps, we noticed hordes of little children and we became
                    concerned. I think we could have done a great deal more about family planning
                    for Afghans. I met many people later, when I was working on population, refugee,
                    and migration issues (I became much more knowledgeable and interested in the
                    issue), who pointed out to me the results of our failure to mount a population
                    program for Afghans. But in the late 1980s, it was not as much of a concern; the
                    view of most Afghans and Pakistanis was quite fatalistic - “Allah will provide.”
                    But there is no question that an Afghan family planning program would have been
                    useful; the demand was there. We had other priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a certain amount of frustration among embassy
                        and AID people that we were not doing enough about this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I've said, there had been quite a good family planning program in
                    Pakistan. It was not a question of changing views - it was simply meeting demand
                    for contraception at the basic level. In a society like Pakistan, abortion is
                    not a subject for discussion. The essence of a good family planning program is
                    contraception; various methods must be taught and the means provided. It
                    includes even such things as explaining reproduction to teenage girls, whose
                    education is the key to later marriages and less reproduction. There were so
                    many areas of reproductive health and population growth that needed to be dealt
                    with - abortion was really at the end of the line and did not need attention,
                    although I'm sure it went on.</p>
                <p>But as I said, I left feeling that Pakistan was a population time bomb.</p>

                        INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Right. I was one of four deputies, and responsible for regional analysis
                    or the geographic offices. The offices of INR organized along geographic lines -
                    following the regional bureaus - reported to me. As I mentioned before, I had
                    never worked with intelligence and therefore had a steep learning curve in order
                    to understand how the process operated, particularly daily production of the
                    intelligence summary for the secretary and other senior officials, called the
                    Secretary's Morning Summary [SMS], and the National Intelligence Daily [NID],
                    the CIA's daily publication. So I had to delve into a whole new world.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of experience in Africa and the Middle East; not very much in South
                    America or East Asia. I thought the job was fascinating. I met a whole new cast
                    of characters - NSA, CIA, DIA, NRO. It highlighted for me how wonderful Foreign
                    Service work is. It is a career which gives one the opportunity for a very wide
                    range of experience - in my case, from Afghan desk officer to congressional
                    affairs to spokesperson to Pakistan and then to the intelligence world. It was
                    very interesting, even with the very long hours required. I would have to go to
                    work both Saturday and Sunday every other weekend - we called it “setting the
                    book on Saturday and Sunday” - or giving final approval to the SMS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the information that was
                        flowing through your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: In 1991, Jim Baker was the secretary. He had brought Douglas Mulholland
                    in to head INR, whom he had known before at Treasury. Doug had worked at CIA,
                    had transferred to Treasury when Baker was Secretary there and handled
                    intelligence matters for him. I think Jim appointed Mulholland because he knew
                    him. Baker was not very interested in intelligence collection and analysis as
                    far as I could see.</p>
                <p>Mulholland had a very personal relationship with the Secretary, taking sensitive
                    materials up to him personally. He ran the office in a highly compartmentalized
                    manner and I did not get far beyond my immediate responsibilities. I was doing
                    broad regional analysis; we had a lot of meetings and weekly briefings with the
                    British, Canadians, and Australians. The amount of information that flowed in
                    seemed never ending and incredible to me but what I dealt with was not very
                    sensitive. Phil Wilcox was the senior deputy. I didn't have much contact with
                    the seventh floor and there were highly classified materials, particularly on
                    sources and methods, to which I did not have access.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>The job was largely editing and managerial. I did not write papers or memoranda
                    but directed and called for their production, massaging and editing what was
                    sent up to me, slowly getting better, I think. Doug was a real stickler for
                    brevity. He would cut out whole paragraphs and did not allow extraneous material
                    or background to be included in papers. I enjoyed my tour because I had access
                    to so much information and because I met so many fine people, not only on our
                    staff, but from other agencies and foreign counterparts both in Washington or in
                    their own countries.</p>
                <p>There was one thing that I didn't like about the job. I thought it was mainly
                    process, very much like the spokesperson's job - information in, information
                    ouOne did not have the sense of accomplishment that I had felt working on the
                    Afghan desk or for AID. There was no opportunity for initiative, creativity, or
                    developing and selling a policy approach. In operational jobs, you can take an
                    idea, push it through, and then see the results of your efforts. That didn't
                    happen in INR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that also you didn't have a chance to see where
                        your work was leading in policy terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: The issue of looking at the future has always been a challenge for the
                    State Department. There is a problem of how far ahead one can or should look. I
                    think a lot of people felt, and I understand their view, that we did more
                    explanation than prediction. People would find out after the fact why certain
                    events took placProjections are risky. CIA in its analysis often would provide a
                    range of predictions, possible outcomes, or possibilities. It felt that once it
                    provided this analysis, its task was complete. But in the Department we were
                    much closer to the policy process; we had to give some indication of the most
                    likely possibility or outcome because the decision makers had to have some feel
                    for the consequences of their actions. Sometimes what we did was quite clear.
                    If, for example, someone took action contrary to what the U.S. had been told, we
                    could voice our displeasure. But so many of the issues we faced were much
                    murkier. Decision makers wanted to know what was likely to happen under various
                    circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>When I was in INR, from 1991 to 1993, a great deal of attention was devoted to
                    Bosnia and Yugoslavia as they disintegrated. I was surprised how many people
                    knew Yugoslavia. INR had some top-notch analysts working on this area. They
                    finally came to question the impact of the intelligence analysis they were
                    producing. They had been predicting disintegration, but there was no political
                    will in the government to take preventive action. People were stuck in their
                    mindsets as to what was possible. It was an election period; Baker had had
                    enough overseas involvement after the Gulf War. He was inclined to view
                    Yugoslavia as an European problem to be resolved by them. Eagleburger, who was
                    the deputy secretary, had a major influence on our Balkan policy and he was
                    firmly opposed to U.S. involvement. So our policy essentially developed into a
                    damage limitation effort. Then Germany recognized Croatia and the disintegration
                    spiraled further downward. All of the analysts kept waiting for Kosovo to blow
                    up, in light of the ethnic persecution there.</p>
                <p>As time passed, the analysts became more and more demoralized because they had
                    foreseen and predicted all of the disintegration, but the policy makers paid no
                    attention to them. I have said that, in retrospect, had policymakers paid more
                    attention to their warnings, we might have taken a different posture. We might
                    not have able to stop the disintegration, but we might have insisted on a
                    peaceful dissolution of Yugoslavia and Bosnia. There could have been the
                    establishment of an independent Croatia, an independent Serbia, an independent
                    Slovenia and even perhaps an independent Kosovo through mediation and political
                    dialogue. Eventually, we did try to stop the fighting, but it was much later
                    than it needed to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues which interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: There weren't many European issues. The change from Soviet Union to
                    Russia was an on going process. Haiti was a hot issue - and Somalia. On the
                    latter, the focus was on the humanitarian side, because we no longer had an
                    embassy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the CIA reporting useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I never felt that the Agency's analysis was as good as ours, and many of
                    the CIA senior officials agreed. The Agency had too many layers; its analysis
                    was very cautious, filled with caveats. On the other hand, they dealt much more
                    with military and technical matters we were just not equipped to handle - nor
                    was INR ever expected to handle.</p>
                <p>As I have said, the closeness of the relationship between the Secretary and the
                    INR Assistant Secretary is clearly seen and is very important. It is a very
                    important element for an effective INR head. Mort Abramowitz was very close to
                    Shultz. Hal Saunders was very close to Kissinger. But Doug Mulholland was never
                    closely connected with Baker's policy process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baker apparently relied just on a small group of advisors,
                        which focused on a few key matters and left the rest for the Department to
                        struggle with. Yugoslavia apparently fell into the latter category.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think all of that is true. In addition, it was not in Mulholland's
                    nature to force his way into the secretary's suite and insist that he pay more
                    attention to INR's analysis. And the whole foreign policy process was overtaken
                    by the American political situation; i.e. stay out of trouble in the election
                    period of 1992.</p>
                <p>I should note that I have not discussed my first tour in INR to the same extent
                    that I did my work in Pakistan or other assignments. I was there for only two
                    years whereas my other assignments were usually for three years. As I noted
                    before, my conclusion was that an INR deputy's role was not that of analysis,
                    but rather the management of a process - making sure that all pertinent
                    information was flowing to us from the many intelligence sources in the U.S.
                    government, and asking the right questions to elicit the right information. It
                    was frustrating to see how little use was made by the policy makers of the
                    intelligence analyses provided them. In addition, deputies had to spend time on
                    other management issues like personnel - assignments, EEO, morale, and
                    harassment. I had 50 to 60 analysts working for me; their management and their
                    replacements were a full-time job. Some cases had to go to a review board; that
                    tied one's hands even after the case was closed, because often the analyst could
                    not be moved. Civil servants become entrenched in the bureaucracy; they wouldn't
                    and couldn't be moved to other assignments. INR's staff came primarily from the
                    civil service and that raised tremendous problems because their promotional
                    opportunities were very limited. In the past, management did not have to worry
                    if it had a highly regarded analyst; he or she could be promoted without
                    changing jobs. But that is not allowed under today's rules. So you are caught by
                    the desire to keep that analyst and his or her need for a promotion. Without the
                    opportunity for greater income, the analyst becomes frustrated and leaves. So
                    management of civil servants was a very complicated matter, particularly when it
                    came to firing or reassignment. I think that senior managers in the Department
                    must come to grips with this problem; there must an opportunity for advancement
                    even if the nature of the job doesn't change. The opportunity in INR to mix
                    civil servants and Foreign Service officers was a real plus; the latter brought
                    a different perspective that was really healthy. In the period of 1991-1993, INR
                    was not under as much pressure to reduce its budget as in later periods.</p>
                <p>Baker left in early 1992 to become the Bush campaign manager. A lot of people
                    said if he had assumed that role earlier, Bush's campaign might have been
                    different, and better, and Bush might have won. In November, 1992 Clinton won
                    the election. The bureaucracy then began to prepare for a new administration -
                    in early 1993 Warren Christopher became Secretary of State. He brought a lot of
                    new faces into the Department. Toby Gotti was appointed head of INR. I stayed
                    until new deputies were appointed. Jim Steinberg was my successor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the change in administrations go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think changes are always a little messy. There is a period when there
                    are more questions than answers. Who would be the next INR assistant secretary?
                    Then, who would he or she appoint as deputies? I think the Clinton people took a
                    greater interest in the appointments of deputies than most other
                    administrations; they were interested in diversity and placing many new people
                    but it was not a very well organized effort. It was my intention to leave; a new
                    chief should select his or her own deputies; furthermore, I thought it was time
                    to move on and do something else. I liked my tour in INR, although it was not my
                    favorite assignment in the Foreign Service. I must say that the new
                    administration's people were not at all shy or very polite about telling people
                    that their time was up!</p>
                <p>One of the interesting aspects of the Department's changeover was the arrival of
                    this slew of new people who came with Christopher, including Tim Wirth - former
                    senator from Colorado who was appointed as the new Under Secretary for Global
                    Affairs (an office designated as “G”). I remember that in early 1993, the
                    Clinton people were scurrying around looking for Foreign Service officers,
                    particularly women. I was asked by Wirth whether I would be interested in
                    working on human rights, democracy and labor. I really was not because those
                    issues had never been front and center in my interests. So I didn't think that
                    would be a good fit. Then he asked whether I would be interested in working in
                    the refugee bureau as the deputy director, and that was a lot more
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you in 1993, after your INR tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: As I said, a new administration took office in 1993. This was a
                    Democratic administration after Republicans had occupied the White House for
                    twelve years. So there was a “clean sweep” mentality among the newcomers, which
                    was fine by me because after two years in INR, although the subject matter was
                    fascinating, I was ready to move on.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that I had been offered a couple of jobs by Tim Wirth. He came to the
                    Department as a committed environmentalist and supporter of family planning.
                    With all his Congressional experience, he knew the private, non-governmental
                    world of NGOs and activists, and was very knowledgeable about many aspects of
                    the issues that he was expected to handle, and he was energetic and determined.
                    I liked him from the first time I met him. I saw the energy and I thought that
                    working for him would be a lot of fun. Wirth had been a senator; he had come to
                    Congress in what was called the “Class of 1974” - a group that had opposed the
                    Vietnam War and which was eager to see reforms enacted. They were “Young Turks”
                    who had held out a lot of hope for Bobby Kennedy, but after his assassination,
                    it took them a long time to rise to power. It was a remarkable group of
                    Congressmen.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Tim had decided that he didn't want to run for the Senate again. I think he hoped
                    to be appointed as Secretary of Energy or Secretary of Interior. That didn't
                    happen, primarily because of the Clinton's administration emphasis on diversity;
                    the energy job went to a woman. So he was offered the Global Under Secretaryship
                    at State.</p>
                <p>The offer that Tim made to me was Deputy Director of the Office of Refugee
                    Affairs or Principal Deputy. The director then was Warren Zimmermann, whom I
                    didn't know personally, although I was familiar with his reputation because had
                    been our ambassador to Yugoslavia and he had also worked on many European
                    issues. He had been the refugee office director for about a year when the
                    administration changed. His main focus in 1993 was Bosnia, the major relief
                    effort that had started in 1991. Warren is a fine, wonderful man - a consummate
                    diplomat, a man of principle. I think he would have preferred to be our
                    ambassador in Moscow or to some other Eastern European post where he would have
                    worked more closely on longstanding issues of personal interest. He was
                    nevertheless very interested in the fate of refugees.</p>
                <p>I became the principal deputy in September, 1993 and served under G, or Wirth,
                    until 1997. I think there was always the understanding that if and when Warren
                    left, I would assume the duties of office director. In Tim's reorganization of
                    the Under Secretary's office, the Office of Refugee Affairs became a bureau by
                    adding population to refugee and migration issues. So Warren's successor was to
                    be the first assistant secretary of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and
                    Migration. One of the reasons the office could be upgraded to bureau was because
                    the Office of Population Affairs was added to it. Tim Wirth felt passionately
                    about population issues and I think his reorganization was backed by the White
                    House, that wanted to make it more of a political issue and not just
                    development. As you may remember, one of Clinton's first acts was to reverse our
                    position on “Mexico City language.” That is a complicated issue, but essentially
                    it barred U.S. government funds from being allocated to international family
                    planning organizations which espoused international family planning if that
                    organization's work included support for abortion - even if those programs were
                    funded by other resources and conducted where abortion was legal. The
                    restriction had been first put in place by Reagan at a conference on women held
                    in Mexico City - and hence the name.</p>
                <p>AID traditionally had been the lead agency on population programs and therefore
                    U.S. policy, working with both NGOs and international organizations. Tim felt
                    that the issue was more important and broader than just implementation, and that
                    the Department had to become the main policy making engine on family planning.
                    The Clinton administration was soon to participate in an international
                    conference to be held in Cairo in the fall of 1994 on population and development
                    and was beginning to plan for it. Tim was building toward that important
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>He had already selected Faith Mitchell, a woman from California, to head that
                    part of the Bureau dealing with family planning. She came out of the NGO world
                    and had a strong background in women's health. I certainly didn't have any
                    background on these issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>The Bureau of Refugee Affairs had grown out of our experiences with Vietnamese
                    refugees. What we had done earlier to support UNRWA or UNHRC had been done
                    through the UN; i.e. through IO. When the Vietnamese refugee issue began in
                    1970s - and continued into the late 1980s with the “boat people” - considerable
                    direct U.S. government involvement was called for to help these people, and the
                    separate office was created. This is also a very complicated issue. In 1993, we
                    were still working with the “boat people” - people who had fled Vietnam by ship
                    and initially had been refused refuge by several Asian countries. The Afghan
                    refugee program was also winding down. Then there was the Lautenberg Amendment,
                    which made it much easier for Jews and Evangelical Christians living in the
                    former Soviet Union to apply for refugee status in the U.S. So those were our
                    large programs.</p>
                <p>We also worked on a lot of migration issues with our European allies, involving
                    the large influx of former Yugoslav citizens, most of which was done illegally.
                    The real question was whether these people would ever return to their homes from
                    Western Europe when the dust settled in the Balkans.</p>
                <p>It was a new world for me. I had dealt with many of the NGOs and UNHCR when I was
                    the Afghanistan desk officer and was worrying about Afghan refugees. Also I had
                    seen many of these organizations in action when I was in Pakistan working with
                    the Afghan humanitarian program. The Bureau for Population, Refugees, and
                    Migration (PRM) had about 100 people, both from the Civil Service and Foreign
                    Service. A lot of Foreign Service officers were introduced to refugee problems
                    and work around the world in the course of their overseas tours and became
                    passionate about the problem. Furthermore, there were a number in the Bureau
                    who, mostly for family reasons, did not want to go overseas again - they
                    converted to Civil Service. So the bureau included a lot of very dedicated
                    people. We had the largest budgetary account in the Department, usually in the
                    range of $500-700 million. There were some devoted members of Congress who
                    decided that the bureau should be exempt from personnel ceilings imposed on
                    other parts of the Department; so we had our own staffing authority outside the
                    jurisdiction of the Department. After consultation with Congress, for example,
                    we could hire part-time or short-term people. Our freedom for action in the
                    personnel field made a lot of sense for sudden refugee and humanitarian
                    problems.</p>
                <p>As I said, I worked as the Senior Deputy for a little more than a year. By early
                    1993, it became clear that Warren Zimmermann would not be selected to be the
                    first assistant secretary of the new bureau. The administration was looking for
                    diversity; this was another time for me when it was useful to be a woman. There
                    just were not enough of them at the assistant secretary level in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it somewhat uncomfortable to appear to belong
                        to a “privileged” class?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: It was uncomfortable. I would have been more than happy to continue as
                    Warren's deputy - that would have suited me fine. But I think when he saw that
                    he would not be appointed as assistant secretary and that there was no other
                    senior assignment on the horizon, he decided to retire, despite the fact that he
                    was recognized as an outstanding officer who had served his government very
                    well. He began to teach at the New School in New York and then later at Columbia
                    University. I have heard that he is a great professor. I think he is now retired
                    again and working on a book about U.S. imperialism in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>There was an interesting side-play on the choice of Assistant Secretary: there
                    had been no political people who had put their names forward to head the new
                    bureau as refugees were just not politically “hot.” Wirth, I think, wanted me
                    for the job but soon ran into two problems - first of all, with addition of
                    responsibility for population, the bureau was becoming a more attractive spot.
                    The second concerned a woman from Arkansas, who had worked in Washington under
                    Carter as an assistant secretary in Agriculture, and had a good reputation, who
                    began to eye the job. But in the end her candidacy was aborted because she was
                    the sister of the governor of Arkansas, and he developed legal difficulties and
                    was indicted. Then she was no longer politically attractive!</p>
                <p>At that point, a wonderful thing happened to me. Meg Greenfield, the editor of
                    the editorial page of The Washington Post and a good friend, heard about the
                    political competition for PRM. She wrote an editorial saying that the bureau
                    already had on its staff a real professional woman who was well qualified and
                    that she thought it was most unfortunate that others were being considered to be
                    assistant secretary, particularly outsiders who had very little if any knowledge
                    of refugee affairs. I think that editorial had a tremendous impact. At the same
                    time, a rumor began to float around the Department - I never knew how it got
                    started - to the effect that I had made some negative comments about Warren
                    Christopher at a dinner party. Vernon Jordan allegedly had heard these comments.
                    Now Vernon was a good friend of mine; we lived in the same general neighborhood
                    and had played tennis together. One day, I saw him in the hall of the Department
                    and told him about the rumor. He said he would take care of it; I think he went
                    straight in to talk to someone on the seventh floor and that was the end of the
                    rumor.</p>
                <p>I found the selection process to be quite fascinating because I had never seen
                    such an interplay between those who worked on political placement and Foreign
                    Service politics. In the end, given all the politics, I was almost surprised but
                    very pleased when I became the administration's candidate for the Assistant
                    Secretaryship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the selection process, was there a lot of support for
                        Zimmermann?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: I don't remember that being much of a factor. He was obviously
                    disappointed at not being selected, but I think he was really ready for a
                    change. Certainly I made no moves to put myself forward at his expense or anyone
                    else's; as I said, I would have been very happy to be his principal deputy. In
                    fact, I thought that was what would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with confirmation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I had no problems. They asked me the usual questions about my experience.
                    I did have one advantage in that my husband had appeared before the same Senate
                    committee for his confirmation hearings. So we had all the necessary records
                    about domestic servants that we had employed, Social Security payments we had
                    made for them and tax returns. He also had filed financial disclosure
                    statements; so the committee already knew a lot about us. I did tell Wendy
                    Sherman, the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, that one of our
                    neighbors had once complained about our dogs - they allegedly barked too much.
                    The police were called but dismissed the complaint. When the young officer came
                    to the door with her complaint, my mother-in-law answered and told her that we
                    hardly mistreated our dogs - we even slept with them! But I had no problems with
                    confirmation.</p>
                <p>By this time, we had lost a great refugee champion in the Senate - Mark Hatfield.
                    I had called on him when I first began to work on refugee issues because he was
                    so vitally interested in this issue and really had to give his approval. He had
                    been a real champion for our causes and protected our appropriations.</p>
                <p>Two days after being sworn in in a brief ceremony in early September, 1994, I
                    left for Cairo for the UN Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). That
                    was a real experience. Our delegation was filled with political appointees,
                    NGOs, members of Congress, and representatives of various departments. The Vice
                    President came through Cairo for a brief appearance at the conference. Tim Wirth
                    was there with a number of his former congressional staffers, who continued to
                    work for him in many ways. There were numerous NGOs in attendance at a parallel,
                    non-governmental conference. It was a huge affair.</p>
                <p>There had been a great deal of preparatory work at the UN so that the draft
                    resolution would be acceptable to the broad range of interests represented in
                    Cairo. The negotiating process in the UN is very complicated, with bracketed
                    language when there is disagreement. The wording on teenagers, abortion,
                    maternal health, and on what assistance should be provided by the developed
                    world became key to success by one side or the other. I must say that my
                    experiences with these resolutions made me wonder after they were drafted what
                    their meaning really was. But there were a lot of tough negotiations on language
                    - it is very interesting that the Iranians, who had been hit by a population
                    explosion, became quite amenable and helpful to our efforts to prevent
                    restrictive language on reproductive health and family planning.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Our problems were primarily with Muslim regimes governed by fundamentalists and
                    with those governments on which the Catholic Church had strong influence, like
                    many in Latin America. Some chose to take a hard line; others did not. China was
                    very sensitive about its one child policy, which had been widely criticized. So
                    there were many currents at play in Cairo.</p>
                <p>We were there for two weeks. I left for a few days to fly to Addis Ababa for a
                    conference on refugee problems in Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. But the two
                    weeks were full of negotiations, meetings, receptions, and exhibitions. In the
                    end, I think everyone on the American delegation felt we had achieved as much as
                    we could have hoped in moving nations toward agreed goals. We worked with a lot
                    of other countries and organizations that were as interested in and as
                    passionate about the necessity for family planning in economic development as we
                    were. The Scandinavians were the most liberal block, and with the Dutch, kept up
                    pressure from that perspective. By the end of the conference, I think the
                    majority of the delegations felt we had made real progress in supporting family
                    planning and education on reproductive health issues. There was also a consensus
                    that the developed world had responsibility for providing the necessary
                    resources so that less developed countries could conduct family planning
                    programs. Abortion was not really an issue.</p>
                <p>The American delegation thought that from our perspective the conference came out
                    well. No doubt it was primarily due to Tim Wirth's work. Based on his
                    experiences as a senator, he was well equipped to deal with outside
                    constituencies, whether on the environment or population. He enlisted the advice
                    of outside groups in forming the U.S. delegation, which consisted of government
                    professionals as well, experienced in how international conferences are run and
                    how UN negotiations are conducted, and of others who knew the NGO world. We all
                    worked well together and the final document included language that we felt very
                    good about. Of course, there is the fair question whether language in a UN
                    document changes the real world. It doesn't, but it did put countries on record.
                    Since 1994, there have been various efforts made to rollback the language of the
                    Cairo document. Catholic countries, which are very heavily influenced by the
                    Vatican on questions of abortion and family planning, and some Muslim countries
                    who take a very rigid and restrictive view on women's issues, have tried to move
                    back from their Cairo commitments. As I mentioned before, some of our closest
                    collaborators were the Iranians who had gone through a period of rapid
                    population growth and then experienced the consequences on their societal
                    infrastructure. When we returned to Washington, we had to face the issue of
                    implementation of the agreed policies - it is much harder to get money than
                    write a set of principles.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>I should certainly at this point make mention of the refugee crises of the 1990s.
                    There had been earlier huge refugee problems, starting with the Vietnamese. The
                    U.S. government and the predecessors of the PRM bureau organized themselves to
                    address that particular challenge. Efforts were well coordinated among the
                    Department of Health and Human Services, INS, State Department, and UN agencies.
                    That became the model for later efforts. Then came the Afghan problem in the
                    early '80s; that was not so much an issue of resettlement as it was a matter of
                    feeding and housing a displaced mass of people, well over two million. We had to
                    work closely with Pakistan, which set itself up bureaucratically to direct and
                    organize the assistance.</p>
                <p>At the end of the Gulf War, the U.S. faced the question of Iraqi refugees. Then
                    came the Balkans, Bosnia particularly, which again was more a relief effort than
                    a resettlement problem. So the 1990s were a period of great effort on refugees
                    and humanitarian assistance.</p>
                <p>The PRM bureau in the Department, that had the lead role on these issues, was a
                    very new one. As noted earlier, the functions started in IO, then became an
                    office and in 1994 a bureau, and I was the first Assistant Secretary. PRM had
                    many Foreign Service officers who became so engaged with refugee and assistance
                    work that they converted to Civil Service in order to stay in the bureau and
                    with the work. We needed that kind of built-in expertise, particularly on
                    program management. We had the largest operational budget in the State
                    Department, which was earmarked by Congressional mandate. We handled close to
                    $700 million per annum; we had to make sure that the money was well spent and
                    every penny accounted for. We all took satisfaction that no problems ever arose
                    over our management of those funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little more about the Rwanda refugee
                        problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: This occurred in the summer of 1995 and was a relief effort, not a
                    resettlement one. By the mid-'90s there was throughout the world a group of very
                    capable and experienced NGOs who had handled many refugee crises. Leadership
                    rested with the UNHCR, led by Mrs. Ogato, a Japanese woman of incredible
                    strength and ability who was UNHCR's head. Usually, in a refugee or humanitarian
                    crisis of any magnitude, one UN agency is appointed the lead agency. Someone has
                    to be responsible for pulling all the other efforts together, although that is a
                    major challenge when it comes to the NGOs who thrive on their independence. I
                    think that is particularly true of foreign NGOs; I think American NGOs have
                    learned that their efforts will be much more successful if there is a
                    coordinator working to reduce the chaos which always seems to be present at the
                    beginning of a refugee problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>In Rwanda, the UNHCR had the lead role. UNICEF did a lot of work, particularly on
                    water issues. WHO assisted, as did the World Food Program, which provided food.
                    There had been considerable amounts of foodstuffs stored in Ethiopia because of
                    the systemic famines and crises that had arisen in the Horn of Africa. So some
                    food was readily available in a near-by country. The U.S. Army brought in huge
                    black trailers which held “water bladders” - huge rubber containers for water.
                    The French also were involved in providing water supplies.</p>
                <p>The Hutu refugees started pouring out of Rwanda, first into Tanzania, and in July
                    into eastern Zaire. About July 14, I flew out to see the crisis with Secretary
                    of Defense Perry, General Jowlon on EUCON, Nan Borton of OFDA, and Julia Taft of
                    Interaction, the NGO coordinating organization. When we landed in Goma, we were
                    welcomed very formally - in the old French tradition - by Zairians. They thought
                    this was my first visit and I pointed out to them that in fact I had lived in
                    their country for three years! The assistance group that I will always remember
                    was the San Francisco Fire Department's pumping unit. They had been flown to
                    Zaire. UNHCR had developed an air cell in Geneva that handled air traffic
                    management for all of the planes going in and out of Goma. There were no
                    hangars, fuel was scarce, and people got only a certain amount of time on the
                    apron and then had to leave, and they did leave. No planes were allowed to land
                    until the runways and aprons had been cleared. It was an amazing operation.</p>
                <p>We flew over refugee encampments on lava fields around Goma where there were more
                    people milling about than I had ever seen. Jerry cans were being filled with
                    water. One could see everywhere the ubiquitous UN blue sheeting that had been
                    given to the refugees to make whatever shelter they could. Eventually, the UNHCR
                    got matters under control; the cholera epidemic was brought to a halt; bodies
                    were buried and survivors settled. It was a success story that I don't think
                    ever got the recognition it deserved.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of mistakes made; there always are in situations such as these.
                    The U.S. and others should have tried to stop the genocide in Rwanda and
                    provided assistance long before we did, but we were still suffering from our
                    experiences in Somalia and not anxious to become involved in another
                    humanitarian tragedy so soon - and not in the same way. President Clinton was
                    concerned politically about the potential loss of U.S. soldiers' lives as had
                    happened in Somalia. He has since admitted the U.S. should have done more.</p>
                <p>One of the major problems was security in the refugee camps. By international
                    practice, camp security is the responsibility of the host government. It wasn't
                    provided in eastern Zaire because the Zairian state was crumbling so fast in the
                    last years of Mobutu. I remembered what my husband had done when we needed more
                    security in Kinshasa. He essentially rented people from the Zairian army; we fed
                    them, clothed them, provided medical services, equipped them; in the final
                    analysis they worked for us. I suggested to Mrs. Ogato that that is what she
                    should do and eventually, that did it. She rented army units, gave them trailers
                    to sleep in and they acted as military police. They were a great help, although
                    they didn't meet all of the needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Q: I have heard that the Hutus used the camps as staging areas from which they
                    would mount their ethnic cleansing campaigns.</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Many of the Hutu fighters went further west into Zairian army camps,
                    taking equipment with them to be prepared to reenter Rwanda at a later time. One
                    could tell from the new boots worn by some of the young men in the refugee camps
                    that they were getting help and that there were elements in the refugee camps
                    determined to fight again. The consensus was that support came from Hutus living
                    abroad who had the resources to procure and distribute equipment.</p>
                <p>After the refugees were settled, attacks into western Rwanda continued. Kagame,
                    the leader of the victorious Tutsis in Rwanda, was a very smart and dedicated
                    leader. He felt that the refugees had to return to their homes and the camps had
                    to be closed down, eliminating the armed camps supporting the Hutus. Things got
                    so bad the Canadians almost intervened in December, 1995 as peacekeepers to try
                    to resolve the continuing raids and tribal conflicts. The UNHCR was trying to
                    disband the camps and to get the refugees to return home, but it was a slow
                    bureaucratic process. The government of Rwanda got impatient and when it
                    appeared that nothing would happen quickly with the camps. UNHCR on its side had
                    worked out complicated plans to use buses for repatriation with way stations
                    along the route, and a system to identify each refugee. This might have worked
                    under ideal circumstances. But the Rwandan government finally said that it
                    couldn't wait any longer for repatriation to start and just entered the camps,
                    telling the refugees to get going with only a rudimentary transportation system.
                    Most had to walk - they had walked out and could walk back home as distances
                    were short. They did not establish any way stations because they knew people
                    would stop and probably disappear. So their program called for a very quick
                    return of the refugees, back to their home villages. It was far from perfect,
                    but it did get the Rwandans home in record time with a minimum of fuss. I took
                    my hat off to them; in truth it would never have come about if they had followed
                    all the instructions that UNHCR and other international groups wanted to impose.
                    I talked all of this over when I went to Geneva for UNHCR meetings in October of
                    1996 and even UNHCR had to admit they were impressed by the speed and impact of
                    the repatriation operation, although critical of certain aspects. I got to know
                    some of the Rwandans very well and we had some fascinating discussions about how
                    they had managed the return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the aftermath work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Unfortunately, the aftermath is still ongoing. Eastern Zaire was and is
                    chaotic; there were many refugees who didn't want to return to Rwanda and they
                    moved further west into the forests. No one knew how many there were; in some
                    instances, some were massacred by locals and chaos ruled in a huge area. This
                    was happening as Mobutu's rule was coming to an end, with the country
                    splintering; there was no Zairian government presence to control groups that
                    continued to raid western Rwanda or to move into Uganda. All of these factors
                    allowed forces from Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Angola and Zimbabwe to move into
                    Zaire. This chaos was called the “first world war” in Africa. In the last couple
                    of years, there have been discussions of and some attempts at UN peacekeeping,
                    but there is still no peace to keep in eastern Zaire.</p>
                <p>I don't want to take too much time on the Rwandan situation, but it did show the
                    consequences of a chaotic situation in the absence of effective governmental
                    control. You must contrast eastern Zaire to the situation in Tanzania where
                    there was an effective government and organized refugee return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did European countries contribute? There are many who take
                        credit for whatever little was accomplished.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Many countries and people contributed, and we never had any difficulty
                    working with them. Usually those in the field or in Geneva were people that I
                    had known for sometime. The challenge that continues to hamper international
                    efforts to ease humanitarian situations is the availability of adequate
                    resources. The U.S. (followed by the EU and Japan) has always been the largest
                    donor to UNHCR. We have always provided more to UN food programs than any other
                    country. Congress earmarked certain funds to be paid to the ICRC (International
                    Committee of the Red Cross) and has kept up those contributions. Representatives
                    of some of these international organizations would complain to me that they were
                    having troubles with the Europeans who were not paying what they used to. There
                    is clearly donor fatigue in the international donor community. Resources for a
                    new crisis came rather easily but public interest wanes before the problem is
                    really solved. A new crisis arises which piques public interest, often in part
                    stimulated by NGOs who in the last few years have learned how to garner
                    publicity and public support. They demand that governments shift attention from
                    old problems to new ones. Look at Angola and Somalia - situations that have
                    never been resolved and where humanitarian needs still exist. But now there
                    isn't much public clamor for U.S. involvement in those places.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, refugee crises were not in Africa - they were in Vietnam,
                    Afghanistan, and Iraq. These were situations that resulted primarily from the
                    Cold War and anti-communism. But in the 1990s, refugees in Africa had come to
                    the forefront of humanitarian concern. Countries are no longer as welcoming to
                    refugees as they used to be. I think that about 25% of all Africans fall into
                    the refugee category; that is an astounding statistic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I view the problems in Europe as migration issues, not refugee problems.
                    Mass movements of illegal immigrants are caused by societies that can not offer
                    any economic opportunities, particularly to young men who are determined to rise
                    economically and who are aware of better lives that exist in other countries.
                    This is a growing problem, stimulated by population pressure plus the
                    information revolution that makes information available to most - through TV,
                    computers, and VCRs. Everyone thinks they know what life is like elsewhere.
                    Kurds, Moroccans, Africans from the Sahel, etc., are all pushing on Europe,
                    especially on that part that Winston Churchill described as “the soft
                    underbelly.” We get the same pressure from Mexico. It is no surprise the
                    economically wealthy countries are the first and most desirable targets.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: We are really talking about two things. Our humanitarian assistance
                    programs in place, particularly for Africa, grew year after year. Refugee
                    resettlement in a third country is another issue. According to U.S. law and
                    international norms, a person who wishes to be designated as a refugee must
                    demonstrate he or she has a well founded fear of persecution based on race,
                    religion, nationality, or political or social affiliation, on an individual
                    basis, if returned to the country of origin. The standard goes beyond the
                    general and the threat has to be definite and concrete. The U.S. has established
                    criteria for the screening of potential refugees, including what must be
                    demonstrated as proof, and the countries they come from; when approved they are
                    brought to the U.S. for resettlement. Most African refugees left their homes
                    because their leaders instructed them to; e.g. the Hutus pouring out of Rwanda.
                    In that situation, for the first time in anyone's memory, the perpetrators of
                    genocide lost the confrontation. The Tutsis reconquered the country and the
                    Hutus fled. So individual Hutus did not qualify for refugee status in the U.S.
                    because they did not have a well-founded fear of persecution - they had been the
                    persecutors.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>There are other situations were refugee status is granted in Africa. Recently, as
                    discussed in The New York Times magazine section, there was the saga of the
                    “lost boys” of the southern Sudan. These were young men who had been caught up
                    for a decade of fighting between the North and the South; they wandered from
                    place to place as the fighting moved around. They went into Ethiopia and then
                    returned to the Sudan and then fled to Kenya - all on foot. There are about
                    10,000 of these boys in Kenya - most of them illiterate, with many who have
                    never seen a water faucet or a toilet bowl. The challenge of bringing to the
                    U.S. such a group, who have never had an opportunity at anything resembling home
                    life, is huge, as you can well imagine. They need to be taught all the
                    fundamentals of living and then how to become economically self-sufficient in
                    American society. I think all these migration and refugee issues are going to
                    become increasingly difficult. When Afghans came to the U.S., they were mostly
                    from an educated class and the same is true for refugees from the Soviet Union.
                    The Vietnamese had a more difficult adaptation process, but most of them managed
                    it very well with strong families. The ones that have problems are primarily
                    illiterate or from tribes and therefore only accustomed to a very small clan.
                    They have the hardest time making the adjustment.</p>
                <p>Each refugee-migrant case was and is a story in itself. You can't generalize
                    about refugees or migrants - all cases are unique.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: The humanitarian relief system for Bosnia was established by the time I
                    came on board in 1993, but there were other incidents later which created
                    problems. There was increasing Serb near-genocide, as illustrated by events in
                    Srebrenica when the Serbs separated out the men and slaughtered most of theI
                    flew to Europe immediately, and traveled from Geneva to the troubled area by
                    helicopter with Mrs. Ogata. There were masses of women who had been bused to the
                    airstrip; they lined up in front of Red Cross tables to give the names of the
                    missing. There was hope at the time that the missing men were being held in
                    captivity and would eventually be released unharmed. In a few weeks, it became
                    clear that most of these men had been killed. It was an amazing, heartbreaking
                    experience. Mrs. Ogata was absolutely terrific; she would wander from group to
                    group and then sit down to talk. The registration system began to work fairly
                    rapidly, so that we knew the magnitude of the problem relatively soon. Supplies
                    began to arrive. It was mid-summer and it was very hot; relief workers were
                    setting up tents for these refugees so that they could at least escape the
                    sun.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>There was one incident that I have treasured. I was sitting with a group of
                    women, trying to learn of their experiences, and I started the conversation by
                    asking how much time they had been given to evacuate their houses. What had they
                    done about food? Were they able to bring anything with them? It was particularly
                    difficult for those with small children. The conversation went on and on. When
                    it was over and we were dispersing, the interpreter said to me that the women
                    wanted me to know that they liked my shoes! That was a very sophisticated,
                    European reaction. It told me that those women were still alive and “with it;”
                    while they would not make a comment like that directly to me because it might
                    have sounded frivolous, they had taken notice.</p>
                <p>After I left the bureau, Kosovo erupted, and a million and a half people fled.
                    Never had there been such a rapid exodus, followed by such a rapid return, all
                    within a four or five month period. People were critical of U.S. and other
                    relief efforts because they felt we had not intervened quickly enough. They
                    forget that there had never been such a mass outpouring and return within such a
                    short period in the history of the world; it was truly a whole new episode in
                    humanitarian work.</p>
                <p>Haiti was a continuing problem. Refugees were leaving the island in droves to try
                    to get to Florida. Those who managed to land began to complain bitterly and
                    loudly that they were being treated differently from others arriving on U.S.
                    shores to claim political asylum. No doubt about it, the legislation was
                    discriminatory and favored Cubans, but many Floridians were dead set against
                    opening the doors for Haitians and therefore no change in the law was demanded.
                    Most Haitians were intercepted at sea and sent back to Haiti to be processed as
                    refugees. That is “in-country refugee processing” - a very unusual process that
                    we have done in a few countries only, like Vietnam and the Soviet Union (for
                    those who qualified under the Lautenberg amendment), for political reasons.
                    Intelligence kept saying that the determinant causing people to flee was not the
                    amount of repression in Haiti but the calculation on how strict the Coast Guard
                    was being and whether they could get in. For lots of political reasons, Randall
                    Robinson of Transafrica, who had been very involved in African issues and
                    particularly South Africa, took up the Haitian cause and finally prevailed on
                    President Clinton to order refugee processing for Haitians on boats, and not to
                    send them back to Haiti for processing. We were dumbstruck; refugee processing
                    just wasn't feasible aboard those rickety rafts that passed as “boats.”
                    Furthermore, when knowledge of this new process became known, we knew we would
                    be overwhelmed. We would also be confronted by other major issues such as what
                    would happen to sick people - would we bring them to the U.S. where they were
                    not welcome or take them back to Haiti, which was not really acceptable? Third
                    countries were not interested either. We tried to raise these problems at the
                    early meetings held to discuss Robinson's proposals. I remember Sandy Berger
                    sitting in the White House Situation Room saying that the President had decided
                    period and that was what we were going to do - no use arguing about it - just do
                    it! So PRM saluted and organized a process that involved renting cruise and
                    other ships. We got permission from the Jamaican government to anchor off
                    Montego Bay or Kingston Harbor so the ships could be supplied. As we had
                    predicted, as soon as the Haitians heard about this new process, they fled Haiti
                    in larger droves and the processing ships were soon overwhelmed.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Cubans saw what was happening and said that if the Haitians were going to be
                    processed at sea, they should have similar access to the processing ships
                    (easier than getting to Florida!). The ships were soon so overrun that more
                    could not be handled - Cubans also came from their island in droves. We then
                    faced the incredible challenge of where else we could take them to be processed.
                    We finally rented an old air force base in Panama and also used Guantanamo.
                    Those facilities in turn also became overwhelmed; there were growing questions
                    of how many from State and INS were available to do the screening, who would
                    take care of the health problems, and what to do with the sick and insane.
                    Finally the administration had to reverse course - it had to go back to
                    in-country processing in Haiti, and further negotiations with Cuba on numbers
                    allowed to leave.</p>
                <p>It is an incredible chapter from the Clinton administration, never talked about.
                    In dealing with large numbers of human beings, there are always some who are
                    sick, HIV positive, or mentally unstable. You don't want to admit these people
                    to the U.S., to become public charges, but how can any of them be returned
                    without providing some assistance? Processing of these major emigration flows
                    was a nightmare. Finally there was U.S. intervention in Haiti and a UN/OAS
                    process to restore President Aristide. The goals were much less ambitious than
                    they had been in Somalia and these limited goals were achieved. It is true that
                    Haiti is no further along today in its development than it was ten or fifteen
                    years ago, but the refugee crisis has passed, and a democratically elected ruler
                    was returned to power. We all know that the U.S. has tried to intervene in Haiti
                    throughout the 20th Century. My mother told me that while she was in college in
                    the 1920s, she joined a movement at the University of Nebraska against U.S.
                    military intervention in Haiti. (They protested by wearing their slickers open!)
                    Problems there continue. No one in the Clinton administration ever talks about
                    Haiti; it was buried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you encounter any problems with the regional bureaus
                        on turf issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: It depended on the region. I must say that PRM had no problems along
                    those lines with Dick Holbrooke, who is an old friend, concerning the Balkans.
                    There were no issues of that kind with him or his bureau. The more we could do
                    to help in his area, the better he liked it. This was at a time when he was
                    preparing for and leading the Dayton negotiations. He was anxious that I go out
                    to the Balkans and observe the situation at Tuzla after the Serb massacres with
                    my own eyes. So he gave us a lot of support.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I felt that when Rwanda really began to fall apart with the flood of refugees
                    into Tanzania and Zaire that we were well organized in the State Department to
                    meet that challenge. That was true for Department and the U.S. government as a
                    whole, and for the international and/or UN community to some extent. AID,
                    through its food program, was involved in the Rwanda problem. PRM was going to
                    take care of big contributions to UNHCR and the ICRC; African Affairs [AF] was
                    naturally involved politically as was the Human Rights Bureau. But in the
                    Department itself, there was no one person or office that was managing the total
                    issue. Brian Atwood, the director of AID, was designated as the U.S.
                    government's lead person, but he did not give constant attention to the problem.
                    He would chair a meeting periodically and then leave the issue - there was a
                    feeling that he didn't devote enough attention to Rwanda. Finally Doug Stafford
                    of AID and I agreed that more frequent meetings were necessary so that the
                    various programs could be coordinated. At last, in part because of my continuing
                    protests, Tim Wirth was appointed as the lead person on Rwanda. There had to be
                    some senior Department official who would coordinate all the various U.S.
                    government activities. Furthermore, the NSC had to appoint an individual who
                    could speak for the President and the White House. I was glad to see in the last
                    years of the Clinton administration “PD”(presidential decision) 56 issued, that
                    was an attempt to organize the bureaucracy for humanitarian emergencies so that
                    all parts would know what their responsibilities were, how they fit together,
                    and how the coordinating process was to work. There just had to be a
                    coordinating mechanism in the U.S. government for humanitarian crises such as
                    Rwanda.</p>
                <p>I think the international community has improved the management of its efforts as
                    well. The UN created a new Office for Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, that is
                    supposed to coordinate the efforts of all the specialized agencies - WFP, UNFPA,
                    UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, UNHCR - that was also badly needed. The new system has not
                    yet really been tested by another situation like Rwanda, except perhaps for
                    Kosovo. I think in that case, the new system worked reasonably well, although it
                    may not have been a good test because the Kosovo emergency was over relatively
                    quickly. I was not involved then so my observations are second and third
                    hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you the assistant secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I worked as PRM Assistant Secretary for three years. I joined the bureau
                    as principal deputy toward the end of the summer of 1993; I was sworn in as
                    assistant secretary in fall 1994 and stayed there until fall 1997.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>In early 1997, there was a change of Secretary of State and that obviously
                    changed lots of people and the way the Department operated. I had loved the
                    challenge of being the PRM Assistant Secretary; I had had ideas of what might be
                    done for women's health in refugee camps, for promoting certain projects, for
                    coordinating migration issues and working closely with Doris Meisner, the head
                    of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, etc., but Foreign Service
                    officers do not tend to stay in jobs for any extended period. By 1977, I felt
                    that I had dealt with population and humanitarian affairs long enough; I thought
                    it was time for someone new to take over to bring a fresh look at the issues I
                    had been wrestling with. I didn't want to go on doing the same thing
                    forever.</p>
                <p>I had found many parts of the NGO community to be wonderful and admirable, but I
                    found the continuous criticism and pressure from that sector, about what we were
                    not doing - never enough - quite irritating. There are a few organizations that
                    were established simply as refugee advocates who did nothing but criticize us. I
                    thought we were doing the right and appropriate thing, but that was never
                    mentioned! I had also found it very difficult to end refugee programs. It was
                    relatively easy to start one - there is usually a huge outpouring of sympathy
                    and resources are provided for assistance efforts. But I felt that in 1996 and
                    1997, it was time to end the Vietnamese “boat people” refugee program, or
                    Comprehensive Plan of Action [CPA]. The original agreement had been fulfilled. I
                    believe that the world organizes itself promptly to respond to refugee and
                    humanitarian situations, but it does not seem to be able to end those programs.
                    It prefers to keep people “on the dole” forever even if there are just not
                    enough resources to meet new emergencies if old ones are not closed down. We ran
                    into problems with returning to Vietnam those refugees who had not been accepted
                    for resettlement, particularly in the Hong Kong camps. There were riots. The
                    NGOs took to the streets and the Hong Kong government refused to continue to
                    support these so-called refugees. Most of the people left in the camps came
                    originally from North Vietnam and had fled for economic, not political, reasons.
                    We had set up by this time an orderly departure program (Orderly Departure
                    Program [ODP]) in Vietnam so those with real claims for resettlement did not
                    have to flee in boats.. It was time to close the CPA. But it was a real struggle
                    with some of the NGOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told that there were some people in Thailand
                        who were not really refugees, but they were being supported by NGOs and had
                        no incentive to return home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: NGO staffs are not very well paid, and their status, in my view, comes
                    from what they are able to force governments to do - how strongly they can push
                    and how much influence they have. It takes a different personality than mine to
                    deal with that mindset over a long period of time. I felt that the bureau had
                    done terrific work in the bureau for refugees. The staff was great; it had more
                    women than men by the way. We even had some meetings where there were only one
                    or two men. It was wonderful for me to be able to demonstrate in the Department
                    what we, a largely feminine staff, were able to achieve.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my years in G heading PRM. It was a wonderful experience
                    being in charge, but, as I said earlier, at the end of three years as assistant
                    secretary, I felt it was time to move on. My husband had retired by this time; I
                    was in my early 60s and I was not going to ask for anything from the new
                    Albright team in the Department. I thought there possibly might be some openings
                    for me in Washington; I certainly did not want to go overseas. We had moved so
                    often and we had finally settled in completely in Washington. We had
                    grandchildren close by and led a very busy life. My husband had often said that
                    he would be glad to accompany me overseas, stay home and do the wifely chores; I
                    always told him that that didn't pass the “giggle test.” It simply would not
                    have worked. In any case, Bob and I had been separated a lot because of our
                    Foreign Service responsibilities - Somalia, Vietnam, part of the Pakistan tour,
                    and then Somalia again. We just didn't want to be separated again.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of State was kind enough to offer me an ambassadorship, but that
                    was something I simply did not want to do. I had been an assistant secretary, a
                    title I felt had the same status, so I thought that if a suitable assignment in
                    Washington was not available, I would retire and that would have been fine.
                    Finally, when the INR assistant secretary left, Secretary Madeleine Albright
                    asked me if I would take that job and I said yes right away. I thought that
                    would be suitable and interesting - I had worked there before, and although not
                    my favorite job, being Assistant Secretary would be different. I knew what INR
                    was supposed to do, and I thought it would be a good way to end my career. So I
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>This offer was made about February or March 1997. I was amazed how long this
                    second confirmation process took. I think the whole confirmation process has
                    become so intrusive, takes so long, and involves such detailed financial and
                    character checks that it really has gotten out of hand. The Washington Post in
                    its In the Loop column now carries a graph which shows how many nominations have
                    been made and how many confirmed. In the last one, there were 435 nominations
                    that had been put into play and only 100 had been approved. It is so laborious
                    and has so many requirements that it now takes almost a year to get anyone
                    confirmed. That is simply not efficient.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>I turned in all the required paperwork. Everything was fine, except in the end,
                    there was a glitch. That came about because I had tried to help the son of a
                    Lebanese friend who had been at an American university - either Princeton or
                    Georgetown - get into graduate school at Columbia. He had been accepted.
                    However, his father during the Lebanese civil war had obtained Brazilian
                    passports for the entire family, even though they were Lebanese. So it was
                    difficult for the son to get his passport and student visa renewed. He was doing
                    this in London during a period when it took a long time to get an appointment at
                    the American embassy. He had an interview that did not go well (his first name
                    is Yassir, a big mistake); in fact he was told he would be an old man before he
                    could get another visa! So he was stuck in London and about to lose his place at
                    Columbia. It was a complicated situation and I didn't know what to do; I had
                    never served as a consular officer. So I called the consul general who I knew
                    and told him the problem as I understood it and I told him I didn't know what to
                    do. I asked whether there might be an opportunity for another interview with a
                    different consular officer. I asked him to look at it; I did not ask him to do
                    anything out of the ordinary. I did not want to contact the consular officer
                    directly as that, I thought, would be inappropriate. I had the impression that
                    the consul general would see this fellow but he did not, and the original
                    consular officer saw him again. And again it was not a good interview and I
                    thought it was over and done with, and there was nothing left to do. Then the
                    consul general called me back and said that he thought that there was something
                    I could do. He suggested that I write to INS and ask them to admit this young
                    man over the objections of our consular officer in London. Apparently, this was
                    a process used all the time because there had been so many problems with the
                    London consular section. So I followed the consul general's suggestion and
                    wrote; the first consular officer heard about it and blew her stack and filed
                    some petition with the Department's Inspector General about undue influence.</p>
                <p>Encounters with the Department's Inspector General's office is a whole other
                    issue. There were numerous complaints in the Department about how that office
                    worked, often secretly so that the accused has no opportunity to present another
                    side of the story. In any case, inspectors went to London to pursue the
                    complaint, trying to find out what had gone on. I did not have a clue that any
                    of this was happening. Finally, when I was told what was going on, I said that
                    if they had just come to me I could have shown them the complete file with all
                    the e-mails and exchanges. I was not a bureaucrat for nothing - on something
                    like this I kept all the documentation! As I said, I had never heard of the
                    procedure of an appeal to INS, but since it had been suggested by the consul
                    general, I assumed that it was perfectly legitimate. Finally, someone from INS
                    came to see me and I showed him the file. He immediately said that I had done
                    nothing wrong; there was no shred of impropriety whatsoever. But this
                    investigation held up my confirmation - it was very disagreeable and left a very
                    bad taste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a former consul general, it sounds like the procedure
                        that was suggested to you was devised to get around some consular officers
                        who may have been temperamentally not suited for the job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Apparently the embassy in London had a huge consular problem. I didn't
                    try to do anything underhanded - the INS appeal procedure had been suggested to
                    me by the consul general. The State inspectors even had gone to INS to look at
                    the letterhead I had used in my correspondence, to see whether I had used
                    official State Department letterhead. In fact, I had written the letter on my
                    computer and my secretary wasn't even involved. I printed it out, but I couldn't
                    remember what stationery I used. It turned out that I used even a private
                    envelope. So the longer the inspectors reviewed the case, the less question
                    there was. It did wonder how the U.S. government had sunk to this low level of
                    trust.</p>
                <p>Finally, after several months, I was completely cleared. The “gotcha' [got you]”
                    attitude of the Inspector's Office really irritated me and left a horrible
                    residue of distaste. The system was not open. There was little or no explanation
                    of what the perceived problem was, and there was not much opportunity to present
                    my point of view. I felt many of the inspectors were trying to trap me, probing
                    into my relationship with Yassir's family and asking about gifts! The whole
                    process was so disgusting and so seemingly un-American that I was really
                    furious.</p>
                <p>I had another problem in my confirmation process but on a lighter note. Bob and I
                    were on vacation at our beach house in Duck, North Carolina when I got a call
                    from the White House. A young girl by the name of Ashley - just by the name, one
                    knew she must have been under twenty-five - was on the other end of the
                    telephone with a few more questions. Did I pay Social Security for our yardman?
                    I kept explaining that we hired a lawn service; that was a contractual
                    relationship that required the employer to pay all taxes. Then she asked me
                    whether I had paid Social Security taxes for the servants we employed overseas.
                    I tried to explain to her that as an Ambassador's wife I had lived in embassy
                    residences for which we paid an embassy set fee as part of official residence
                    expenses [ORE]. I continued that under State regulations, it was the
                    responsibility of the embassy to manage personnel matters for the staff of the
                    residence, such as leave, taxes, and pensions. She hadn't a clue what I was
                    talking about and couldn't understand the ORE concept. I finally just told her
                    that all taxes had been paid! I also told her that I had always paid Social
                    Security taxes on my Washington help. But the interrogation went on and on; it
                    took over an hour. The last question was whether I had done anything that would
                    embarrass the Clintons! My mouth fell open. I thought, “What Chutzpah!” How
                    could anyone and especially a young girl like Ashley ask a question involving
                    embarrassing the Clintons! It should have been the other way around! I have
                    always wished that question could have been used in some TV show or Washington
                    publication, with a prize for the “best” answer. It was just unbelievable to me,
                    but the question was asked - and firmly answered in the negative!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been a time when you were ready to tell
                        the powers-to-be to “jump in the lake.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Yes, indeed. I didn't think the whole process of moving to INR had
                    started very well. The formal confirmation hearings in the Senate went very
                    well; but in the fall the committee and the Senate were about to recess before
                    the final vote. So I didn't know what was going to happen or when. Julia Taft,
                    who was designated to succeed me as PRM assistant secretary, was going through
                    the same thing, so I still had my PRM office to sit in. When you are waiting to
                    start a new job, and the wait goes on and on - for six months in my case - you
                    are not inclined to take any new initiatives, and I felt we were all treading
                    water. I didn't think it was proper for me to travel for PRM, although I went to
                    Geneva again for the big UNHCR October meeting.</p>
                <p>Finally, on a Monday morning, the Senate voted. In the afternoon someone walked
                    in and swore me as the new INR assistant secretary. That is how I started. I
                    didn't want to have another large swearing-in ceremony; I had done that once for
                    RPM and that was enough. Furthermore, the intelligence community is much smaller
                    and tighter - it is not quite the same thing as dealing with a large number of
                    public NGOs and other outside groups. So at the age of 63, I started my last two
                    years in the Foreign Service as the assistant secretary for the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research (INR).</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I have very mixed feelings about that tour. It was the only time
                    in my career when I returned to a bureau or area where I had worked previously.
                    It is true that as assistant secretary I had access to much more information -
                    much of it very sensitive - than I had had as a deputy assistant secretary. Also
                    new were the management requirements of an assistant secretary as well as
                    liaison responsibilities with CIA and other parts of the intelligence community.
                    I was also the person responsible for seeing that the seventh floor principals
                    were informed on all matters that I thought they should know about.</p>
                <p>But I must admit, the job didn't have the old kick. There was something missing
                    from the normal rush when you go to a new job. I think I learned, rather late in
                    life, that for me returning to a bureau or country where I had served previously
                    just wasn't as much fun.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the resource situation had gotten very bad. Often INR positions were
                    very hard to fill and there was now a general shortage of FSOs. We were begging
                    and borrowing from other agencies for people who could work in INR. So there
                    wasn't enough money or enough people - not just for INR, but the Department as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I had a very good group of deputies. I had held over one political
                    appointee from the previous assistant secretary but, unfortunately, that didn't
                    work out well and it was not a good fit. I brought in a new person with
                    Congressional experience as the “political” deputy and he was just terrific. Ed
                    Abington was the principal deputy. He had moved into his job before I arrived
                    and as I had know him for my whole Foreign Service career we worked well and
                    easily together.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>We are now in the middle of November 1997. Madeleine Albright had started as
                    Secretary of State in January. Ten months later her patterns had been set; for
                    intelligence they had been established when she was at the UN with a CIA
                    briefer. This continued at State, the CIA briefer bringing her the PDB
                    (President's Daily Brief) that only she and the Deputy Secretary saw, as well as
                    other CIA briefing material. I was not permitted to see the PDB, nor did I know
                    what else the CIA brought to her. I did not know if she read the chief INR
                    product, the Secretary's Morning Summary (SMS).</p>
                <p>I never felt that Secretary Albright used INR well. I never had the feeling that
                    she and I were on the same wavelength and that was a real problem. I asked her
                    many times whether INR was doing what she wanted and whether we were meeting her
                    needs. She said that she was quite satisfied but nothing more, and there were no
                    requests.</p>
                <p>Then we had a security event. It was the only one that happened on my watch but
                    it was serious and got a lot of publicity. We called it the “brown tweed coat”
                    incident. Someone had walked into the secretary's outer office and picked up one
                    of the INR briefcases that had been left by an INR staff member for the
                    Secretary in the Executive Secretariat. That was the way the system worked -
                    State's INR briefer would leave INR material for the Secretary's use during the
                    day when she could get to it, and returned to pick up the briefcase at the end
                    of the day. The secretaries working in the Secretariat that day did not know the
                    person who walked in but did not challenge him. There had never been a problem
                    and they did not think it their job to question the pick-up. So the briefcase
                    with its highly classified material disappeared and could not be found. We did
                    have a record of the material in the briefcase, according to our security
                    practices. I suspected that someone picked it up innocently to return to INR and
                    when he found out what was in it, was embarrassed and didn't want to confess his
                    misdeed. None of the documents reappeared; none of the information included in
                    the material appeared in the press; there were no leaks and no indication ever
                    what might have happened to the briefcase and its contents. But no one knew and
                    it was a very unsettling episode. The secretary received a lot of criticism,
                    suggesting that she was not serious about security, which she did not like. No
                    one could identify the person who had taken the briefcase. Procedures were
                    changed, which emphasized even better control of classified information, and a
                    guard was placed at the entrance to the Executive Secretariat, but all of this
                    was after the horse left the barn.</p>
                <p>Afterward we worked hard on our security procedures and spent a lot of time
                    considering our potential vulnerabilities. But we never found out who the
                    mysterious intruder was nor do we know what happened to the material. The whole
                    episode is still a complete mystery as far as I know.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: We had a range of “customers” throughout the building. Strobe Talbott,
                    the Deputy Secretary, did not appear that interested in INR as INR. He also had
                    a CIA briefer, who kept him up to date on Russian affairs that were his main
                    interest. I don't think he used intelligence information in the way Tom
                    Pickering, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, did. Tom was a vacuum
                    cleaner. He could never get enough information and we supplied him continuously.
                    He knew the system; he knew how to ask for information. He could do this because
                    he had worked in the Department for many years and was used to the intelligence
                    system.</p>
                <p>Further, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs was the Department's principal
                    contact with George Tenet, the CIA director, on certain issues. Relations with
                    the geographic bureaus, and such functional bureaus as PM, were always very
                    close. Often our analysts and desk officers would work hand in glove - I know I
                    did when I was the Afghan desk officer.</p>
                <p>Secretary Albright liked Tenet; she and he used to have lunch together
                    periodically. As assistant secretary for INR, I always looked for debriefings
                    after meetings and lunches the secretary had with the CIA director, but that was
                    rarely done. She just didn't send information down the line and seemed to be
                    unaware of institutional needs and how such debriefings might benefit her in the
                    long run. The Executive Secretary would try to find out at least what issues had
                    been discussed and whether any follow-up was required but that was not very
                    successful either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that there would be some danger in top CIA
                        officials discussing matters with top State officials without the filtering
                        prism that INR might provide. There is no opportunity for putting the
                        information in a broader context.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I agree. I think Madeleine Albright, having been our representative at
                    the UN for four years - long before I took the INR job - thought she knew the
                    context of everything and therefore did not need INR's assistance. So I never
                    established the kind of relationship that I had hoped for and believed
                    necessary. I was not very happy with that state of affairs because I did not
                    think that I was fulfilling a role that the secretary needed. I don' t believe
                    she ever learned how to ask INR for information or analysis nor did she feel she
                    needed it. Later on, she said INR should no longer send her anything on Kosovo
                    as she knew everything she needed! My attempts to discuss intelligence issues in
                    general with her were never scheduled, or kept when scheduled.</p>
                <p>Q: Some Foreign Service officers have complained that they felt cut off from the
                    secretary because she had surrounded herself with a “palace guard,” similar to
                    what Baker had, although not nearly of as high a caliber as those who surrounded
                    Baker.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely. There was a small group of people surrounding her - Barbara
                    Larkin, the assistant secretary for congressional relations, Elaine Shocas, her
                    chief-of-staff; Bonnie Cohen, the Under Secretary for Management (with no
                    experience in the Department); Wendy Sherman, the counselor; Jamie Rubin, the
                    spokesperson, and some staff aids. It was a tight little group around the
                    secretary, difficult to penetrate. Once I had to take her a sensitive paper when
                    the group had gathered in her inner office late in the day, and I felt like an
                    absolute intruder - like a freshman barging in on a group of seniors having a
                    hen party, is the best way I can describe it. I think this group “protecting”
                    her from the bureaucrats only got tighter as her tenure progressed.</p>
                <p>The secretary cared very much about Sandy Berger, the national security advisor,
                    not getting intelligence information before she did. He would call her and ask
                    her if she had seen such and such a message and ask what did she intended to do
                    about it. She would be very, very unhappy if she had not seen that message. It
                    was wacky, because the NSC got “intel” flashes before we did, but she was really
                    bothered by Berger having information before she did. Once there had been a
                    report about some military action in Iraq with repercussions in Iran and Sandy
                    Berger called Albright and screamed and yelled. So she called me to find out
                    what was going on, also screaming and yelling. INR had not yet got the report,
                    but we called immediately and began to move into action with NEA to see what
                    should be done. In fact, NSA recalled the message later in the day as not being
                    accurate - and after all the fuss we stood down, without ever a word from the
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think many applauded Albright's appointment, but she did
                        not shine and left with a whimper. That was too bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Everybody had such high hopes for Albright, myself included. But she was
                    not a good manager. Being a professor does not give management experience,
                    unless you have to run a department or school, and she had someone to do it for
                    her at USUN. Of course, there were lots of complaints about how the Clinton
                    administration in general was managed. There was no clear delineation of
                    responsibilities. She was clearly not in charge of our entire foreign policy -
                    Berger was the China policy maker, Madeleine Albright handled the Balkans,
                    Talbott ran our Russian policy, and Dennis Ross did the Middle East with Martin
                    Indyk. It was a confused, diffuse structure.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>INR, I believe, had excellent relations throughout the Department and within the
                    intelligence community. I enjoyed the intellectual stimulation of coordination
                    meetings at the agency, and always felt that INR was able to make a major,
                    substantive contribution. We were always anxious for feedback, and enjoyed give
                    and take over an issue, and pursuing a problem. I asked repeatedly that we be
                    given feedback on the analyses that we were sending the Secretary. She would
                    agree, but then nothing happened. There was just no response; we never knew what
                    she liked or did not like. Occasionally, she would note her approval of a
                    memorandum. But she never answered the question of what INR might do better for
                    her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people have described the situation as the professor
                        and her graduate assistants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I think that is apt. That is the way she had operated much of her life
                    and she just replicated it in the Department. People have said that Warren
                    Christopher ran the Department as a law firm. That was what he was accustomed to
                    and presumably comfortable with. George Shultz, on the other hand, had had
                    considerable management experience and he had been a cabinet secretary (Labor
                    and Treasury and OMB director); he also had taught labor relations and had
                    worked as a CEO in a corporation. So he had vast management experience and it
                    made quite a difference.</p>
                <p>Q: People I have interviewed give Shultz great marks as the best rounded, most
                    appreciated Secretary of State. Baker had great strengths; he handled the
                    extremely difficult process of the breaking up of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>OAKLEY: And unification of Germany, the Gulf War, and the Madrid Conference. I
                    don't think he wanted to get involved in the Balkans at all in 1991 as the
                    presidential campaign was getting under way and that may have been a big
                    mistake. Against his personal wishes, I believe, he resigned as Secretary of
                    State and took over Bush's struggling campaign, trying to focus on domestic
                    issues more than the international ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also strangely absent at the beginning of the Gulf
                        War. He came a little late.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I wasn't in the Department at that time so I really cannot comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a superb negotiator assisted by an extremely
                        competent team. Madeleine Albright did not have that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: That's right, his skill coming possibly from his experience as a lawyer
                    and as President Reagan's Chief of Staff. I don't believe Albright knew how to
                    use the competent professionals she had in the bureaus. Kissinger was probably
                    the best at this, assembling his crack team all from within the Department.
                    There was no effort on her part to reach down into the bureaucracy and establish
                    links. Her coterie was very critical of career officers. It is one of the major
                    reasons why her relationship with the Foreign Service deteriorated and morale
                    fell.</p>
                <p>I asked Secretary Albright to pay INR a visit. As a Deputy, I had asked Larry
                    Eagleburger when he was Secretary and he came to talk to new analysts, who were
                    thrilled. But she never did. I had another problem as I wanted to bring the real
                    experts with me for briefings. Now I have always considered myself a “quick
                    study” but I felt it was better to have the real experts on hand if questions
                    arose I could not handle, rather than having to get back later with the
                    information. After a few dubious looks at new briefers, it was clear she wanted
                    the assistant secretary only to do the briefings. It did not bother me to have
                    one of my staff give a briefing. My job was not to know everything; my job was
                    to get the information to those who needed it.</p>
                <p>I noted that when President Bush came to the Department right after his
                    inauguration to be briefed before his trip to Mexico, Powell asked four desk
                    officers to do the briefing. That was the right thing to do for the detailed
                    issues involved but novel for the Department after Albright.</p>
                <p>I was used to State Department meetings when the secretary would turn to the INR
                    representative and ask whether there was any new information or comment from
                    intelligence. I went to lots of meetings with Albright on major issues, often in
                    regard to Bosnia; she would turn to the regional assistant secretary to start
                    the discussion but never called on anyone else. I would carefully listen and if
                    I felt something really wrong or if there were other points of view that should
                    be aired, I would raise my hand to enter the conversation but it was hard to be
                    recognized. It was an odd process to me. We hardly ever used the Secretary's
                    conference room; rather Albright would hold her meetings in her back office that
                    was more like a crowded living room. There was no request for attendees to
                    express their opinions; so she usually heard from one speaker and often that was
                    it. The meetings were not well run.</p>
                <p>I should mention that the Secretary held a grudge against, Ed Abington, the
                    Principal Deputy, for remarks he made when he left Jerusalem where he had served
                    as Consul General. She could not forget that. In the spring of 1998 I began to
                    get hints from Elaine Shocas that perhaps it would be wise to change deputies. I
                    asked for reasons; I said I would be willing to change if there was a good
                    reason but I never got one. I think the Secretary was reminded of the incident
                    if she saw Ed, and would raise it with Elaine Shocas. It infuriated me to see
                    that kind of approach to personnel. I tried to get an appointment with Elaine so
                    that we could have an extended conversation about the problem, but she would not
                    even call me back. It was staggering!</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>In the summer of 1998, I was asked to chair the panel considering promotions
                    oFSO-1s to OC (or into the senior Foreign Service). That was an eight week task;
                    one of the most important promotion panels in the system. Uneasy about leaving
                    Ed in the Secretary's line of sight, I asked Tom Pickering whether I should go
                    off to chair this panel. Tom told me that for the sake of the Foreign Service I
                    had to go on the panel. So I did that. Toward the end of the eight weeks, our
                    embassies in Dar Salaam and Nairobi were bombed. Those events raised lots of
                    questions about intelligence and then we bombed the pharmaceutical plant in the
                    Sudan as well as training camps in Afghanistan. This, as you will remember,
                    elicited a long article in The New York Times by Jim Risen, raising more
                    questions about intelligence.</p>
                <p>I came back to INR right away and it was an uncomfortable situation. Tom
                    Pickering told me the Secretary did not like the analyses that had been coming
                    from INR. I asked Tom what to do about the problem and whether I should go see
                    the secretary to talk about her unhappiness. He said, “No; talk to me.” I asked
                    him whether he had a specific example of an analysis that fell short so that we
                    could learn from it. Then Tom asked me whether I didn't want to change deputies.
                    This all happened toward the end of the summer 1998.</p>
                <p>During the fall, I think in an effort to improve her intelligence briefings, I
                    was finally invited to be a part of the early morning CIA briefing. In fact, as
                    I mentioned, it had not really been a briefing, but rather the delivery by a
                    mid-level CIA official of the President's Daily Briefing (PDB) paper as well as
                    other CIA reports which the secretary read. As I also mentioned, I didn't know
                    what was in those documents; I went over our material before going to this daily
                    meeting, but that was not the same as knowing what the secretary was reading. It
                    was hard to discuss what our analysis was as compared to CIA's and what should
                    be done about any differences. I was supposed to have a few minutes alone with
                    the secretary every day just before the CIA briefer showed up, but the secretary
                    decided that she would see us together. So I would just sit there while the
                    secretary read the CIA material. Sometime, I did not agree with the comments
                    made by the CIA briefer and tried to offer comments, but was told not to
                    interrupt. The whole process was totally unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>The secretary had not had overseas government experience and therefore I did not
                    feel she had a good feel for the adequacy of CIA sources. We who have worked
                    overseas have learned to look at some sources with considerable skepticism. But
                    the secretary seemed to accept CIA information unconditionally; she loved
                    anything that was clandestine or which was reported by national technical means.
                    She didn't really read a lot of other material as far as I could tell. She liked
                    the “inside hot stuff:” but I thought it skewed her view of events.</p>
                <p>I had heard a funny story on this issue. People who worked for the Secretary
                    right after she went to the UN said that if you wanted her to know something,
                    you had to make sure that someone else reported it. When it was picked up by
                    intercepts she would read it!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is too bad because when she was first appointed many of
                        us were cheering for her and looking forward to a different secretaryship.
                        Christopher must have been a cold, distant lawyer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Frankly, I found the sessions with her very uncomfortable and I was
                    relieved when she decided that she didn't want me to attend the daily CIA
                    briefings. I think if she had kept 5-10 minutes at the beginning of the day for
                    INR's intelligence, it would have been much more effective and provided some
                    context. I felt she was never comfortable with me and clearly did not seek my
                    views. At the same time I was working easily with everyone else at State and the
                    larger IC (Intelligence Community) - they all seemed to esteem our work, with
                    good give-and-take. People in CIA, the Pentagon, and the NSC all told me
                    consistently that our analysis was the best in government. We had the advantage
                    of all-source intelligence and very good analysts and editors, and we all took
                    great pride in that.</p>
                <p>The situation did not improve over time. There were more hints about Abington to
                    the effect that I should get rid of him. I will admit that I grew angrier and
                    angrier over this and dug in my heels - I was determined that unless some
                    justifiable cause were presented to me which I could discuss with him, I was not
                    about to try to push Ed out. I thought it was a despicable way to handle a
                    personnel issue, one involving a respected senior officer whose only offense had
                    been to say something that could be seen as criticizing the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Ed aware of his situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: I assumed he was aware of all of it. He and I had a close working
                    relationship, although we did not discuss this effort to remove him from INR.
                    Perhaps I should have. Everyone else in the bureau's front office was aware of
                    Ed's situation. After I retired, when Don Keyser, who was Abington's successor,
                    was dismissed because of a security incident and the new assistant secretary,
                    Stapleton Roy, because of it resigned and retired, everyone in the bureau kept
                    telling me that history repeated itself!</p>
                <p>In early 1999 I came to the conclusion that I did not want to stay in the job.
                    The whole atmosphere was just too uncomfortable. I was approaching my 65th
                    birthday, which meant that unless I retired soon, I probably could not start a
                    part-time career, such as teaching. In any case, I was increasingly put off by
                    the way Albright was running the Department. The Secretary obviously was not
                    happy with me as the head of INR. That was clear when Mort Halperin, who had
                    been brought in to head the Policy Planning Staff and who was, I believe an old
                    friend of Albright's, came to see me and told me that he had been asked to
                    remake INR. I found that disconcerting but was curious to know what needed
                    changing. What did she want? I told him that I would cooperate fully and help
                    him in any way I could. It turned out that the first thing he wanted to do was
                    change the bureau's name, and he had several suggestions. I was amazed - we
                    could easily have done it, even if it was a nuisance, but that was hardly a
                    major remaking of rethinking of INR's work and mission. What a way to run a
                    railroad!</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Mort and I did have other discussions about INR from time to time; I would throw
                    out some ideas and he always said he would get back to me; but he never did. It
                    was a ludicrous effort. It also turned out that the secretary wanted longer
                    reports, which we were certainly more than happy to do. It was the opposite of
                    what we had always assumed: i.e. that busy people on the seventh floor did not
                    have time for lengthy analyses. So we started doing that; it was the kind of
                    guidance that I had been seeking for a long time - and it was helpful.</p>
                <p>Things began to fall into place. Tom Pickering told me the Secretary wanted to
                    bring Stapleton Roy, Ambassador to Indonesia, to INR and I told him this was the
                    perfect time for me to retire from the Foreign Service. I have never had to
                    speak to Madeleine Albright since.</p>
                <p>Abington was told to leave in June 1999 - he was given a cubby hole down the hall
                    while he figured out what to do next. He felt that he could not get another
                    assignment while Albright was secretary. Tom Pickering, of course, worried what
                    could be done to keep Ed; he thought quite highly of him. I had to wonder why he
                    hadn't done more earlier on and had the feeling that Tom was rather powerless at
                    this stage of the game; the coterie had taken over all management of the
                    Department, even as it distanced itself from the bureaucracy. I felt very sorry
                    for Ed Abington because he was a very good officer and had done an outstanding
                    job in Jerusalem, fostering understanding with Palestinians, and working with
                    the Palestinian Authority to try to bring it around in the peace process. He
                    also had done a good job in Pakistan as political counselor and then DCM. His
                    departure was a real loss for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I liked Don Keyser, Ed's replacement, very much. He was a China expert; he had
                    served several tours there and he spoke Chinese. He had been the director of
                    Chinese affairs and had worked very closely with Stapleton Roy on a number of
                    assignments and he also had had some assignments outside East Asia. I think he
                    was pleased to come to INR and I found him very witty and savvy in his dealings
                    on all sorts of internal management issues. We got along famously and I could
                    not have been more delighted with that selection - and I thought he would be
                    very good for INR. After my departure I was really sorry when he became the
                    “scapegoat” of a security incident in which a laptop computer filled with
                    classified information was left unattended in a secure office and stolen. In the
                    end he was completely exonerated, but he lost a lot before that happened. Roy
                    resigned when Keyser was dismissed by Secretary Albright; he also had come to
                    feel he should look elsewhere for future employment. Here again, the process
                    with Albright was disagreeable.</p>
                <p>Looking back, there were two things that I found unforgivable during Madeleine
                    Albright's tenure. One was the collapse of the morale in the State Department. I
                    was shocked to hear what young officers were saying in the halls; one proclaimed
                    his loathing for Madeleine Albright. I had never heard comments like that in the
                    Foreign Service. We lost a lot of good officers during her tenure.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>The other was her failure to use INR properly. I think INR provided excellent
                    service - both in the dissemination of material and in analysis - and we
                    maintained very good, productive relationships with all the bureaus and others
                    on the seventh floor and throughout the intelligence community. I would not have
                    served in a higher position without my own intelligence office. I felt hurt for
                    INR and sorry that INR did not have the influence it might have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up unhappiness with Albright in other
                        parts of the intelligence community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: To some extent. Tom Pickering and I periodically went out to CIA to have
                    long discussions with George Tenet on a whole series of operational issues. On
                    one occasion, George opened the meeting by saying Mort Halperin had come out to
                    see him because he had been given the task of remaking INR. I said I thought it
                    was a crazy idea at that stage - the administration had been in power for six
                    years and it was hardly the time to reorganize, but I said I had told Mort I
                    would cooperate with him in any way possible. Further, I doubted Congress would
                    go along - there were other things for Congress, as well as the administration,
                    to spend its time on. George said he agreed. As I mentioned, I had known of the
                    Halperin assignment, but Tenet's comment raised my ire once again, because of
                    the way it was being done - out consulting others without really coming to
                    INR.</p>
                <p>In any case, by the time I was leaving, Roy was ready to succeed me. There was to
                    be a short overlap; I was planning to leave by the end of July, which I did in
                    order to take the retirement course. The timing worked out well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired in 1999.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: That's right. I had a wonderful retirement ceremony with Strobe Talbott
                    doing the honors. There were nice letters, certificates, and medals from all
                    parts of the intelligence community. CIA gave me its highest award. My five
                    grandchildren were at the ceremony - Josephine, at two, fell and split her lip
                    and had to be picked up and comforted by Strobe Talbott. Later, my oldest
                    grandson commented to one of his friends that I got so many medals! And that was
                    the way my twenty-five years in the Foreign Service ended.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Colin Powell's assumption of the role of the Secretary of State has been nothing
                    short of spectacular. He immediately knew how to say the right things. I think
                    the briefing that he held for the President's first trip to a foreign country,
                    to Mexico, was indicative of a new attitude. Bush came to the Department and
                    addressed Foreign Service officers. He said that he wanted to be briefed for his
                    trip to Mexico by the desk officers - I am sure that was at the urging of the
                    secretary. He said he wanted to hear from the people who really knew the
                    situation on the ground. So four young desk officers conducted the briefing. I
                    heard later that the president raised an issue that no one else in the room knew
                    anything about, except for one of the desk officers. The president and this
                    young officer had a conversation without interruption from any one else. When
                    word of this meeting got around, morale soared in the Department. Other young
                    officers were proud that some of their colleagues met with the president and
                    they all thought, I am sure, that it might happen to them. It gave them a sense
                    of importance that had been lacking for many years. It was terrific. The
                    President remarked that during the airplane incident with China, it was clear to
                    him that the Department and Colin Powell were taking the lead and that the issue
                    was being handled well and quietly through diplomacy. I thought that expressed
                    appreciation was a very welcome change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have the impression that Powell had been told that
                        the Department had suffered under some terrible management and that a rescue
                        mission was in order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: Absolutely. During the transition there were loads of panels, task
                    forces, working groups meeting all over town to generate ideas for the
                    Department's renaissance. The best one, I think, was chaired by Frank Carlucci,
                    who started his illustrious career as a Foreign Service officer. Working with
                    the Council on Foreign Relations and CSIS, he kept his panel very focused. The
                    report starts with some large sweeping generalizations, emphasizing that the
                    President has to designate the Secretary of State as his spokesperson on foreign
                    policy. That is what Bush did. Then the report recommended that the NSC assume
                    again its role as coordinator - which was its original raison d'�tre - rather
                    that the maker or implementor of foreign policy. It pointed out that the
                    secretary and his Department was responsible for making recommendations on
                    policy, for the president's decision. Furthermore, the secretary and his
                    Department were to be the principal implementor of policies approved by the
                    President.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I think that is a particularly important point, because when I was working on
                    refugee affairs, I would often see NSC staff members lusting to take over actual
                    operations. It was never the same thing twice, however, and therefore there was
                    no overall operational consistency. Such NSC action impeded coordination within
                    the Department because, instead of having a coordination meeting in the
                    Department beforehand, representatives of each involved office or bureau would
                    traipse over to the White House without having had an opportunity to talk to
                    each other first. I grew up in the age of Phil Habib who, when there was a
                    crisis, would convene a coordinating meeting and made sure that all parts of the
                    Department were working from the same script. If there was a subsequent meeting
                    at the NSC, all State officials knew what the Department's position was.</p>
                <p>The Carlucci report went on to say that it considered the Department to be
                    outdated and dysfunctional in many ways. In certain respects that situation was
                    caused by the lack of adequate resources. So the report urged the new secretary
                    to enter into a bargain with Congress, calling for reform of the Department in
                    exchange for additional resources. Everyone knows the personnel problems -
                    entry, pay, training, career paths - where there is a lot of work to be done.
                    State's technological information systems are completely outdated. We all hear
                    the stories of people joining the Department after having worked in private
                    business who are astounded by how outdated the Department's systems are. Then
                    there is the question of the insecurity and shabbiness of our institutions
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>I think Colin has launched efforts to address all of these weaknesses. Of course
                    there is no guarantee of success because Congress has to appropriate resources,
                    even to start some of the reforms. Someone close to the secretary recently told
                    me that Powell had commented that when he came to the Department that he had, of
                    course, heard that the management was in bad shape, but that he had had no idea
                    how bad it really was.</p>
                <p>I am delighted to see the changes he is making. I am having a wonderful time, I
                    must say, in retirement. I taught at Mount Holyoke last spring; I am teaching
                    one course at SAIS this fall. I am still involved with lots of boards and
                    studies, working with the U.S. Committee for the UN Population Fund. I am very
                    involved with Northwestern University. So I lead quite a wonderful life, fuller
                    than I had imagined, and I look back on my career with no regrets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, what comments do you have on things that
                        went well and things that did not go so well in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>OAKLEY: Bob and I have always said that we enjoyed every posting we ever had -
                    usually for different reasons. We loved the Sudan in 1958-60. It was our first
                    post and our honeymoon. The gentleness and kindness of the Sudanese are
                    unforgettable as well as the many friends we made there. We liked Abidjan; we
                    were able to use our French. It was hard with two little children, as medical
                    care then was not as it is now. But it was a wonderful experience - the
                    Francophone world. Then Bob went to Vietnam; that was not easy. I lived in
                    Shreveport, Bob's home, because my father had retired after a heart attack and
                    my parents had moved to California. Shreveport was where Bob had grown up and
                    his family knew everybody in town. Living there was as easy as it could be with
                    two small children and a husband far away. There was, of course, loneliness and
                    other problems without my husband. But I probably would never have gone back to
                    work without the opportunity Shreveport's Centenary College gave me to do some
                    teaching, even though I did not have a Ph.D. I hustled hard and worked at it and
                    enjoyed it, as I think my students did. It was nice to discover I still had a
                    brain that I could use.</p>
                <p>Then we went to Paris - heavenly for me, rather dull for Bob - and on to New
                    York, where I had a part-time job as a consultant in the NGO world - the
                    national board of the YWCA. That job was a great introduction to the non-profit
                    world and how it operated but New York was hard; we didn't have parents close by
                    for weekends. In those days there was no housing allowance and to take our
                    children out of the city we had to maximize family vacations, friends in the
                    country, and lots of weekend activity. My little bit of income came in very
                    handy.</p>
                <p>It was terrific when Bob was offered the job in Beirut as political counselor,
                    working foBill Buffum. I think for our family that was our easiest, nicest
                    assignment. We had a spacious apartment; servants were plentiful; the children
                    could walk to school along the Cornish overlooking the Mediterranean; Bob walked
                    to the embassy. I audited a Turkish history course at AUB and I got involved
                    with the American Women's Club. We traveled a lot; there was also skiing,
                    tennis, and a beach chalet. We had loads of Lebanese friends. They were warm,
                    hospitable, and lively and they are still our friends to this day.</p>
                <p>In 1974, Bob came back to work for the Policy Planning Staff and then went to the
                    NSC staff to replace Hal Saunders when Hal went to the Department to head NEA.
                    And finally went to work as a Foreign Service officer - sixteen years after
                    resigning to marry.</p>
                <p>I look back on most periods with certain regrets, because there were things I
                    might have done better or differently. For example, I wish I had studied more
                    Arabic in Khartoum. I had the time. It was not easy to do because there were no
                    courses and tutors were not well organized, but I could have made some progress.
                    I am sorry that I did not insist on a higher grade when I returned to the
                    Foreign Service in light of all the experience I had had. I have always been
                    somewhat amazed I came back in as the oldest living FSO-7.</p>

                <p>Someone recently asked me the question of what might have happened to my career
                    if I hadn't been forced to resign when I married, or if I hadn't married. Those
                    possibilities had really not occurred to me - and I gave a lot of thought to my
                    answers. I think I would have had a good career, but I don't think it would have
                    been as rich and rewarding, and varied, as it turned out to be. I know my life
                    certainly would have been different and probably harder. I like to think that I
                    helped Bob in his career and I know he helped me.</p>

                <p>OAKLEY: I don't regret those years that were devoted to Bob's career and our
                    children. Those 16 years I was out of the Foreign Service were not dull and
                    boring - we were moving from one continent to another every two years and it was
                    hard on our children. By the time I returned to the State Department, our
                    daughter was entering the National Cathedral School and our son went to junior
                    high school. Perhaps my re-entry was difficult in another way, as our family was
                    used to my doing everything. I think we really would have had problems moving
                    every two years if I hadn't been there at home all the time in the early
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There just isn't a totally satisfactory way to have both a
                        career and a family, particularly in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OAKLEY: You're right. I have given advice to women who have come to me with
                    questions about Foreign Service life - that going into the Foreign Service is a
                    career; it is not just a job and it is certainly not a 9:00 to 5:00 job.
                    Entertaining and enjoying meeting people socially is important, as well as
                    writing reports and staying late to get them out. All of these requirements are
                    important, even essential. The Foreign Service must be seen as a way of life,
                    not just a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>I look back with wonder about how my life evolved. I would never have thought, in
                    the summer of 1957, that I would be involved in all the issues I did deal with -
                    the Middle East, the PLO and the UN, the Panama Canal treaty and its debate in
                    the U.S., being a cultural affairs officer in Kinshasa, the Afghanistan desk,
                    and deputy spokesperson - then to go into the intelligence area and population
                    and humanitarian affairs and twice an Assistant Secretary. There is no central
                    theme; all of the assignments were so different. Many of the opportunities came
                    as a complete surprise; that is, people came to me to see whether I would be
                    interested in doing such and such. But I think it all worked out superbly, with
                    great good luck. To me, one of the greatest pleasures in the Foreign Service was
                    being challenged by a new activity or a new job, and the fact that you don't
                    stay in one job long enough to grow weary of it. You may not be an expert, but
                    you approach new challenges with a wide range of knowledge and experience. For
                    example, I had never known much about the intelligence community and process,
                    but I did know something about how its product is used and that was a great
                    help. In summary, I feel very, very lucky and satisfied with my Foreign Service
                    life experience.</p>
