                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Foreign Affairs Oral History Program interview
                        with Paul White. Today is May 30, 2006, and we are in the northern Virginia
                        suburbs of Washington, DC. This interview is being conducted under the
                        auspices of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Paul, let's begin at the beginning. Could you tell
                        me when and where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was born in August 1941 a small town in southwestern Indiana, Brazil,
                    Indiana. When all you have in the state are hogs and corn, you have to find
                    exotic names for towns to keep the people there. So, Brazil, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's go on on your parents. What do you know about
                        your father's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: My father was known as W.C. White, William Clarence White. He was a piano
                    tuner and technician, organ repairer, and musician. He came up, he was born in
                    the south, I think he was born in Kentucky. He played piano in silent movie
                    theaters. He became a piano tuner because he was working in a German piano
                    factory, a German-owned piano factory, as the stringer. His job was to put the
                    big strings in the bottom and the little strings on the top. At one point the
                    piano tuner was ill and my father tuned all the pianos in his absence and when
                    the piano tuner came back he was surprised that my father had done a better job
                    than he could do. And so he taught him the trade and then said, “If you'll just
                    leave town so you're not in competition with me, then I'll be happy.” So my
                    father started from the south, heading north, tuning pianos and playing in
                    silent movie theaters, getting enough money in one town to buy gas to get to
                    another town, on his way, with my mother, to California but when they got as far
                    as Indiana they found a lot of work and were happy to just stay there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, too, there was an era which is a little
                        different from today, when every house and we're talking about the smallest
                        farmhouse, had a piano because, for one thing, there wasn't anything else
                        and people would sit around the piano and they'd make somebody, usually a
                        daughter but often all the kids took piano lessons and they played the
                        piano, sat around and sang.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. My father was born in 1890. So we're talking about a time
                    when, well before television and the kind of entertainment we have with movies.
                    He also, of course, encountered a lot of prejudice. So in those days, when he
                    started tuning pianos from town to town every church and every school had a
                    piano and that was his domain for a long time. But, like you just said, he
                    figured out that every home had a piano. His question was how he could get into
                    those homes to tune pianos, being a black man and he figured out a way. He hired
                    a man named Mr. Rowe, a white guy and Mr. Rowe became his front man. So they
                    would drive up to a house, Rowe would knock on the door and say, “Excuse me,
                    ma'am, do you have a piano?” “Yes.” “Does it need tuning?” “Of course.” “Well, I
                    can tune it.” They agreed on a price and everything and he would then say, “But
                    there's just one thing. See, I'm not the piano tuner. That fellow out there in
                    the car is the piano tuner. But you don't have to worry. I have a pistol right
                    here at my side and you don't have to worry that he is going to do anything
                    wrong.” And that way he would get in and tune a piano.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indiana and the farm country had a reputation as the
                        center of the Ku Klux Klan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The biggest KKK state outside of the solid south. Many Grand Dragons have
                    come from Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah and it's hard to visualize today but this was big
                        stuff. What do you know about your father's parentage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't know a lot because he was so old when I was born that my
                    grandparents were already dead. So I know their names and I know where they were
                    from. I know that his father worked in a coal mine, as he did as well, when he
                    was young. The coal mine collapsed on him and broke his back, my father but
                    that's just about all I know about my grandparents on that side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on your mother's side, now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WHITE: On my mother's side, that family grew up in Alabama. They were Creek
                    Indians. They were sharecroppers. One of my joys as a kid was, we would take a
                    pilgrimage in the summer down to Alabama and stay with these Creek Indians, who
                    lived in houses up on stilts because the Tombigbee River flooded. And anytime
                    the water was high the pigs and chickens and everyone would come up in the house
                    with them. So that side of the family, they were very poor, sharecroppers and
                    Indians. An amazing thing happened to them. When I started going down there in
                    the Forties they barely spoke standard English. I couldn't understand what they
                    said and their world was that little community that they lived in. Then they all
                    got federal money for being Indians and that federal money brought with it
                    trailers and electricity and within just a matter of years they were living in a
                    world like I lived in and the kids were talking the same kind of language that I
                    spoke. So that was an amazing transformation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just an isolated group or were they part of a
                        larger Indian community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Right. It was not a reservation or anything like that but they were
                    isolated families who stayed in Alabama when people were moved to Oklahoma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Andrew Jackson's time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Exactly. They essentially hid in the woods and stayed there and became
                    sharecroppers. So there wasn't a broad sense of community but I understand a lot
                    more about them now than I did at the time I was growing up, because working in
                    Guatemala and Mexico with Mayan Indians out in the jungles there now, they live
                    just like my family did in Alabama and I could see many more ties and Indian
                    things in the way the lived now than I could when I was growing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, back to your parents, did they stay in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They eventually stayed in Brazil, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, before your birth and all but what were they
                        talking about being, I guess your mother was considered Indian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: My mother was considered Indian and my father black and my mother brought
                    her sister with her to Brazil, Indiana, from Alabama and her sister was as
                    Caucasian as anyone you could ever see: white skin, blonde hair. Clearly, we
                    were a family different from anyone else in Brazil, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get, were there any stories from your family about
                        settling there and being this unusual family, particularly in rural Indiana
                        at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think probably the stories start with my father, who at a very
                    young age saw his younger brother, his name was Romy, apparently Romy was coming
                    home from school one day and looked at a white girl across the street, this was
                    in Kentucky, looked at her the wrong way or something. And later a gang of white
                    kids with baseball bats showed up at the house and beat him and actually he went
                    into a coma and died. So in our family history there was this very ugly event
                    that happened then, that I didn't hear about until maybe I was a teenager. My
                    parents didn't talk about it until then.</p>
                <p>So that was one thing. The other thing that loomed large was that on their trip
                    from Alabama, town by town, heading for California, they stopped first at
                    Vincennes, Indiana, which is right on the border with Kentucky, I think and my
                    dad was doing very well there as a piano tuner and my mother was working as a
                    maid in a wealthy house and they were trying to settle there. Apparently they
                    were tired of traveling. And there was a blind piano tuner, a white man there,
                    who had a cross burned on my father's yard to tell him that he was not welcome
                    in Vincennes. So they moved to Brazil, Indiana.</p>
                <p>So there's that kind of racial history in our family that I found particularly
                    interesting as a teenager, because I was starting to feel rebellious and very
                    angry at my father who would always say, “Yes sir” and “No ma'am” to everyone.
                    When he went into a house to tune a piano he would say, “Excuse me, ma'am, do
                    you mind if I smoke in your house?” at a time when no one asked that, they just
                    did it. So I felt that he was so subservient and he had had so much in his
                    history that I just couldn't understand it and I grew up being very angry
                    because I thought that he was far too subservient to the people around him. His
                    argument was, “What has happened has happened. These people here that I'm
                    dealing with had nothing to do with it and I treat everyone, whether they're
                    black, yellow, or green the same way. I say “Yes ma'am' and “No ma'am” and “Yes
                    sir” and “No sir” to everyone. That's just my nature.” But I couldn't understand
                    that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how about growing up, as a kid? I take it that there
                        was no, or maybe there was, a black community or whatever you want to call
                        it in Brazil at the time? Or was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WHITE: There was a small black community there because Brazil, Indiana was the
                    clay center of the world. It made architectural tile. Brazil is located in Clay
                    County and the cities around there were Clay City, Coal City, Coalmont, Coal
                    Bluff and I could go on for a long time. So there was a small black population
                    that came there to work in the plant that made the architectural tile. They
                    essentially lived in one part of town called Stringtown and we lived kind of on
                    the border of Stringtown, right at the edge of Stringtown. So there was a small
                    black community. We were, again, we not kind of only living on the margins of
                    the two communities but on the margins of that community. We somehow bridged the
                    gap, because my father, instead of working in the tile factory like all the
                    other blacks did, was an independent businessman that had a, he was middle
                    class. Everyone else was definitely not. So we were kind of on the margins of
                    all of that.</p>
                <p>In school, the one thing that was good about Brazil was that the school really
                    had no prejudice in it. I was given every opportunity in school to do whatever I
                    wanted and I did a lot. I played in the band, I played football, I ran track, I
                    was in the Thespian Club and I was a very good student. Outside of that,
                    socially there was a lot of prejudice in Brazil. So you didn't see the black
                    kids at school dances and proms and things like that. Inside of school was one
                    thing, outside of school was a different set of values.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of inherit your father's musical ear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I didn't. I was ordered to take piano lessons when I was a kid, like many
                    kids in those days but I preferred to play football. So I didn't really show any
                    interest in music or any talent until I was in high school, when I joined a rock
                    'n roll band. After that, I spent more time learning the piano. I also played
                    trombone in the school orchestra but I didn't really ever have the talent that
                    he had. He was truly a musician's musician. He could play all the stringed
                    instruments and while he played piano and really did that very well, the
                    mandolin was what he was just a virtuoso at. He could make the mandolin, he
                    could make people cry. He would do songs like Listen to the Mockingbird and he
                    would make the mandolin sound just like a mockingbird. He was really, really a
                    musician. So I wish now I had maybe paid more attention to him but at the time I
                    was too angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home, what was life like in the family?</hi>

                <p>WHITE: Life was nice in one sense in that my parents, I think my father spent one
                    night away from my mother in all of the years that they were married, because he
                    was on a hung jury and didn't come home that night. He was very old fashioned,
                    in that he didn't show emotion. So there was no lovey-dovey, hand holding,
                    kissing. I don't think I ever heard my father say a word of praise to me about
                    my school work or playing football or anything. He was not an emotional person
                    but he was a very good person. Never saw him drink, never heard him swear. His
                    one vice was that he was a chain smoker. Rolled his own with one hand, Prince
                    Albert tobacco and Rizla papers and as he was finishing one he was rolling
                    another. Other than that, he was a very good man but not emotional.</p>
                <p>My mother, on the other hand, was, everyone loved her. She grew flowers, she
                    painted pictures that people would come by the house to buy, oil paintings. She
                    was very outgoing and social; he was very quiet and hardly said a word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother sort of the power behind the family, as
                        far as pushing you towards school and education and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, up to a point. Certainly my father was not. My father felt that he
                    had established a really good business and that as a son I should take over the
                    family business. He knew that I did really well in school and that I was
                    interested in going to college and he tried hard to persuade me to just spend a
                    few years working with him and take over his business and then go to college if
                    you want. My mother had always encouraged me to do well in school. In fact, she
                    taught me to read before I went to first grade, reading me Zane Grey books and
                    having me read them to her. But when it came time to go to college she was also
                    reticent. They had had eight boys in a row before me, all stillborn, and I was
                    number nine and an only child. My dad was in his fifties and she was in her very
                    late forties, maybe, when I was born. So going to college seemed to be okay
                    until she learned that I wanted to go to California to go to college. As an only
                    child I wanted to put some space between me and my parents and see if I could
                    survive on the outside. So she was not happy that I was going to California but,
                    yes, she was certainly the person who pushed me academically to excel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in the house? You sit around at the dinner table
                        talking about politics or religion or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WHITE: Probably not. I think we, around the family dinner table, for one thing
                    the sister that she brought, my mother brought from Alabama, had seven kids, six
                    or seven kids and they were dirt poor and they lived with us a lot of the time,
                    a lot of the kids did. So at any time there were three or four almost brothers
                    and sisters around the house and that livened things up and gave me someone to
                    play with. It also meant that at the table we really did not talk current
                    affairs or politics or religion. We talked more about natural things, about the
                    garden. We had a fish pond, a goldfish pond. My mother loved to fish and tried
                    to fish every day. So we talked about those kinds of things. Going in the woods,
                    hunting berries and nuts. It was not until I went away to college that I started
                    to understand that there was this broader world out there that people talked
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the family fall, say religiously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's a good question. My father was a Christian Scientist. Not a
                    church-going person but he believed in Christian Science and he'd never, until
                    he really got sick with both a heart attack and emphysema did he ever see a
                    doctor for the first time, right at the end of his life. My mother, like many
                    Indians, worshipped nature. She was not a church-going person. When I was four
                    or five years old they decided that I should go to church and make up my own
                    mind. And so they let me go with any of the neighbors. They insisted that I go
                    to church every Sunday. I found the Nazarene Church to my liking. A lot of my
                    friends my age were going to the Nazarene Church, so I went there for most of my
                    younger life and actually was recruited really hard to go to Nazarene Church
                    college to be a preacher at the time when I was thinking about college. So I had
                    a very active religious life but my family was not a part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically, was there a political cast to your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I certainly heard my mother say over and over that she had never
                    voted anything except the Democratic ticket and she would trace that back to, I
                    guess to Roosevelt, to Truman to a certain extent. I don't remember the details
                    but, yes, she was very clear that she was a Democrat. I never heard my father
                    mention politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I was an avid reader. As I mentioned, I was reading Zane Grey novels
                    before I went to the first grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zane Grey was a very popular writer of western
                        stories.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WHITE: The Riders of the Purple Sage, I had read a lot of that out loud to my
                    mother before I ever went to the first grade. We had a ten o'clock lights out
                    policy in our house, so I often could be found under the covers with a
                    flashlight. How do you justify getting all of those batteries all of the time?
                    No, when you grow up in a place where you don't quite fit into the social
                    structure, you don't quite fit anything and you're essentially an only child,
                    although I did have all those cousins to play with, life was pretty lonely. I
                    found very early on that I could travel around the world in books, so I read
                    everything I could get my hands on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, you say that the school was, you didn't feel
                        prejudice at the school. How did you find the school? It was part of the
                        Indiana public school system, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, I think, looking back on it now, it was a good place to go to
                    school. I think I got a really solid education from a few teachers who were
                    outstanding. I think of my science teacher, Mr. Mosher, who was just
                    outstanding. He could have taught in any college anywhere. On the other hand,
                    there were other teachers who were, the football coach or the basketball coach
                    taught history or geography and didn't have a clue. I remember when I joined
                    International Voluntary Services and I was going to Laos I saw my high school
                    geography teacher who also worked at the swimming pool in the summers. I said,
                    “Mr. Grant, I'm going to Laos as a volunteer” and he had no idea where Laos was.
                    He was a geography teacher. So there were two sides to it but I could point to
                    five or six teachers who were master teachers, who certainly guided my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In school, were particularly white girls out of bounds,
                        more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Oh, absolutely, there's just no, there was no socializing between whites
                    and blacks that way. That was just something you didn't even think about growing
                    up in those days, especially with our family history, with Romy, my father's
                    younger brother who had been killed for that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about, what was your impression of, since you
                        were sort of on the periphery of two communities, what was your impression
                        of the small black community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILSON: I guess, I haven't thought about but my sense was that they, that like
                    any community there was a whole range of people. There was a guy named Bill
                    Wilburne, who I think in World War II he drove an ambulance in the military and
                    came back and he was a drunkard. When you saw Bill he was always staggering down
                    the middle of the street or falling off the sidewalk, on his way to the Dew Drop
                    Inn to buy a bottle of wine. So he was one extreme of that community and
                    probably my father was at the other extreme of being totally conscientious,
                    dedicated to his work and all of that. But most people fit more towards my
                    father's side in that they were hard workers; working in the architectural tile
                    plant is not an easy job. Almost all the women worked as maids in peoples'
                    houses, so everybody had two jobs. Almost all of the families were two parent
                    families. Most of them had a large number of kids and so they struggled. The
                    kids were always dressed, even if they all had hand-me-downs. So clearly there
                    was poverty in that community but there was also a sense of community, since
                    they were physically part of Stringtown.</p>
                <p>I haven't lived in a community because I've been overseas so much, but there's a
                    bit of a sense of community here. We know all of our neighbors, we have
                    community parties. And certainly all of the blacks in Brazil, Indiana went to
                    the same church. I think it was the Baptist or Methodist church. I didn't but
                    the community went there and there were community events and there was a sense
                    of community, there was a sense that if a kid was out doing something that he
                    shouldn't do, someone would get on the telephone and call his mother and let her
                    know. So there were strictures that kept the community together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have a problem being attracted to the pool
                        house crowd or whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yeah, in a small, rural town you didn't have the kind of vices that you
                    have elsewhere. I don't think I ever heard a term like marijuana or anything
                    like that until I was in college. Occasionally you'd see Tommy Grissom, who
                    played on the football team, smoking a cigarette and that was really something,
                    to see an athlete actually hiding behind a telephone pole smoking a cigarette.
                    That was the kind of vice that existed in that place.</p>
                <p>The benefits of a small town. We would go on vacation, we were lucky because my
                    father was self-employed, so for a couple of months in the summer we would just
                    get in the car and travel, primarily because my mother loved the Pacific
                    Northwest. She loved the mountains and fishing and all that and my father loved
                    Indiana, the flat plains there, because he had a good job. So the agreement that
                    they reached was that for a couple of months every year we'd go out to where my
                    mother enjoyed. So when we did that, we would leave the house open. We never
                    locked our doors, even if we were gone for two months and never even thought
                    that someone would come in the house and steal anything and of course no one
                    ever did. So it was a different world in those days and part of it was rural
                    Indiana. Rural Indiana, when I go back there now, it's still a lot like it was
                    when I grew up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In school, what sort of courses grabbed you and what
                        courses didn't grab you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Everything grabbed me. I loved school. For twelve years I had perfect
                    attendance. Never missed a day of school. Sick, rain, shine, sleet, hail, I had
                    to go to school. I loved it. I was in a post-Sputnik high school, so I had
                    ripped away from me history and English and civics and all of those subjects, to
                    be replaced by Russian and analytical geometry and calculus and all of that.
                    [Ed: On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union sent into orbit Sputnik 1, the first
                    artificial satellite in history. Sputnik's launch came as an unnerving surprise
                    to the United States. The space age had dawned and America's Cold War rival
                    suddenly appeared technologically superior. This event sparked considerable
                    emphasis on education.] But I loved those and the high school science teacher
                    was just a master teacher. So I left high school thinking that I was going to
                    probably major in astrophysics. And I did start my college career studying
                    science and astrophysics, but I quickly moved away from that because there was
                    just too many temptations out there, things to study. So I thought, I'll move
                    away from science, where I had no electives for four years, one every year and
                    I'll just take a year or so of psychology and art and social science and all the
                    things I want to do and then I'll go back to science. But I never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: 1959.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I kind of felt like I was a separate unit, with close ties, as I mentioned
                    we had this small rock 'n roll band that I played in and those guys were my
                    really close friends and then I was a captain on the football team and I ran
                    track and our football team was undefeated our senior year. And so that was a
                    big part of my life and some of the football players were fairly close to me but
                    in general I felt that I was a lone wolf, partaking here and partaking there but
                    not being a part of anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you said that you started looking at California.
                        Where'd you go and what attracted you to where you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think probably when I was in junior high school I read a book by
                    Lafcadio Hearn [27 June 1850- 26 September 1904] about Japan and sort of not
                    feeling a part of anything, when I read that book I really fell in love with
                    Japan. I found a way to get Japanese pen pals and I had seven or eight pen pals
                    that I wrote to and I loved things Japan. So I decided that when I said I was
                    going to head towards Japan and the closest place to start was California. And
                    so that's how I picked California. I actually had a four-year scholarship to the
                    University of Michigan. I went up, I looked at the campus, I was really
                    impressed, but it was just too close to home. We had a summer home in Michigan
                    and had I gone there my parents would have probably moved to their summer home
                    and then I would have been coming home every weekend. So I just decided
                    California's where I want to go. I started at Berkeley. I hated Berkeley, it was
                    far too big. My freshman English class was larger than my hometown. And so I
                    moved to Sacramento State, which is a small school. I felt comfortable there. I
                    spent a lot of time in California and thinking of things Japanese.</p>
                <p>I spent two years at Sac State and my father started to get ill and I came back
                    to Indiana and went to college, my final two years, at Valparaiso University in
                    northern Indiana, a really good school, the largest Lutheran university so
                    they're able to attract Lutheran professors from around the world. It was a
                    small school. I was able to play football and run track there, which I enjoyed.
                    I played in the band at university, in the symphony. And I majored in psychology
                    and art and I had a minor in math, because I had taken all those science courses
                    before, so I had a lot of math. I enjoyed Valparaiso and it was there that the
                    dean of my school was a Nipponophile. He loved Japan. Every summer he went to
                    Japan. So when I was talking to him about graduate school he mentioned the
                    East-West Center as maybe a possibility and I had not really thought about
                    Hawaii but he made it sound very attractive. So I applied and I was
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>So then I went to Hawaii and from Hawaii I majored in Asian Studies and went to
                    Asia. So I eventually got to where I was interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, let's go back to Sacramento State. How did you find
                        it? Did it have an Asiatic focus at all there or were you able to get much
                        out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, I don't think so. I think that Sac State, my memories of Sac State
                    were just how hard I worked. I had a job I think at the Bureau of Motor
                    Vehicles, purging old records of drivers' licenses. I worked as a cleaning
                    person in the dormitories, running a buffing machine and I studied hard. So I
                    was really struggling to have enough money to go to school and didn't do very
                    much there. I remember one time I thought about playing flag football. I was
                    really missing, I was an athlete and I determined I just didn't have time to do
                    that. I didn't live on campus, I lived off campus in a boarding house and all of
                    the people in the boarding house were construction guys working on the Donner
                    Pass highway. So I wasn't very connected to Sac State and there was certainly
                    not anything very Asian there, but I often went to San Francisco, where I spent
                    a lot of time in Japan Town and Chinatown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any stories, 'although this is before
                        sort of attention was focused on it, the wartime relocation of the Japanese
                        from California. Were you getting any insight there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, not really. I recall having a few close Japanese friends and I don't
                    think that subject even came up at the time, although that was probably a hot
                    topic. It just that it didn't come up with me. People might have preferred not
                    to talk about it. What I did have, in Sacramento, there was an ice cream parlor
                    close to the boarding house that I stayed in and I would often go there to
                    study. And I met a guy, I don't remember his last name. His first name was
                    Victor and he was a Jewish kid who clearly grew up like I did, sort of an
                    outcast, he didn't have any friends. And we became friends because he played
                    chess and I played chess. And I learned a lot from Victor, about other people
                    view the world. For instance, how he and his family viewed black people. He was
                    amazed that I had body hair. He had always thought that black people didn't have
                    any body hair. And one day he looked at my arm and he said, “My God, you have
                    hair!” That was a revelation to him. We went to his apartment and he said,
                    “Mother, mother, come and look!” Again, I had grown up perhaps not spending any
                    time,...in Brazil, Indiana you didn't go to peoples' houses, I didn't, as a
                    black person and spend time and see how other families reacted. I had never
                    really been in another family, other than my own family, until Sacramento, when
                    I went to Victor's house and I saw how he lived and I started to learn some
                    things that way. I didn't have any, say, Japanese friends that I was that close
                    to, that I could've had conversations with. So, yeah, the subject of the wartime
                    relocation did not come up.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>What did come up, interestingly enough, was Mexican migrant workers. That came up
                    because a guy at the boarding house I lived in named Harry Moss was an artist.
                    He had no money at all. He was living in a closet in the boarding house because
                    the boarding house lady liked him and let him just sleep and the closet was just
                    big enough for him to just sleep in. But Harry was, he liked to get involved in
                    his painting and he was painting Mexican workers with short handled hoes in hops
                    fields and he would go down and work in the hops fields with them so he could
                    really understand them so he could paint them better. That was the first time I
                    had been exposed to Mexican migrant workers and through Harry I learned a lot
                    about their trips to the hops fields and then to the black cherries in Michigan,
                    the whole circuit that they followed in those days. So that was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, Valparaiso, what was it like? Was it different
                        than Sacramento State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, it was very different, in that I lived on campus, I was in a
                    fraternity, I played in the band, I played football, I ran track. So I was part
                    of the university there, unlike Sac State where probably no one on campus even
                    knew who I was. At Valpo everyone knew me because I was involved in so many
                    activities. It was probably at Valpo that for the first time that I took a
                    drink. Again, I was in a little band and one day someone in the band had
                    blackberry brandy. And I had never had a beer, never had anything, I just had
                    never been even interested in experimenting but for whatever reason that day in
                    the bandstand he was passing around this blackberry brandy and I got drunk for
                    the first time. So that happened at Valpo. More than that, I had probably never,
                    throughout high school and my two years in California, I'd never had a date.
                    That was just not a part of the social structure in Indiana and then at Sac
                    State I was just too busy working and everything, didn't have that on my mind.
                    When I got to Valpo I was more a part of the campus and the social life and all
                    that. I did start dating. So that's really late in life, I think, a junior in
                    college. I was at Valpo from 1962 to 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, early on at all get caught up in sort of the
                        election of 1960 and Kennedy and all that? Did that touch you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Barely at all. One of the things, in those days, that I prided myself in
                    was being apolitical. The thing I stayed away from was all the student political
                    organizations and all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up anything about the Cold War, the
                        Soviet Union and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WHITE: Just on the margins. Clearly, I went to a post-Sputnik school and so
                    there's the sense that there's a competition with Russia but that was not a part
                    of my life at that time. It just wasn't part of what I thought about or dealt
                    with. Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. I was at Valpo then. I recall I
                    was...I had moved out of the student dorm and we had an apartment right at the
                    edge of the campus and I was cooking in the kitchen when I heard that Kennedy
                    had died and I remember going to the campus and it was like everybody had there
                    was wondering what would happen next. So that was a big thing. But the whole of
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis [October 1962], all of these things that happened about
                    that time was not anything that I spent any time thinking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated from Valpo in 1964 and went on to the
                        East-West Center that fall. What was the attraction of the East-West
                        Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, it was a graduate school in East Asian Studies and most of the
                    Americans majored in East Asian Studies, either China or Japan, although there
                    were a few students that studied Southeast Asia or the South Pacific. It was
                    basically putting American graduate students into those programs with peak
                    funding from the Congress, probably because of the Vietnam War and you had an
                    Asian roommate. Your Asian roommate generally was studying something else. My
                    roommate was a Japanese guy. I was studying Japanese. It was a reasonable
                    graduate school for East Asian Studies and maybe for oceanography and other
                    things. Not a powerhouse, but the East-West Center itself, because it was very
                    well funded, was able to attract visiting lecturers and important people from
                    Asia and the United States and there was a lot of research going on. So it was
                    an exciting place academically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were going there and Valparaiso also, did
                        Vietnam and our involvement there raise much interest with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Not really. Clearly there were people starting to protest. Again, that was
                    the kind of thing I had no interest in and stayed away from. Hawaii became a
                    training center for people going to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. So on the
                    margins I heard more about Southeast Asia there and started to have a growing
                    interest in Southeast Asia, but I was still really an East Asia person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, you were taking Japanese at this point.
                        How did you find Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was really hard for me. Most of the kids in my beginning Japanese class
                    were Nisei and Sansei and already had a smattering of the language. So I was
                    starting from zero and they were not. So I found it very hard. I had a Japanese
                    girlfriend, so I was able to learn a lot from her.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she Japanese Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Japanese Japanese, at the East-West Center, yeah. She was a Japanese
                    student from Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to be careful that you didn't learn feminine
                        Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's what I learned. I learned feminine Japanese from her and also in
                    Hawaii of course they speak a very antiquated Japanese from the southern islands
                    of Japan, like it was spoken 150 years ago. So between those two, when I got to
                    Japan I had to relearn a lot of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view you were getting of Japan at this
                        particular point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think before I went to Japan the view I had was probably through
                    rose-colored glasses, from Lafcadio Hearne on through just everything I read
                    about Japan. I was getting a kind of maybe really nice view of Japan, but it all
                    changed when I went there. As part of the East-West Center program I went to
                    Japan and I quickly found that it was very hard being different in Japan, that
                    everybody was the same and if you had a dark skin that really made you a gaijin,
                    an outsider. If I told people my name was Mr. White, they'd say, “Oh, Mr. Black,
                    it's very nice to meet you.” Color was just on their minds and the difference
                    was just far more than I could have ever thought of and being a poor university
                    student made it even worse, because you had no status. So I was pretty
                    disappointed in Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you went to Japan when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was there for a couple of months but I also went, on that same trip, as
                    part of the East-West Center program I went to Southeast Asia. Our group went to
                    Singapore. This was at the time that Singapore and Malaysia started to have the
                    issue. We went to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, then to Bangkok and then up to Chiang
                    Mai. And that was the first time I'd been exposed to Southeast Asian culture and
                    having just been really whipped by Japan I couldn't believe how gracious the
                    Thai were, especially the northeast Thai. That's when I decided that I'd spent
                    enough time worrying about East Asia, I'm going to become a Southeast Asianist
                    and when I graduate from the East-West Center I'm going to find a way to go work
                    in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, while you were at the East-West Center could you
                        switch subjects or were you still focused on Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was still focused on Japan but, yeah,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul, looking at a letter you wrote to us, I don't believe
                        you mentioned the role of Ralph Bunche. Is this a place to do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Sure. I think this fits fine. The reason I was at the East-West Center is
                    that the dean of my school, Valparaiso University, loved Japan, traveled there
                    every summer and I was consulting with him about what I should do next with my
                    life and he found out that I had this love of Japan. He suggested I go to the
                    East-West Center. It required a couple of letters of reference and the dean
                    suggested I find some prominent black person to write a letter for me and I
                    didn't know anyone. The most prominent black person I knew was my father and he
                    had a second grade education. So, we hit on the idea of writing to Ralph Bunche
                    and just sending him my transcripts and</p>
                <p>He was Undersecretary for Special Political affairs in the UN at that time. So we
                    found the address and we sent a letter and he wrote a letter of reference for
                    me, which was very helpful in getting me into the East-West Center. So that's
                    how I got to the East-West Center to start with. There, at the Center, I had a
                    choice or majoring in East Asian Studies, Japan or China, and I chose Japan
                    because I loved Japan. As I look back now from my perspective, I wish I had
                    studied Chinese instead of Japanese but that's water under the bridge, as they
                    say. Anyway, I left the East-West Center in 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I came to Washington and applied for various jobs with anyone I could
                    think of that worked in Southeast Asia. And I was not having very much luck and
                    I ran into, just by accident on the street, someone from the East-West Center
                    that I knew, Jack Parmetier, who had signed on with the International Voluntary
                    Services to go to Laos. He talked to me about pursuing that, I did and I ended
                    up joining IVS and went to Laos as a volunteer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the IVS. What sort of organization was it in
                        the Sixties?</hi>

                <p>WHITE: When I joined, it was a church-based group, a Quakers group that was
                    essentially used...a lot of the IVSers were conscientious objectors who didn't
                    mind going to Southeast Asia but didn't want to fight. It was, I assume, mostly
                    funded by USAID in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. They also had people in Iran and
                    Iraq, other places around the world but the largest number of people were in
                    Southeast Asia. It was...when I joined it, the IVSers were essentially out on
                    the front lines, in Laos anyway. They were out in the forward areas and were
                    very dedicated to doing whatever it was that they did— agriculture, health,
                    education. At some point during the Sixties IVS became more of a...started
                    leaning towards being anti-government, anti-our mission in Southeast Asia and
                    eventually rejected all U.S. government funding and automatically reduced down
                    to a tiny, tiny group of people that continued to work and hung together as IVS
                    but very small, just a shadow of its former self.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you were doing it it was</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Large, active, directly working under USAID supervision, under the area
                    coordinators in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of training did you get before you went
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had an interesting few weeks of training in Washington. The academic
                    training, so to speak, was cross-cultural in nature. They had an anthropologist
                    on staff who did a lot to talk about how you work in foreign cultures. We
                    received intensive Lao language training. It was like ten hours a day at Berlitz
                    or one of the contract schools, for just a week or ten days. It wasn't a long
                    language-training program. They did language training in country. And that was
                    essentially it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Laos...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was in Laos from '66 to '73, more or less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go initially?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WHITE: Initially I went to Vientiane, where I was put on the education team for
                    IVS and I worked at Dong Dok, which was the local university, I think teaching
                    English. But my original agreement with IVS was that I would go up country to
                    work with the Hmong and that's what I was looking to do. When I got to Laos they
                    said, “Well, you really don't have much choice. There's an education team and a
                    rural development team and none of them work up in the area that you want to go
                    to” up where the Hmong were. So it took me a number of months to negotiate to
                    get up country to where I wanted to work. In that interim period, while they
                    were working on that, I worked at the local university. I also was assigned for
                    a while to work with the Asia Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Laos in 1966 when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was a very confused country. You had neutralists, the rightists, the
                    Pathet Lao and it was hard to tell at any given day what group of warlords were
                    on what side. So there was active fighting in the countryside and very quiet in
                    the cities at that point. The guerilla warfare there, which was associated with
                    the Vietnam war, was essentially warfare out in the areas bordering Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the battles of, I think of Kong Le, between the
                        generals, had that already happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The Kong Le thing had already happened. The essential, the struggles for
                    the Plain of Jars, the real struggles with the North Vietnamese, were yet to
                    come. And that's, of course, the area I worked in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were an American working for a voluntary NGO
                        (non-government organization). What was the official American presence there
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: As I best understood it, the official American presence was a group called
                    CORDS [Ed: Civil Operations and Revolutionary Support was a counter-insurgency
                    program based in Vietnam, not Laos]. That was a coordinated government body that
                    folded State and AID, CIA, the military attach�s all into one group that was
                    called CORDS. So a lot of people lost their designation while they were in Laos.
                    It was a very large mission there, probably the second largest in the world,
                    next to Vietnam would be my guess. There were a lot of Americans there,
                    including groups like IVS that were essentially contractors to the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your initial, you spent a considerable amount of
                        time, seven years. What was your initial impression of the Laotians that you
                        were making contact with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WHITE: Before I went up country? Well, before I went up country my impression was
                    that Laos was a very happy place. There was no evidence that I could see in and
                    around Vientiane of the war, except you would see occasionally soldiers on the
                    street. But working out at the university or working with the Asian Foundation,
                    where I essentially worked with Buddhist monks, my impression, and this was with
                    the lowland Lao, that they were extremely easy-going people, very friendly and
                    open to me, which is something I was looking for after having gone to Japan, the
                    place that I loved so much and found that there was a lot of prejudice there. I
                    didn't find any of that in Laos, so I felt very comfortable there.</p>
                <p>So, at Dong Dok University I taught English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students, as students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Not very excited as students. They were not burning the house down to
                    learn English. Laos was essentially a French colony and French was the language
                    that was used in academia. So there were a smattering of students interested in
                    English. But also I was there only part-time, knowing that I would soon leave
                    there, soon as a got an assignment. So I never got fully attached or involved
                    with the university. The people on the education team that worked there
                    certainly formed a core of people that were very interested in English and the
                    American way of life and have wonderful memories of that time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you went up country, where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I went to Sam Thong, which was right at the southern edge of the Plain of
                    Jars. It was the capital, Sam Thong and Muang Xaing are too adjacent towns that
                    were kind of the seat of the secret army of General Vang Pao and where most of
                    the activity in northern Laos took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I originally went there to teach in a teacher training school. The valley
                    of Sam Thong was a seat of Zhou Quang, who was the local governor of that area
                    and it also had a teacher training school that was for the Hmong people. So
                    originally I taught, I started teaching English but I'm really not a teacher at
                    heart, so I quickly changed my assignment to helping the teachers build school
                    furniture and improve the school infrastructure and things like that. So I spent
                    most of my time working on community projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at the time of the relationship
                        between the lowland Lao and the Hmong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WHITE: There were, clearly there were a lot of bad feelings in the lowland Lao
                    about the Hmong. They felt the Hmong were dirty, uneducated. I learned a lot
                    about that because as I learned Lao up country I learned Lao with a Hmong
                    accent, so even when I would go down to Vientiane or other parts of Laos and
                    speak Lao, people right away would detect that I lived with the Hmong and I
                    heard lots of negative comments about the Hmong. There also is not a lot of
                    opportunity for interaction between the Hmong and the Lao, because they really
                    did live in very different places and Laos was a country with no roads. The only
                    way you could really get around is by airplane. So there wasn't the friction
                    because there wasn't the social contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you were, was this almost strictly Hmong, or were
                        the lowland Lao sort of holding administrative positions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, it was strictly Hmong. All the administrative positions, from the
                    governor, the governor was a Lao, Chao Xicome, but almost all of the
                    administrative positions were held by Hmong. The person I worked with was the
                    director of the school system for northeast Laos. He was a Hmong. The governor,
                    while he was a Lao, he wasn't a lowland Lao. He was from that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard since many Lao and many Hmong ended up in
                        Minnesota and places like that, that there was a real problem because they
                        didn't have an alphabet or whatever. In other words, that they really hadn't
                        received much, their culture just did not prepare them to move easily into
                        the Western world. Is that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, the Hmong, certainly, were among the most primitive of the people in
                    Laos. There were probably some hill tribes that were even more primitive but the
                    Hmong basically lived in an area with no transportation, with no cash economy,
                    with no written language other than written language that missionaries had
                    developed for them that were only known by a few people. So that's why when they
                    came here as refugees they were found in Golden Gate Park still hunting for
                    squirrel with crossbows. The people that came here were rural people with no
                    education. But that has changed so much. I went to a function for General Vang
                    Pao a couple of years ago in Wisconsin, a tribute to him paid by the Hmong and
                    you could look out across this large valley and see three kinds of people. You
                    could see the old Lao or the Hmong in their Hmong costumes, the women with their
                    parasols and still with their silver necklaces on. And then you could see the
                    soldiers, 'cause the Hmong army still exists and they were wearing camouflage
                    fatigues and all that. And then you could see these young Hmong who grew up in
                    the United States, who've had a Western education and who were now doctors and
                    lawyers and some local politicians, some airplane pilots. There were three
                    groups out there, it was just incredible to see. And for me, having lived for
                    that long with the Hmong, it was incredible to see these young kids who speak
                    fluent English and are Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, in the area you were, what was the
                        military situation and how were the Hmong being used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The military situation was pretty difficult. The U.S. policy was that the
                    Hmong essentially were to hold defensive positions, not to be offensive. So
                    there was a strong desire on the part of General Vang Pao and others, for
                    instance, to take the Plain of Jars. And there were a couple of incursions where
                    local commanders in fact overran North Vietnamese positions or Pathet Lao
                    positions and were asked to retreat back by us because we wouldn't supply them.
                    So that was one aspect to the war, that there were a lot of rules of engagement
                    that made it difficult for the Hmong.</p>
                <p>The security in and around where we were was basically difficult as well. There
                    were North Vietnamese troops in northeast Laos, not just Pathet Lao. Northeast
                    Laos, where we worked with refugees, we would overfly enemy positions to work
                    with refugees. So we were constantly being shot at as we flew around that area
                    and a number of the officers, operations officers, in the area where I worked
                    were killed in action. There were no U.S. military people there other than one
                    official military advisor. So it was a bunch of civilians out in a very dicey
                    area. I worked for Pop Buell, who is a quite famous AID (Agency for
                    International Development) type that worked in northeast Laos for many, many
                    years and did, essentially after I left the school I did refugee work. He had a
                    number of Americans, five or six, who worked with refugees or worked in the
                    health system in northeast Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to begin with you were sort of working really in the
                        school in what could be called I suppose the support/admin area. How long
                        did that continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WHITE: I worked in the school for,...Pop Buell was a tough guy and he wanted his
                    ops officers to speak the language and accept the conditions of flying out and
                    working behind enemy lines and all of that. So he had a way of testing people
                    and it was basically to throw them over to the school and not pay any attention
                    to them and to check with the Hmong every once in a while to see how they were
                    doing. So that's where I was and at one point one of the ops officers, Don
                    Shustrom, was killed by the North Vietnamese and Pop came over and said, “Would
                    you like to come up to the airstrip and work on refugee relief and
                    rehabilitation replacing Don Shustrom?” So that took place maybe a year or so
                    after I started working at the school. Around that same time a number of IVSers
                    in these forward areas were killed in fights and IVS decided to withdraw all of
                    its forward area people down to the capital. And at that time Pop Buell came to
                    me and said, “Would you like to work here or would you like to go to the
                    capital?” I said, “I'd like to work here” so Pop got on the singlesideband and
                    called the AID director, Charlie Mann, said, “I've got a fellow here who's about
                    to quit IVS and I want to put him on an AID contract” and that was the
                    negotiation, the extent of it. So I became a contractor to AID and eventually
                    became an AID direct hire while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the year you were working with the school you were
                        working in which language, was it Lao or was it Hmong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I chose Lao, because it had broader use and the school system was in
                    Lao. I learned some Hmong but essentially the language that I used was Lao.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after a year, that takes us to 1967, 1968, then you
                        moved out to work with refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Then I moved out to become one of the refugee officers and our job was
                    essentially to track civilian populations, especially populations that were in
                    areas where they might get caught in crossfire or caught in bombing and all that
                    and to move them to safer areas. So essentially what we would do is fly out with
                    helicopters and depopulate areas by removing the civilians populations, all of
                    which was important because these civilians were, another way of looking at them
                    is that they were the dependents of the military, the Hmong military that were
                    fighting. It's very hard to have someone fighting in an area if their family
                    itself was in danger. So while at the time I didn't look at it that way, as you
                    look back on it a lot of what we were doing is moving military dependents,
                    moving villages where there were large numbers of military dependents, to safer
                    areas. Once we moved them, building schools and clinics and training doctors,
                    not doctors actually, but medics and nurses and school teachers. Providing them
                    with agricultural tools and helping them to get started again.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was it hard to get the people to move?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, it was usually easy to get them to move. The longer you stayed the
                    harder it was, because generally what happened is you wanted to keep them in
                    areas, in highland areas. They're highland people. So you would move them and in
                    a year or so the North Vietnamese would have moved that much further south and
                    hit their camps again or hit the area again. Once you'd moved them a couple of
                    times then it became more difficult, not to get them to move but to get them to
                    do everything they needed to do to reestablish their life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a period of increasing Pathet Lao taking over
                        territory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, mainly in northeast Laos it was mainly the North Vietnamese regular
                    army rather than Pathet Lao, but, yeah, this was an area where they were
                    continually moving south, putting pressure on the government, in this area
                    (pointing) right along the Ho Chi Minh trail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in military action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Only on the margins. There were times when I was out sleeping in a village
                    and there were firefights and I had to walk out of the village and get on a
                    trail to save myself. But for the most part, no. For the most part, we had
                    pretty good intelligence about where people were, where the North Vietnamese
                    were, where the Pathet Lao were and other than getting shot at as we flew back
                    and forth to work we were pretty much protected. Other than the guy that I
                    talked about that was killed, Don Shustrom, who worked in an area that was a
                    hotly contested area. So he was in constant, every time he went to the area
                    where he was working, he knew there would be firefights.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Laotian Government involved in these movements
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, the Laotian government was hardly involved at all. Almost of all of
                    this happened with the local government. Usually we worked with the local level
                    leaders of the village heads, the niban and the next level up, the tasangs and
                    all of them in this Hmong area were Hmong. There were a few lowland Lao villages
                    in that area, but not many. There were more kind of midlevel, because everything
                    was geographic there, you had the lowland Lao and you had the Hmong at the top
                    of the hills. You also had other ethnic minorities called the Lao Tung or the
                    highland Lao. Those people we worked with. There were smatterings of them and
                    they were also working with General Vang Pao and part of the minority army that
                    was up there but they were a very small part of it. But, yeah, there were very
                    few lowland Lao that we were working with, other than at very high levels.
                    Souvanna Phouma clearly dealt with Vang Pao and that level but at the local
                    level where we were working it was Hmong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought it would have been a bit
                        disheartening to the Hmong to continually have to move. I assume it's all
                        giving up territory, rather a feeling that we're on the wrong side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It's certainly disheartening in the sense that they were under continual
                    pressure and they were continually moving the wrong way and they were never
                    capturing territory and moving back. So, yeah, the longer that we were there,
                    the more discouraging it got for everyone, including the refugee workers and the
                    refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any attempt to bring in some fancier
                        military power, either new equipment or other, professional soldiers, or
                        anything of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There was really not a need for that because the Hmong were tremendous
                    fighters and it's kind of, I was watching boxing last night on TV and the guy
                    was saying in the corner, “You just have to let your hands go. You can beat this
                    guy if you let your hands go.” That was the way the Hmong felt: if we could only
                    get air support from the U.S., we could do anything we want. But as long as
                    we're instructed to hold defensive positions on the top of hills and not ever
                    move forward, not ever be on the offense, we can't do anything. When they did
                    conduct and operation, usually on their own, they were successful. But there
                    were several key things that they were doing. Among other things, there was
                    protection of TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) that was used to guide our bombers
                    to the Ho Chi Minh trail. So we had sophisticated equipment in a few places that
                    needed to be protected.</p>
                <p>So their roles were several. One was to hold defensive positions to keep the
                    North Vietnamese from moving south. The other was to protect a few key areas.
                    And there was no plan ever to be offensive or to take back area or to
                    reestablish a Hmong area that was secure. That was not in our game plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what was the reason for this, this game
                        plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think the essential reason was as someone called Cambodia, Laos was a
                    sideshow. The action was Vietnam. So what we were doing in Laos was essentially
                    a holding action to, one, bomb the Ho Chi Minh trail and try to contain the
                    North Vietnamese and try to not let them move through Laos to the Thai border.
                    So it was more of us having a policy that did not look at what the needs of the
                    Lao were as much as what our needs were to fight this war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across any of these troops Thai who were
                        turned into Laotians for a short period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WHITE: There were some Thai, they were called PARU, I don't know what that stands
                    for anymore [Ed: Thai Police Aerial Resupply Units, essentially special forces
                    units]. There were some of those Thai troops there but they weren't fighters.
                    They were essentially there as reporters, watching the action and informing the
                    Thai what was going on. They weren't Thai fighting units out there. All the
                    fighting units were Hmong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE; Oh, for quite a while. I was in Sam Thong from 1966 to 1969 or 1970. Then
                    I became a direct hire and in order to become a direct hire I became an
                    international development intern. So I had to come back to Washington for some
                    training and then I went to Korea for my internship in fall 1971. So I was there
                    in Korea for a year and a half or so and I was in training for a year or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In Korea I was an intern, so I rotated around all of the AID offices in
                    the embassy but essentially I worked in the development loan shop of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find Korea? You'd already had a glimpse of Japan
                        and now you experienced Korea. How did it compare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Fantastic. The first thing I found was that, very different from the
                    Japanese, the Koreans were very open and they were very American-like. When you
                    met a Korean you knew up front whether he liked you, didn't like you, very
                    straightforward. Korean and Japanese language are similar. Grammatically they're
                    exactly the same. So learning Korean was not difficult if you had Japanese as a
                    base. And I loved Korea. I was there at a time when we were winding down our
                    program. Korea was starting to graduate from our program. We were closing out
                    the mission there. So there was a lot of kind of freedom to do evaluative kind
                    of assignments and rather than developing new projects and all of that it was
                    more looking at what we had done and where it all might go. So the short period
                    I was in Korea I loved it. Great mission director, Michael Adler is one of the
                    AID greats and Philip Habib [served from October 1971 to August 1974] was the
                    ambassador there, also a really good guy. It was an exciting time. It was the
                    time in Korea when the North Koreans for the first time were coming down to
                    Seoul and there was a program called the New Village Movements that was designed
                    to beautify Korea, to put chicken and pig pens in every back yard and new roofs
                    on the houses and a countrywide program to make sure that the corridor the North
                    Koreans would come down was beautified first. That was an interesting
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>AID was working in really high tech ways. I had not been involved in normal AID
                    work before. And there I found university contractors like the University of
                    Michigan designing computerized agricultural models for Korea. We created
                    something called the Korea Educational Development Institute, which was a big
                    think tank for education. Just really exciting things. We created KIST, the
                    Korean Institute of Science and Technology. At the start of it there were like
                    two or three PhDs and we sent a bunch of people off to the States for PhD
                    training and now there are four or five hundred PhDs at KIST. So it's gone from
                    being a little tiny AID project of almost nothing to a really major
                    institution.</p>
                <p>So it was a good time to be there but I did yearn to get back to Southeast Asia.
                    So when I left Korea I returned to Laos, this time to work in Vientiane, in the
                    capital city. I stayed there for a year or so, maybe not quite a year and I saw
                    a cable from Cambodia. They desperately needed someone in Cambodia. So I went
                    from Laos to Cambodia, studied Cambodian for a few months and then went
                    Cambodia. So I was in Cambodia 1974 until the spring of 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you doing back in Vientiane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I worked in the front office for rural development as a deputy director
                    for rural development and that was a difficult job. After you've been out in the
                    field, working in really exciting work, for me it was hard to sit behind a desk
                    and really not do very much, other than tell other people what to do. And so I
                    was there in the capital city, doing a desk job for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been away for a little while. Was there a change in
                        attitude about how the war was going and what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was...when I was in Vientiane I had a countrywide view, rather than
                    just the Military Region II view of northeastern Laos and clearly things were
                    continuing to disintegrate everywhere. So it was more, I think, that things were
                    just going, just going in a difficult way and again our policy constrained us
                    from doing anything about it. So the most you could do is sit and watch things
                    deteriorate without having a good solution. Now what we didn't know about was
                    the negotiations that were going on, the peace negotiations. That was something
                    that, on the ground, I wasn't familiar with at all but was going on at the same
                    time. So things were happening that we didn't know about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, having been in the field, did you
                        find it difficult sort of living in Vientiane at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WHITE: I did and that's essentially why I moved as quickly as I could to
                    Cambodia. I didn't particularly like living in the capital city and commuting to
                    work and sitting behind a desk with everything that needed to be done there in
                    Laos. There's an interesting period there, as I mentioned, when the IVSers were
                    withdrawn and everything. My closest friend was Fred Branfman, who was an IVSer
                    in Laos who very quickly decided that we were on the wrong side of the issue and
                    that the North Vietnamese and the communists were on the right side of the issue
                    and he became a black pajama person who essentially believed in the North
                    Vietnamese cause. We were really good friends and he was constantly after me
                    because I was working up country in this kind of military operation and we had
                    tremendous arguments. When Fred left Laos, he came back to head up the antiwar
                    movement back here in the States. He was one of the leading people because he
                    had actually been out there and had lived it. I think he probably accompanied
                    Jane Fonda to Hanoi when she went. We were very good friends and we could drink
                    a lot of lao lao together and argue a lot but we really went two different
                    ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the stereotype of corrupt, discredited
                        government versus the modern uncorrupt communists who could come in with a
                        clean broom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I think that certainly that is the kind of thing you heard a lot and
                    there was corruption at all levels in the Lao government. But again I'm not sure
                    how much the people thought about things like that. That's the kind of things
                    that the politicians said or the media people said. It's not the kind of thing
                    that you felt and heard when you were out in villages. I think probably more
                    than anything else for me when I started in Sam Thong, when I started out going
                    out and working in villages, is I learned that there was a political side to all
                    of this. I had not ever looked at it or thought of it that way.</p>
                <p>I had been teaching in a school, I had been working with villagers on various
                    projects but when I started going out and sleeping in the villages, there's
                    nothing to do there but sit around a fire and talk to the village headman and to
                    the other elder people in the village. And one day I was in a Lao Tung, a
                    highland Lao village and the guy said to me, “It's interesting that when the
                    North Vietnamese are here talking to us or the Pathet Lao, they talk about what
                    a bright shining future there's going to be when we get rid of the French and
                    the Americans and all of these people, talking about the future. When you're
                    here with us, you're asking us about our customs and our traditions and how we
                    used to live. You're looking back this way and they're looking that way.” And I
                    never thought of that before.</p>
                <p>So in the airplane going back to Sam Thong I did a lot of thinking and I realized
                    I wasn't just there to teach English or to build a school or whatever. That was
                    like a light that came on. I had never been a political person, never thought
                    about these things before and in that one conversation I learned a lot about the
                    world and grew up, so to speak.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it sounds like in Laos that you might have had
                        corruption and all but the whole system was so decentralized and lack of
                        organization didn't make a lot of difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, it was so decentralized, so village based. For instance when I went
                    from village to village people would come up to me and hand me some local decree
                    from the government to say, “Can you read that?” I was the only person that
                    could read. So I would read it and it would say, “We've decided that five weeks
                    ago the school's going to have vacation for two days because of the king's
                    birthday.” Of course no one had been able to read it so they hadn't been able to
                    do anything about it, so then they would take that vacation anyway. But, yeah,
                    there was no sense with the people that I worked with that there was a larger
                    country called Laos with a king and all of that. Laos was a country of
                    communities, still. It wasn't a nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also I take it that there really wasn't the resources,
                        infrastructure, to rob it blind by the leaders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Only at the capital city level, where foreign aid is coming in and
                    military aid is coming in. We were supplying everything that could be corrupted
                    and it was happening in a very small circle of people. But once you left that
                    there was none of that. What we were doing is flying in and dropping rice on a
                    village. Everyone knows everyone and the rice would get divided up in whatever
                    ways it needed to get divided. In a small community, how much corruption can
                    there be? The only corruption that could happen out there is the North
                    Vietnamese or Pathet Lao would say, “We need thirty per cent of the rice. If we
                    get it, we won't hit your village.” And so unbeknownst to us there was rice
                    siphoning off to people that we didn't want to have it. But it was not the kind
                    of corruption that we talk about in Mexico, where it affects every person in the
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Cambodia from when to when, now? When you went
                        out there in 1974, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The situation was already getting pretty grim in Cambodia. There were a
                    few cities that belonged to the Cambodian government. Most of the countryside
                    did not belong to them at night for sure and even in the day the major road
                    arteries were still mostly open when we got there but very quickly those were
                    shut off. So within the first six months I was there they essentially had closed
                    off the roads, closed off the river and Phnom Penh had essentially become an
                    isolated city that had to be supported by air, a Berlin airlift kind of
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Cambodians vis-a-vis the
                        Laotians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WHITE: Cambodians were not nearly as friendly as the Laotian. The cultures are
                    very similar, but you had a more difficult situation. They were more developed,
                    more educated and so you weren't dealing with simple country people, you were
                    dealing with people that understood more about what was going on around them. I
                    liked the Cambodians but they were a little more difficult than the Lao. They
                    were also very aware, from the time that I got there, that the Khmer Rouge were
                    real butchers. This idea that no one knew that the Khmer Rouge was going to come
                    in and commit the atrocities that they did is just not true. Whenever the Khmer
                    Rouge came into a village they would cut off the head of the village headman and
                    they were just really brutal. The Cambodians often would say, “They look like
                    Cambodians, they speak Cambodian but they grew up in Vietnam controlled areas of
                    our country and so they have Vietnamese hearts.” So the popular sense was “We
                    need to do whatever we can to prevent the Khmer Rouge from taking control of the
                    country.” And I guess no one was really listening to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The same thing, I was working with refugees. We had a number of groups:
                    the International Committee for the Red Cross, World Vision, Catholic Relief,
                    CARE. Whenever there was a new group of refugees we would decided which
                    voluntary agency, which NGO, would work with them and we would give them the
                    wherewithal to set up soup kitchens, build houses and all of that kind of stuff.
                    We were based in the embassy in Phnom Penh, which was different because in Laos
                    we were not in the embassy, we had a separate compound. So that was my first
                    direct exposure to being in an embassy environment, rather than an AID
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find the embassy environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Good. I found, I guess the kind of things that you heard often, that State
                    Department people didn't speak the language and those kinds of things, certainly
                    was not true in Cambodia. There were three or four really good Cambodian
                    language officers in the embassy. I found that everyone was doing their maximum
                    to try to seek a solution in Cambodia. The picture that you often got was that
                    embassy people were there in their pinstriped suits writing their cables back to
                    Washington, not contacting the local people and living in a false environment
                    with the diplomatic community. That certainly wasn't the impression I got. I had
                    heard this in Laos as well. I found people that were really hard working and
                    really understanding of the Cambodian culture. The ambassador was John Dean [who
                    served from April 1974 to April 1975]. John Gunther Dean, was an
                    interesting...what I suspect, as I look back on it, is that he was probably
                    looking far more for a negotiated settlement and trying to find ways to work
                    towards a negotiated settlement, than perhaps he had authority to do. As I look
                    on it now, those kind of negotiations happen at a different level and a
                    different place than in an embassy. His stance from the beginning was more
                    finding a way to make things work and negotiating</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Khmer Rouge still was impossible to deal with,
                        essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's absolutely right. There's no way to deal with them. I was there
                    when, February or March 1975, when a big congressional delegation came out. The
                    concern of everyone was that funding was being cut off, at the very point where
                    we had essentially tried to Vietnamize the Vietnamese Army and to work with the
                    Cambodians to get them to take a larger role in everything, they depended on our
                    support, at that point we were going to cut off the support as well. So it was
                    Bella Abzug and Millicent Fenwick and all of these people came out to take a
                    look at what was going on. I think they probably were not very helpful when they
                    went back and you could almost see the beginning of the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, in a way, this resettlement, I would
                        think as the Khmer Rouge encircled Phnom Penh, you begin to run out of room
                        to resettle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes. I think, in Cambodia we weren't doing much resettlement. We were
                    essentially moving people, we weren't moving people at all, people moved
                    themselves. So essentially what we were doing there is just making sure that
                    there were temporary shelters and medical care and soup kitchens. In some of the
                    outlying provinces, like Battambang province, there were still refugees that had
                    to be moved and resettled, but they were small numbers. The big problem was how
                    to handle Phnom Penh that was under siege and increasingly what happened is
                    everyone came into Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well after Congress cut support, was this signal to
                        everyone that this was the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Certainly for people working there this was kind of the final nail in the
                    coffin that things were going to end. We're talking about right at the end, now.
                    We're talking about February or March of 1975 and the Khmer Rouge came in in
                    April. So, yeah, I think people, probably that the embassy started an evacuation
                    plan fairly early on, maybe in March of moving, originally dependents were asked
                    to leave. There weren't a lot of dependents there, but there were some. And then
                    gradually people were moved out, so that in the end it was not the massive
                    evacuation that took place in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WHITE: I left just before the end. I was asked to go up to Battambang province
                    and find all the Operation Brotherhood Philippine doctors and nurses that were
                    working up there and get them to leave. The original idea was that after I did
                    that I would just go up to the Thai border and cross over with a couple of
                    Agency people who were also going to just close down their offices and cross
                    over. When I got to the border I found I couldn't cross over because I didn't
                    have any identification. When we went back and forth to Cambodia we did so on a
                    U.S. operated airlift run and didn't go through immigration on either side. So I
                    couldn't cross the border and eventually had to work my way back down to Phnom
                    Penh, which I did and then I left maybe a week before the evacuation. And my
                    assignment was to go and work in Utapao an air force bas in Thailand, where we
                    set up a reception center to receive Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodians as they left
                    to go wherever they were sent: some to the Philippines, some to France, a lot of
                    them to this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Thailand, doing this, from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was in Thailand from the spring of 1975 for a few months. That was not a
                    permanent assignment for me. That was while I was waiting my on-going, next
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your evaluation of how we were handling the
                        people coming out of Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was, there were a lot of people coming out and a lot of different
                    levels of people. For instance, in Vietnam a lot of the Vietnamese Air Force
                    people were flying out jets and landing them at Utapao, which gave the Thai
                    heartburn, I'm sure. So those people were handled very differently than the
                    people that were coming out that were essentially villagers. A lot of the people
                    that came out were official, in one sense, in that they were somehow connected
                    directly to the Americans, either government officials that worked closely with
                    us or people that worked in our houses or other friends. So for those people,
                    the processing was as good as it could be. It's difficult because what you were
                    doing was sending some people off to foreign shores and other people were being
                    assigned to refugee camps on the border and that was too much for me, to have
                    worked in that area for ten years and seen people give so much to our country,
                    the idea that we're going to send some people off to refugee camps along the
                    border for a future undetermined, I requested to be assigned to Africa or to
                    Latin America. I didn't want to get stuck there on the Thai-Lao border, having
                    worked with refugees for ten years and speaking Thai, Lao and Cambodian. My
                    future could have been working right there with people who had given their lives
                    that we were, I felt, mistreating by not letting them into our country. So I
                    left. That's when I moved to Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Panama? You were in Panama from 1976 to
                        1979. What were you doing in Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's a good question. First regular AID assignment. I was in the office
                    of education, health, nutrition, not being sure why I was there, what I was
                    doing, having worked for AID for almost ten years but not knowing any of the
                    language, not knowing the documentation process. When we were in Southeast Asia
                    we were working in a CORDS-like program that was broad U.S. government based, it
                    was not a traditional AID program. So there I was in Panama, in a normal AID
                    office, dealing with project papers and all kinds of stuff that I never heard of
                    before. But fortunately the thing that saved me as my boss had also been my boss
                    in Laos. We had worked as a chief and deputy for a year or so in Laos and there
                    we were together again and very close friends. He had had a more normal AID
                    career. So he became my mentor and allowed me to survive that shock, real
                    culture shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I'm told that because oft our worldwide reach, AID
                        could assign people anywhere in the world. I've talked to people who were
                        African hands who were saying, “These guys who had been in Saigon or some
                        place where they had three or four servants and everything else and all of a
                        sudden they're in the middle of an African village. They didn't like it,
                        they didn't like the Africans, they're no longer the little pashas that
                        they'd been before.” Was that part of your culture shock?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Of course I didn't fit that mold because I had always worked out in the
                    village situation with no running water, no electricity and all of that. So I
                    quickly parlayed the Panama experience into something more like Southeast Asia
                    and the way I did that is my mother is American Indian. One of the things I
                    didn't mention, when I was in Korea my father died and I'm an only child. So we
                    took my mother to live with us in Korea and then when I was assigned to
                    Cambodia, well, she went to Laos with us but when I was assigned to Cambodia, my
                    mother and my wife stayed in Bangkok, because I was actually, there was a rule
                    there that John Gunther Dean could only have 200 Americans in country at
                    nightfall. So there's a big shuttle. I was actually assigned to Thailand and did
                    a permanent TDY in Cambodia. So my family lived in Thailand and there was a
                    count everyday and if we were over 200, I got on a plane and went back to
                    Bangkok. So at any rate then my mother went with us to Panama and she's American
                    Indian and General Torrijos was having real issues with the three Indian tribes
                    in Panama, the Chok�, the Kuna and the Guyami, trying to figure out how the
                    government should deal with them. He asked the AID director, Tragen, if Tragen
                    could assign someone to help him work with the Indian groups and figure out what
                    they wanted and that kind of thing and I was assigned to do that. So that put me
                    back out in the jungles, walking to Guyami villages or Chok� villages or sailing
                    around the Kuna islands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to come back to this but you mentioned that you got
                        married. Talk about your wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WHITE: I spent some time in Luang Prabang, Laos, the royal capital and at that
                    time, for the first time I was living in an environment where I had a house. I'd
                    never had a house before. I'd gone to college and ate in cafeterias and all
                    this. All of a sudden I had this government provided house. I was still working
                    with refugees but I found it difficult figuring out how to live in a house and
                    what to do. One day I went out to a refugee village, attended a meeting of
                    people, and I thought I understood everything that was going on. On the
                    helicopter on the way back I was talking to this woman next to me who was
                    working as a health worker with refugees and telling her what I understood from
                    this meeting. She explained what was really going on, and who was related to
                    who, and all of this. We became good friends and eventually got married to each
                    other. She's Laotian Thai. So that was a big change in my life. I was a
                    confirmed bachelor and all of a sudden I went down just like that and she's
                    still my wife, after all of these years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when you were in Panama, what was the state of the
                        Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The Indians, there were three tribes. The Guyami were up towards the Costa
                    Rica border and they were very well organized, in the sense that they had things
                    to be organized against, like the copper mines. There were things that were
                    going on that helped them organize to be against something as a people. So they
                    were fairly organized. And then there were the Kuna, who are probably the most
                    organized people in the world. The Kuna lived in this series of islands. If you
                    left your island to work on the mainland or to work on a boat or whatever,
                    you're given a quota of money that you had to send back to support your island.
                    So it's a really tight social system and the Kuna did very well. And then there
                    were the Chok�, who lived down on the Colombian border in the Darien. They were
                    totally disorganized.</p>
                <p>So it depended on who you were dealing with. When you tried to get the three
                    groups together to figure out what an Indian policy should be, you had three
                    really different situations to deal with, which made it difficult as they were
                    trying to decide, should we have reservations, or comarcas as they called them,
                    or how should we help Indians integrate into our society or should we leave them
                    alone. There were three different positions on everything.</p>
                <p>So, again, my job was partly to get to know the situation there and to help the
                    Indian tribes define what they wanted, both in terms of development but in the
                    larger sense, the political sense of where they might want to go as an Indian
                    nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself acting more as an advocate of the
                        Indians vis-�-vis the Torrijos government? Was that what AID was doing or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, I guess what I found was, I did find myself in some conflict but it
                    was not with the Panamanian government. I guess what I found was the General
                    Torrijos was very open and sympathetic to the Indians and they really liked him
                    and felt that he as a leader was trying to do the right thing for them, even if
                    the bureaucracy was not, if it was moving too slowly or for whatever the reason
                    wasn't getting them what they wanted it was not Torrijos' fault. Like many
                    charismatic leaders he had an ability to separate himself from the workings of
                    the government.</p>
                <p>Where I got into a little bit of a problem was that I was often invited by
                    Torrijos to go with him when he went out to the Indian areas to give speeches
                    and all of that and that put me into some conflict with the embassy, who felt
                    that there's no reason for this AID person down here from the bowels of AID to
                    be out with someone like Torrijos. And I also worked with General Torrijos'
                    sister, who worked in preschool education, we were doing preschool education
                    projects. So I had some connections there that were sometimes not comfortable to
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>AID's essential role in this, other than just kind of eyes and ears and figuring
                    out what the Indians wanted was to do development, to do economic development in
                    Indian communities. So I was doing things like helping the Kuna Indians buy
                    generators from excess property so they could set up their own electrical
                    systems in their islands. I actually started a really interesting project. AID
                    had for a long time talked about participation and how important it is that
                    people participate in the development of projects. I did a project that was
                    called the Guyami Development Project that essentially put all of the project
                    development in the hands of the Guyami Indians themselves and their meetings,
                    rather than in the hands of AID, to take something that AID had talked a lot
                    about but had never really done and tried to make it happen. So that gave me a
                    lot to do and fights in the bureaucracy on how you let local people really
                    participate in development and still meet all of AID's requirements for what you
                    do when you develop a project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find relations between the Indians and
                        the Panamanian, I assume basically the Panamanian bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Pretty bad. The common Latino phrase was Indios y gatos animales ingratos,
                    “Indians and cats are ungrateful animals.” So the bureaucracy felt no matter
                    what you did for the Indians they still hated you. But they didn't do very much
                    and maybe that's the reason. So, yeah, there was no good feeling at all between
                    the Indians and the bureaucracy. Fortunately, the kinds of things that we were
                    doing we were doing directly with the Indians, rather than as AID normally does,
                    working through the Ministry of Agriculture to help install some project, we
                    were doing projects directly with communities. So we didn't get involved in that
                    interface but it was a bad interface between the bureaucracy and Indians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run across that unique tribe the
                        Zonians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WHITE: A lot. I dealt a lot with the Zonians, not in my official capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Americans who lived in the Panama Canal
                        Zone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Right. No, my contact with them was not official but in Panama I had a
                    motor home and I mentioned this before, my mother is American Indian and she
                    loved to fish. So every Friday after work we'd get in the motor home and we'd
                    drive out to the Canal Zone to Gamboa, which was right in the middle of the
                    canal, halfway between Panama City and Balboa and we would park on the banks of
                    the Chagres River and my mother could fish Friday evening, all day Saturday and
                    all day Sunday and Monday we'd go back to work. So while I was out there in the
                    Zone every weekend I met lots of Zonians, the good kind and the bad kind.</p>
                <p>The good kind were...a lot of people had a lot of friends in the Zone, including
                    the Canal Zone police and others. But there were certainly a number of Zonians
                    who hated Panama, hated everything around them except the Zone and would let you
                    know that. But in general I think that what they did was they developed a lot of
                    good infrastructure in the Canal Zone that eventually during the Canal
                    negotiations became one of the things that Panamanians looked forward to, not
                    only just taking over the Canal but Canal Zone College and a lot of
                    infrastructure there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it relations between Americans and the Panamanians
                        were fairly good because ten years later they began to get nasty under
                        Noriega.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I think Panamanians in general felt that the Americans were
                    oppressive, that we were occupying their country. So wherever I went, when
                    people first saw me they thought I might be Cuban until I opened my mouth and
                    said three words of Spanish. Until they heard my Spanish they were really
                    friendly and then when they knew I was an American and not a Cuban they were not
                    nearly as friendly. I think relations...other than the people that depended on
                    the Americans, if you ran hotels or restaurants or tourism facilities or worked
                    with Americans you were friendly. But you would never guess from the rest of the
                    Panamanians that at one point we were considering adding Panama as a state,
                    because they were really not happy with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Panama Canal as overwhelming an issue as one
                        assumes it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think that was the big issue. The big issue was not only the
                    Canal. It was Ancon Hill. Ancon Hill was in the Canal Zone and it was a place
                    where all of the antennas were sticking up in the air and people would say,
                    “That's where the CIA works and that's where they're manipulating our country
                    and our leaders and buying off people.” And it was this hill with all these
                    antennas, so that became the magnet. So that became the issue, rather than the
                    Canal itself, although the big issue was the Canal. Of course at that time, when
                    we got there, I was there in '76, we were already moving towards negotiations on
                    the Canal and at that point Carter actually came down and so we were moving in
                    the right direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I stayed there until mid-1979. Somoza was overthrown in July 1979, Carter
                    wanted to work out a relationship with the Sandinistas, to show that, Nicaragua,
                    to show that we could be friends with the Sandinistas and that government. So I
                    was asked to go, right at the early stages of the Sandinista period, to
                    negotiate a food aid program with the Sandinista government, as a part of our
                    attempt to show that we were willing to work with them. So I was there in
                    Nicaragua for three months or so, working on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the situation and your reception in
                        Nicaragua in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was maybe the most difficult thing that I've ever done. We would sit
                    around this huge table, maybe forty or fifty people sitting around a table and
                    the honorable representative of the republic of, say, Albania would say, “In six
                    months we're going to provide three cans of sardines for the revolution” and
                    everyone would say “Viva la Revolucion!” And they would get around to me and I
                    would say how many DC-6's or C-123's of rice we had loaded that day, absolute
                    silence, as if we weren't doing anything. I was clearly the person who shouldn't
                    be at that table, even though we were the only ones that were doing anything. So
                    that was difficult. More difficult was the Sandinistas wanted us to turn all of
                    our food aid over to their government to be distributed by, they were forming
                    block groups, so that every block in the city had an organization so that they
                    could report on each other and all of that. They said those are the people who
                    know where the poverty is, so that's how the food should be distributed. And we
                    were arguing that it should be done by the International Committee for the Red
                    Cross or someone like that. So these just ongoing battles and the pressure was
                    tremendous for us to work with the Sandinistas but not to give in to their
                    system and to try to pull them to the international system. I had not, in all of
                    these dealings that I've talked about so far, I had not been in this arena of
                    dealing with a government and negotiating with a government. So that was
                    difficult for me and fortunately it was short, only three months.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I had already been accepted for long term training at Stanford University and I
                    looked like if I got a fulltime assignment to Nicaragua that my long term
                    training would go out the window. So I fought pretty hard to do what I could do
                    in Nicaragua and then get to Stanford University as soon as I could and I didn't
                    get there at the beginning of the school year. I got there probably at the end
                    of September 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time, what was your impression of Nicaragua and
                        the Sandinista rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, my impression came mainly from those difficult negotiations. They
                    were not interested in anything that we had except for our food and our money.
                    They were not willing to compromise one iota on anything. They had essentially
                    come to power through the help of Cuba and revolutionaries around the world and
                    they were going to be a sore in our side for a long time. That was my view going
                    in and that was my view going out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a sort of feeling of cynicism
                        on the part of others like yourself, who were involved in this food program,
                        sort of what the hell are we doing with these people? Why not let them stew
                        in their own juice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Probably there was some of that, although there was some of the other, as
                    well. As I recall, there was another AID person who had been involved in the
                    seminary with one of these Sandinistas and had the opposite view, that all we
                    need to do was work with them for a while and they'll eventually come around and
                    find a compromise position that we can accommodate. But I think probably the
                    people that I worked with most closely had the same impression that I had, that
                    it was going to be a hard row to hoe, so to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you're off to Stanford? What were you
                        studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, I went to Stanford from 1980 to 1981. I took a course in
                    Communication and Social Change in the Third World. There was supposedly a very
                    famous professor, Shramm but when I got there I found that he was leaving that
                    year so he wasn't professor. But it was a good course. I was in a course with
                    people primarily from the Third World and a few Europeans. There were maybe 16
                    of us in the course and it was about how you use communications technology to
                    bring about social and economic development in the Third World. So it was right
                    along the lines of what I'd been doing. What I found interesting was that there
                    was such a strong left bias to professors at Stanford. I remember taking a
                    couple of education course because that's what I was doing was education and
                    this guy, Martin Carnoy was his name, he had to be a card-carrying communist. He
                    was just really awful. Even in the communications program that I was in the
                    professors approached everything from a radical point of view. I was surprised
                    at how left-leaning the university was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Stanford housed the Hoover Institute, which was a
                        right wing</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Right under the shadow of the Hoover Institute were all of the guys who
                    were very far off to the left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a political-social phenomenon, you were probably the
                        beneficiary, with the professors, of so many radical students ended up
                        getting their PhDs to duck the Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I had not thought of that that way. That's an interesting comment. That's
                    true but at least there was good debate. I remember getting in a lot of
                    arguments, especially when professors would start talking about the Vietnam War
                    itself or what we were doing there, I could put my hand up and say, “I was there
                    and that's not the way it was.” No one ever shut me down. So at least there was
                    that. I appreciated the fact that I could do that. The interesting thing about
                    that period at Stanford was that Alejandro Toledo was there and we became
                    friends. He later became the president of Peru. In fact, when I left Stanford, I
                    went to Peru as my next assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul, in 1981 you were off to Peru. What was your
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In Peru I was the deputy chief of an office that dealt with health,
                    education, nutrition and primarily I worked in education. I had a preschool
                    education project in Cuzco and Puno. I had a technical education project in
                    several places, Chiclayo, Trujillo and I worked a bit also in the nutrition
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1981, what was the political situation in Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was...the Sendero Luminoso was just starting to really get moving. When
                    I went out to Cuzco and Puno to work in the schools, I would go into the schools
                    and on the blackboard was stuff the Sendero had been doing the night before with
                    the community. The teachers would always run up and erase everything off the
                    board. So they were starting to form out in the hinterlands and they were
                    tossing a grenade over the ambassador's wall in Lima and blowing up power lines
                    and doing small things like that to get attention. When we got there it was
                    right at the, the military government had ended and it was the beginning of the
                    Bela�nde democracy (May 1980) and a terrible time. The military had devastated
                    Peru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had the military done that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well I think they had just through bad practices they had essentially shut
                    down the economy. So things were really bad. When we first got there there was a
                    prohibition, you couldn't buy meat in the market, for instance, 15 days a month.
                    You could only buy fish or chicken and the chicken had been fed on fishmeal, so
                    everything you bought tasted like fish. It was just, the economy was really run
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the health, education department. How did the
                        bureaucrats respond? Did they talk to you about how the government had
                        been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Not a lot. There's a new crew in, eager to do things better, rather than
                    looking back at the past. And we did something in AID that was rather unique for
                    AID, and that is, we negotiated our agreements with the state governments and
                    regional entities rather than with Lima. So we didn't get tied up in the
                    bureaucracy in Lima. So in the preschool education project there were direct
                    agreements with the state governments of Cuzco and Puno. We had an educational
                    planning project that was also out in that area and they were all decentralized
                    projects and not many times that AID has tried that. It was quite successful
                    because you get down to the level where people want to make a difference and
                    they can see what they're doing, as opposed to the people in the capital
                    city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the government's approach to education.
                        Was it highly centralized, every teacher was on the same page at the same
                        hour, was it of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Somewhat like that and the whole idea of decentralized planning was to
                    move away from the kind of state controlled planning where the set the same
                    curriculum for the Indian areas in Cuzco and Puno that they set for the Latino
                    areas. The whole idea was to try to bring about some variation in the curriculum
                    to reflect local needs. And it was reasonably successful but that's always a
                    hard thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first time in that sort of area. How did you
                        find the Indian population? Had they been overlooked or was there a cultural
                        attitude towards education? What did you find?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WHITE: It was hard with the Indian population. You looked at Machu Picchu and you
                    looked at the canals and all of the tremendous public works that had been done
                    at some point in the past and then you look at these people who were out there
                    who look like they couldn't build an outhouse and you wondered what happened.
                    And there was never an answer for that. But, yeah, what you found is a people
                    who had been marginalized, who were not that interested in education. They
                    didn't have education as a burning theme, let our kids get an education so they
                    could get ahead. They were living off the land, just barely surviving and with
                    not a lot of ambition to have things change. So change was being forced from the
                    top down rather than the bottom up, which doesn't work very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you trying, you, was our program but specifically
                        you, trying to break this ... attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE:. I think the idea behind the decentralized educational planning was if you
                    could make the education relevant for the area that you were teaching in, you
                    could people more interested. So you're not teaching about the Moors in Spain
                    but you're teaching about how to do better agriculture in the Cuzco valley, then
                    not only the kids but the parents would see a benefit in that. So that was the
                    broad scheme, to make education more relevant, therefore getting people to show
                    more interest. But the problem is that's a long road and when you're dealing
                    with AID projects that were three to five years in those days, it's hard to show
                    results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're fairly new to AID at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I was not new to AID. I'd been with AID for quite a while. But I had
                    been in Southeast Asia, not doing this kind of AID work. I'd been working with
                    refugees and more political stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the AID with Latin American
                        characteristics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, interesting, because when you looked at AID in those days, the Latin
                    American bureau was touted as being the best of all the bureaus in terms of
                    designing projects, in terms of speaking Spanish and understanding local customs
                    and fitting the programs to the needs. So I can talk at several levels. At the
                    mission level, out in Peru, I found a group of people who did speak the
                    language, most of whom had Latina wives so they knew the language and the
                    culture and were very dedicated. As you moved up the ladder and you got to
                    Washington, you also found in the Latin America bureau people who had come out
                    of the field and therefore understood it well. So I think that set Latin America
                    apart from Asia or Africa, where you had lots of different languages, lots of
                    different cultures and the kind of bureaucracy in Washington was formed from
                    people and not really understanding the area. So Latin America had a natural
                    advantage. So that was good. You really did feel that you were working in the
                    elite bureau in AID and that what we were doing tended to make a difference.</p>
                <p>The problem was always the kind of social unrest and upheaval in many of the
                    countries and you would move ahead and then get set back again for various
                    reasons. In Peru it was not quite so bad as a place like Bolivia. But even in
                    Peru you would move forward a couple of steps and then you would have either the
                    Sendero or you had some reason why everything just kind of stopped for six
                    months. You couldn't get in the area for work or other reasons. It's my sense
                    that development happens when you have a long period that you can work with and
                    when you have stops and starts things don't happen, because people forget very
                    fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find Peru had sort of the traditional
                        difference between the Indian population and the Spanish descent population?
                        Was that pretty apparent or had changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That hadn't changed at all. I worked with the Indian populations in Panama
                    first and then my second place was Peru and then Guatemala, so I had a lot of
                    activity working with the Indian populations and the Latino population in all
                    those countries are the same: Indios y gatos, animales ingratos; “Indians and
                    cats are ungrateful animals.” And that was kind of the Latino attitude towards
                    the Indians. And the Indian attitude towards the Latinos was that they were out
                    to get whatever they could get. They were the tricksters and they might look
                    like they were trying to work with you but there was always an ulterior motive,
                    trying to get something of yours. Which is the exact same attitude that people
                    in Latin America had towards the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did they feel towards you, you and the people in
                        AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Probably the same way. If you're dealing with your direct counterparts in
                    ministries, people were a bit more sophisticated, perhaps had been educated in
                    the West and maybe had a more open attitude. But as you got down to people in
                    the campo, in the field, there was always this sense of maybe mistrust. There's
                    always a sense that there's something else behind whatever you were doing,
                    rather than just the goodness of your heart.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, the educational programs, kids going to school.
                        Did they quite early and did they pay much attention to their work
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The problem was not so much the kids as the teachers. The teachers weren't
                    very well prepared. So one of the things we were doing was working with
                    teachers, trying to train them to work better. But as a result of that, having
                    poor teachers, poor facilities and also having all of the pressure of an
                    agricultural society and the work cycle, kids tended to drop out very early.
                    Usually what happened is that girls dropped out first, after the second grade or
                    so, third grade. By the fourth grade the boys were dropping out to work in the
                    farm in rural areas. And also there are not very many schools out there, so once
                    you got to the third grade or so then you're talking about going to a nearby
                    town and spending all week in a boarding facility of some kind, which was pretty
                    miserable. So everything was against the most rural populations in terms of
                    getting a good education. So when you had someone that came out of that area and
                    they were able to get a good education, they had really fought for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to that, were there opportunities for Indians who
                        were achievers to move into or did things sort of stop them from going
                        anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There were very few opportunities, certainly before the mid-Eighties.
                    Where there were opportunities it was usually in a small religious school,
                    either in a Catholic school or even Protestant schools, but, yeah, in the public
                    system there was little opportunity. I think we will talk about this again when
                    we get to my assignment in Washington where we were trying to make up
                    opportunities for social and economically disadvantaged people. But even in
                    those days in AID, while we were trying to work with the poorest of the poor our
                    programs weren't designed to do that. So our scholarship programs were similar
                    to the USIA (U.S. Information Agency) programs, the Fulbright Programs, for the
                    elite, sending people off for masters and PhDs, rather than working with people
                    at lower stages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the teachers were the key. Did you get very
                        far with the teachers? Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, there were some teachers who'd come out of the rural areas but for
                    the most part they were urban teachers who were assigned a one or two or three
                    year stint somewhere out in a rural village, even though they came from Lima. So
                    that was difficult for the teachers and difficult for the students as well. We
                    certainly worked hard with teacher training, but that's a tough area and
                    teachers are unionized everywhere and they're stubborn and resistant to change
                    and they want to teach exactly what they learned. And the idea, for instance, of
                    decentralized educational planning and going and working with a local team to
                    develop a curriculum responsive to the needs of an area was pretty alien to most
                    of the teachers. They were comfortable looking at their notes and teaching what
                    they had been taught. So none of that is easy. And what you do in a situation
                    like that is you try and find a few champions that you work with who really
                    believe in what you're doing and hope that at some point they will overcome all
                    of the resistance around them.</p>
                <p>But what you can't do as an aid program, whether it's from the United States or
                    any government, is you can't provide the wherewithal for those people to
                    overcome. It's something that really has to be inside them somewhere. So you can
                    facilitate, but you can't make it happen. You have to depend on others, so
                    that's one of the frustrations, even when you have a team of really good people,
                    who understand this all and are willing to make it happen. My direct counterpart
                    was the Director General for pre-school education in Cuzco. That was a very good
                    person who fully understood what we were trying to do and had the Ministry of
                    Education in Lima, to the extent that she had influence, backing what we were
                    doing. We had people in other places, like in the Ministry of Planning, there
                    were people that understood what we were doing. Again, the problem was that they
                    were a minority of people here and there, even though some had power, you could
                    never get enough people aligned to really make large changes happen.</p>
                <p>I guess that's where I've, I've long been a proponent of AID and State, all of
                    the U.S. government agencies, working closer together than they have at times,
                    because when you have the voice of the ambassador and the AID director and you
                    have everybody pushing the same direction with the same interest you can get a
                    lot more done than when you're out trying to do that on your own. I felt that
                    over many of my assignments the embassy's got a certain set of things that they
                    do and that occupies the ambassador's attention, the AID mission is doing
                    another set of things and the military another set. What you have is, it hasn't
                    come together very well in many places. The country team concept was, I don't
                    know when it happened but that's a good concept and that helped a lot but in
                    those early days that wasn't the case.</p>
                <p>Frank Ortiz was the ambassador to Peru when I was there [Ed: served from November
                    1981 to October 1983] and I don't recall him being involved in AID affairs but
                    again I was kind of down in the bowels of AID at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get out in the villages much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WHITE: Quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe a village, what it was like when you'd
                        get out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: If I went by myself it was one thing. If I went with the mission director
                    or some other people it was more of a doggy show and tell. But when I went by
                    myself usually what I would do is, I would be with some local officials from
                    Cuzco, Puno or wherever and they would make contact and people knew that we were
                    coming. We would go in, meet the village headman and usually have a discussion
                    with him first about why we were there, what we wanted to do and he would
                    usually accompany us to the school or to the health clinic. If you overnighted
                    then there was a chance to spend time with the folk, go into houses and talk to
                    people. If you were not spending the night then usually you got escorted around
                    by the village headman and only saw a few people. So I tried to spend nights
                    when I could, to get a better feel for what was going on. When that happened,
                    people were pretty open to having you come in and sit down and talk to them or
                    have an evening meal with them, sitting on a dirt floor around a fire, I'm not
                    talking about anything really fancy out in the rural areas and speaking pretty
                    frankly about things, including the Sendero and what was going on
                    politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Sendero Luminoso, how was it seen in these
                        villages? What I gather, this was a bunch of Peruvian intellectuals coming
                        out of extreme, almost like the Khmer Rouge type. How was this fitting in
                        these villages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think people were trying to understand what was happening and this was
                    almost a throwback to something I probably mentioned earlier, when I was in
                    Laos, out in villages talking to people and at one point one of the villagers
                    said, “Why are you so interested in our culture and our language and things like
                    that? When the communists are here they're talking about what a bright future
                    we're going to have when we overthrow the French and the Americans and all these
                    foreigners.” It was the same there. What the Sendero was doing was out in every
                    village having community classes at night, bringing everyone in and, as I said,
                    using the blackboard to try to explain a new theory of government that was more
                    of the people and encouraging them to rise up and overthrow the authorities
                    because then there would be a better life at the end of that. So, yeah, it was
                    very much something that again was not rising from the bottom up but, just like
                    the AID program, people coming in with a theory of how you could have a better
                    life and working with nothing to offer except their words. At least when we were
                    going in we had agricultural tools and seeds and school books and we were
                    offering a lot more, but we weren't dialoging with people. They were sitting
                    down and dialoging with people. Big difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>My sense is that there was a small group of people who were able to demonstrate
                    that they could disrupt power lines and roads and cause a lot of trouble. I
                    guess I didn't get the sense, although it would be hard for me to find this out,
                    that they had convinced people intellectually or philosophically on anything.
                    But they certainly were able to convince people that they could cause trouble if
                    they wanted to cause trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the problems often has been these left wing
                        movements come out of the universities and are heavily, sort of extreme
                        Marxist, left wing students out of the university usually aren't brothers to
                        the Indians. I would think that this was not a good fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think that certainly has been a problem with those movements. It's
                    very hard to go into those Indian villages, they're like the Thai, they will
                    bend with the wind and they will sit and listen but it's pretty hard to convince
                    them of things if you're not one of them. I remember once I was in an Indian
                    village with an AID assignment to find out about women and development and what
                    we could do for the women in that village. And you're sitting there with an
                    Indian headman, the cacique and all of the elder men of the tribe are sitting
                    around inside the big house and all of the women are outside, listening in the
                    windows and you're talking about women in development to all these men. Finally
                    at some point a woman yelled in the window, “If you really wanna find out what
                    our life is like here, just come and live here for several years and you'll
                    understand it.” But just the scene of all these men sitting there and us talking
                    about women and development is kind of the way things are, because if you're an
                    outsider coming in, you're always an outsider, on both sides, from the left or
                    from the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Catholic Church, or the Protestant Church?
                        Did they play any particular role in Peru at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I didn't get a sense of the Protestant Church, but I did with the Catholic
                    Church, because in technical education we worked with a group called Fay
                    Alegr�a, which is one of the Catholic technical, vocational skills training
                    groups. My sense was that the Church was in a lot of places trying to do
                    vocational, technical education and practical things. They were strapped by not
                    having a lot of wherewithal to do it and also by the traditional Church, which
                    was out there saving souls and doing whatever Churches do, rather than do
                    education and nutrition. That was kind of a secondary interest of many in the
                    Church. So these guys that were trying to do more on the practical side I
                    thought were fighting an uphill battle within their own Church and also
                    struggling to find the wherewithal to do more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you, in education or in any programs,
                        were going head to head with the church or were you on the same side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think in Peru probably I didn't see that as much as I did earlier when I
                    was in Panama. When I was in Panama we were, we decided in all of our wisdom to
                    develop a Central America book program. The schoolbooks were atrocious
                    everywhere, everybody spoke Spanish so why not work out of Mexico and develop
                    primary school books for the whole region? And there we came into direct clash
                    not only with the teachers but with the church. The church was also very
                    satisfied with the traditional education system. Those were battles that you
                    couldn't win, so even though AID produced teams with representatives of all of
                    the countries, so all of the kind of things that were important got built into
                    the books, those books never saw the light of day. They sat in warehouses 'til
                    they rotted away, in all of the countries. That was essentially the teachers and
                    the church aligned against any innovation there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the military play a role in Peru? Some militaries
                        spend an awful lot of time putting their people out and doing rural
                        development of one kind or another. How about the Peruvian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The Peruvian military was working in areas that I didn't work in. So they
                    were out in some places doing, building roads and doing those kinds of things as
                    exercises, probably largely in areas such as Pichis or Palcazu, which is the
                    area where a lot of drugs are produced. So you wonder, in the end, if they were
                    doing it for community development or for other reasons. But they were working
                    in those drug areas. They were also working in the Amazon area, where there's a
                    lot of gold and everything and they were doing those kinds of exercises. That
                    was at a time when I think AID was very suspicious of those kinds of programs.
                    There's always been a dialogue within AID about whether we should align
                    ourselves or use the military when we're trying to build farm to market roads in
                    difficult areas, whether we should form an alliance with either our own military
                    or domestic military. And AID has been generally against that, although I noted
                    in recent years that has changed. But even in those days there was that dialogue
                    and we stayed rather far apart from the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the teachers' union sort of a nut you couldn't
                        crack?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think it was a nut that we didn't try very hard to crack because
                    we knew we couldn't. They're just too large, too powerful. Yeah, so we really
                    didn't try. We were doing innovative things. We were trying to introduce
                    automation. Not computers, in those days. I'm trying to think of what the term
                    was. For instance, we were trying to introduce microfiche into the system as a
                    way to automate a bit. Some of those things the teachers' union had no problems
                    with. We were also, in Peru, setting up a satellite system to introduce master
                    teachers, so that a master teacher in Lima, Peru could get on the satellite and
                    talk to teachers in Tarapoto in the jungle and either help teach classes or to
                    teach the teachers. Again, we didn't encounter any resistance on that kind of
                    innovation. But when you get down to the really basic teacher training
                    curriculum development, that's where there's a pretty difficult line to follow
                    and if you stray off of it you knew it right away. So, yeah, we were trying to
                    work in teacher training and curriculum development and usually it didn't rise
                    to a point of us having a confrontation because our counterparts that we're
                    working with would, if we were trying to push something that wouldn't fly, the
                    battle would be between us and our counterparts. It was really hard because AID
                    has a reputation for bringing in outside experts and developing something and
                    putting it on the table for people to follow. That's generally not how we work.
                    Generally we work with local counterparts. Even if we bring in a technical
                    expert they have a local counterpart. And that's where we were kept in line and
                    they'd just say, “You can't do that. There's no use struggling with it.” And for
                    the most part we didn't do the things that seemed to be too difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Indian teachers, many?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Not many. Most of them were from metropolitan Peru and they're doing a two
                    or three year station out in the Indian area before they got a good
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this done with good will or not particularly good
                        will?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think it was done with good intentions but it was just really difficult.
                    So you would find teachers that got out and after a few weeks they just couldn't
                    take any more so they would go back to Lima on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and
                    Tuesday they would start back to their school and they'd get there on Wednesday
                    and teach Wednesday and Thursday and then leave and go back to Lima. So you got
                    partial teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the universities? Were they doing anything about
                        trying to reach out to the Indian population?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WHITE: They may have. In those days the universities were all extremely leftist
                    and Americans could barely walk on campus. So other than a couple of small
                    private or Catholic universities that we could work with, that was it. We
                    couldn't work with the large public university. My sense was and this is just a
                    guess, that they were very ideological. They had a lot of things to say but they
                    weren't doing much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view what you were doing in the time you were
                        there? What would you point to as a success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I guess I viewed it differently then than I view it now. When I was there
                    I guess I thought that we were really making inroads, that the kind of things we
                    were doing were all going to stick because the counterparts were enthusiastic
                    and when you went out you'd see teachers using what you were trying to promote.
                    But as you look back on it in hindsight, as long as the program money was
                    flowing then everybody was staying in line doing things. The real acid test was
                    when the money stops flowing does the program stop and in many cases it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given this exposure did you want to stay in Latin America
                        after your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's a good question. I was an Asia hand, a born and bred Asia hand. I
                    found Panama interesting because I was working with the Indians and I found Peru
                    also interesting, although not nearly as interesting as Panama, because the
                    Indian culture was much, much further away. In order to get to Puno and Cuzco I
                    had to take a plane and spend several nights away from my family at a difficult
                    time. So by the end of the assignment in Peru I was ready to say I'd done Latin
                    America. For that reason I took my first Washington assignment. I'd never had a
                    Washington assignment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Lima was tough. My mother was living with us also, so we had my wife and
                    my mother. They were alone a lot because I traveled quite a bit. All of my
                    projects were out in the hinterland. So I would probably be at home for a week
                    or ten days and then be gone for a week. Neither my wife nor my mother spoke any
                    Spanish, although they both learned market Spanish while they were in Latin
                    America. We're not a very social family. They didn't go to embassy parties and
                    things like that. So they felt very isolated. They were isolated enough in Peru
                    that they did become, join the Women's Diplomatic Society and they became candy
                    stripers and they'd done a few things just because I wasn't around. In general I
                    think my wife was not overly comfortable in Latin America. Latin America's very
                    different from Southeast Asia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Certainly when we went out to rural areas, when I took my wife with me, it
                    felt like rural areas do anywhere. She felt kind of at home in the rural areas.
                    What she didn't like was Latin society. She didn't like the kinds of artificial
                    throwing arms around people and kissing them on the cheeks, the closeness that
                    people stood when they talked. There are a lot of small things in Latin society
                    that didn't fit well with her. She was happy, though, when we went out to rural
                    areas. She always felt, especially the Indian areas, she felt that was almost
                    like going home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1983 you are off to a Washington assignment. What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was in Washington from 1983 to 1986 and was the head of education and
                    training, energy and the environment for Latin America within AID. That was an
                    interesting move for me. I'd never dealt with energy and environment before but
                    they were all packaged in that office. So that gave me an opportunity to work in
                    fields that I had not worked in before. But somewhere along that time came the
                    famous Kissinger Commission for Central America [Ed: The Commission was
                    announced in July 1983 and submitted its report in January 1984].</p>
                <p>What they did is they formed this commission and went to Central America to try
                    to figure out what was going wrong and why Central America was going so far to
                    the left. That impacted me tremendously, because one of the things that they
                    did, John Silver from I think it's Boston University was on the Kissinger
                    Commission for education and what they found is what I call an X curve. They
                    found that training from the Soviet Union to Central Americans had gone from a
                    few hundred a year up to almost ten thousand a year and training from the U.S.
                    to Central America had gone from seven or eight thousand down to one or two
                    thousand. So when you graph that it looked like an X, with Soviets increasingly
                    working with the universities and providing training and specifically providing
                    training for high school kids and for undergraduates where we of course were
                    providing training for graduates. So the Kissinger Commission on education
                    recommended that the U.S. do a new training program that would look at serving
                    socially and economically disadvantaged people and Indians and I was asked to
                    develop that program. So that became my major activity in the mid-Eighties,
                    developing something called the Central American Peace Scholarships Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the Kissinger project, you said you had
                        energy. What is this, how would energy and education and health fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, they didn't necessarily fit. What they had was like a technical
                    office that dealt with the technical sectors. So there was education and
                    training and then on the other side of that I had some people in my office that
                    were either energy officers or environmental officers. So I had a kind of
                    bifurcated office, with two sets of technical people in my office.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the energy people knew what they were doing
                        and just went about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, the energy people, especially the environment people, really knew
                    what they wanted to do and they didn't necessarily want any supervision. So I
                    was good at being able to do some of the bureaucratic things to defend their
                    program, their budget and all of that, but they certainly didn't want me playing
                    around very much with their technical stuff. Environment at that point was not
                    huge. People were just starting to get involved in the environment, so even
                    though there was talk about environment there was not a big program.</p>
                <p>Energy, however, was a different story because the guy at the NSC, the admiral
                    who was at the NSC {Ed: Rear Admiral John M. Poindexter?] had an idea that there
                    was lots of thermal energy in Central America, with all these volcanoes and
                    everything and he was bound and determined that AID should go in and develop
                    thermal projects everywhere. The most that AID had been doing in energy was
                    working with portable generators and cooperative electricity and things like
                    that. So there was this kind of struggle between the NSC and AID over what we
                    should be doing that occupied a lot of the political debate in the energy side.
                    Other than that there was a little bit of experimentation with wind farms and
                    things but it was all nothing big, so that the energy and environment side was
                    an area that I got involved in on the margins, on the bureaucratic side and
                    occasionally on the political side in arguments, but the technicians are like
                    all technicians, they don't want you to fiddle with what they really are
                    interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well on the educational side, did you find that the sort
                        of the educational apparatus in Washington really understood the situation
                        down in Central America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, what I saw in the Kissinger Commission report was a tremendous
                    opportunity to secure funding to do the kind of programs that I thought would
                    make a difference there but I found almost immediately was that all of the
                    education officers in the region rejected the idea of working with the socially
                    and economically disadvantaged because AID has a mentality that you train people
                    when they're already in a job, you train them to do their job better. You don't
                    recruit people out of high school or undergraduates who've never been in the
                    work market, marketplace and train them to come back and possibly do something.
                    That's USIA's role. AID's role is to take people that are already working and
                    help them do it better. So I found immediately, even though I could get millions
                    and millions of dollars to do this training program that there was resistance.
                    So after my first round of travel to Central America talking to people, I found
                    that my allies were the ambassadors, not the AID mission directors, or the AID
                    education people. So after that, when I traveled I would first go and talk to
                    the ambassador and then go talk to the AID mission, because I knew I would get a
                    friendly ear in the ambassador's office and that he would also use the idea of
                    this programming in country team and elsewhere to bring about change. So it was
                    hard, it was really hard to get this program going. We were going to train ten
                    thousand people over five years at U.S. universities and almost all of them
                    undergraduates, something AID had not done before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your eye sort of fixed on what the Soviets had done
                        and this was something you had encountered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, my eye was fixed on that as the argument that got the money and the
                    program going but my sense was that we were not going in there trying to counter
                    the Soviets on a one to one basis, that we were going to use that money to do
                    what we thought needed to be done and part of that entailed training
                    undergraduates and reaching high school students. So there was a running battle
                    with the Congress, more than anyone else. There were staffers in the Congress
                    who...staffers are funny. They're like me, they were opportunists. So they say
                    in this opportunity to set aside money to Georgetown University to compete with
                    AID as to who could do a better job in implementing the Kissinger Commission
                    report. So one day I read in the Washington Post that there's going to be this
                    huge set-aside to Georgetown University out of my budget to do a similar program
                    and then after a couple of years implementation the Congress would compare how
                    Georgetown did with how AID did to make decisions about further funding. So
                    there was a lot of politics involved in this, not only between the AID missions
                    and getting them to do a politically inspired program instead of a technically
                    inspired one but at the federal level between AID and the Congress.</p>
                <p>So all of that was tremendously interesting for me. It's something I had not, I
                    had always been out in the field, dealing with Indians and all of that. I hadn't
                    been dealing with the bureaucracy and the politicians and...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the urban myths about AID over the years is that
                        essentially it's a welfare program for the middle class American
                        technicians. In other words, an awful lot of the money goes to Americans.
                        The University of Michigan sends people out to Ethiopia to do law studies
                        and this is great support for the University of Michigan. Were you seeing
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Certainly. There's two sides to every argument. Sometimes you go out and
                    you make the argument that out of every dollar that AID spends, seventy or
                    eighty per cent of it comes back to the U.S. to buy farm products or to
                    technical people at universities and all of that. So that's one way to argue, to
                    defend the program as well as a way to argue against the program if you don't
                    like that. I fall into the category of saying the more money that we can spend
                    in a country directly with the country, the better we are and the more that we
                    rely on local technical capacity and local universities and build their
                    capacity, that's what we should be doing rather than strengthening the U.S.
                    universities or the U.S. NGO's or whoever. So there's a great camp there of
                    people, the people who are out wanting to show results would like to bring in
                    the Michigan states and the others and design a program that develops a computer
                    simulation model for agriculture in Kenya and they can do all of that without
                    even talking to a local if they want to and they can eventually show that
                    they've done this product. If that's development that's fine and are were
                    certainly lots of people who, that was their job. I wasn't one. I came from, the
                    people that were in AID that came up through the Peace Corps, through other
                    local kind of programs like that, formed a different kind of element that wanted
                    to see development results in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time in AID, who was winning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: During my time in AID, I would say that it's a tossup. The thing about AID
                    that probably more than any other characteristic paints AID, is that it's
                    tremendously decentralized. So every AID mission had its own character and its
                    own nature and its own programming and that made it impossible for people in
                    Washington to ever go to the Hill and describe what AID does, because every
                    program's different. I spent seven years with the Japanese aid program later in
                    my career and the Japanese aid program was a cookie cutter. No matter where you
                    go in the world the program is the same, which makes it really easy to describe
                    and to characterize and to put numbers on but it makes it very sterile. The
                    thing about the AID program is that it's extremely rich and one place you go the
                    guy in charge is the guy who wants to see local development happen and he's
                    channeling all of his money to local NGO's and to local universities and local
                    technical assistance. And you go right next door to the next country and they
                    have Michigan State contracts. So it's kind of hard, six of one, half dozen of
                    the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had people say, you get an AID director who comes out
                        of the cattle breeding business or something and develops a very significant
                        cattle breeding thing in say Uganda or something like that. He leaves, the
                        cattle die and somebody else is in forestation or something like that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WHITE: That's exactly what I was saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, there isn't much continuity in this, which
                        means an awful lot of projects that just don't have a long life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In the, probably in the late Seventies and through the Eighties, AID
                    developed a CDSS, a Country Development Strategy Statement. So every country
                    that AID was working in had to have this base document that talked about what
                    the country's needs were, usually based on rather elaborate, very expensive
                    sector assessments in all the different sectors and out of all of that work
                    which gave wonderful amounts of money to contractors and universities, you had
                    this document that, the Bible, that said here's what the U.S. government's
                    strategy should be for development in X country. And these theoretically were
                    reviewed and approved with the embassy and the State Department and all of that.
                    Now, the problem was that in fact AID, when you're a technical person the one
                    thing you learn very early on is that if you load things up with so much
                    technical stuff the politicians aren't going to read it. So the CDSS was a
                    series of technical documents that no one would wade through, and so State
                    didn't do due diligence. The CDSS was a wonderful opportunity that was probably
                    designed so that there could be more order put into the foreign aid program but
                    it didn't happen because AID people made it a very technical exercise that State
                    didn't participate very much in. But that would have been part of the solution
                    to what you're saying. That would have put some order and focus and
                    concentration into every country program.</p>
                <p>Now we've gone through lots of iterations of that. As I was leaving a few years
                    ago they had come up now with the embassy plan, the embassy comes up with the
                    development strategy for a country. It's a country statement that comes out of
                    the country team where all of the elements of the country team contribute. The
                    problem with that is that the sections on development...when this happened I was
                    in Mexico as the AID director and it's the Drug Enforcement Agency and the
                    people that are dealing with counterterrorism and all of these people that form
                    the key element of a country strategy and development's considered, because we
                    had a small program, fifty or sixty million dollars, not very much of anything
                    contributing to this. So you're just an add-on, rather than looking at it as how
                    can we use that sixty million dollars to best realize our other objectives. So
                    it's still, even though it's more in State's hands than it is in AID's hands to
                    develop that kind of a strategy document, it's still not bringing AID into the
                    fold.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Of course that has been a major argument for a long time. How do you get AID more
                    under the umbrella? (Senator) Jesse Helms, had he had his way, we would just
                    have become a part of State. I was, on the AID side, saying that's probably more
                    a good thing than a bad thing, but people that were close to it and most AID
                    people were, felt that that would have you doing all kind of very short term
                    objectives and forgetting about long term development, which is what many people
                    feel we should do. We shouldn't be worried about putting out the fires, we
                    should be worried about planting the forests that are going to grow ten or 15
                    years from now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The trouble is administrations change. I think it was the
                        Carter Administration was more short term and concerned about famine in the
                        Sahel and trying to fix things quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, every administration has its own character as well. One of the
                    things that I found is, in looking at administrations and how AID changes, is
                    that in general the Republican administrations have been more on the side of
                    foundations for long term development and Democratic administrations have been
                    more on the side on putting fires out and Republican administrations have by far
                    and away provided the bulk of the funding. Every time there's a big funding
                    increase for foreign aid, you'd think it would come from the Democrats but it
                    hasn't. It's come from Republican administrations. Now there might have been
                    Democratic Congresses. I haven't tried to figure out how it happened. But it's
                    usually when Republicans, the Reagan period was one, huge jump in our foreign
                    aid. Another is right now, with the Bush Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID was amalgamated into the ARA group wasn't it, at that
                        time, or not, or was this just in name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Just in name. I think there was certainly, at some point AID was brought
                    more into the umbrella at the highest level and all that meant was that the AID
                    administrator both was his own man but he also went to the Secretary's meetings.
                    But it didn't have any impact further down the agency, or very little impact.
                    And that has been true all the way until very recently when the embassy has
                    started doing its comprehensive country plan now. But, again, as I said AID is
                    just a tail on that and so AID continues to do what it wants because State still
                    is not, in my opinion, doing its due diligence and maybe being more demanding.
                    Not in Washington, but out in the field. Out in the field is where you can do
                    it, if you have an ambassador interested in AID. For instance, when I was in
                    Guatemala, which was my next assignment, the ambassador there was so interested
                    in AID that he could talk about what we were doing better than either I as the
                    deputy director or the director could and in fact liked AID so much that he left
                    State and came over to AID, Jim Michael and went out to the OECD's DAC
                    (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance
                    Committee) in Paris as an AID guru. But that's highly unusual, where an
                    ambassador has taken a tremendous interest in what AID is doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this working? In their time the Soviets were
                        taking large numbers of people. Were we able to bring a significant number
                        of Central Americans to the United States for training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We brought over 15,000 Central Americans to the States in several
                    programs. One was a junior college program that brought them for a couple of
                    years. One was a four-year university program, or five years if you added
                    English on. We also finally convinced the Congress and this was a huge battle on
                    my part, that if we really wanted to start reaching the socially and
                    economically disadvantaged, we couldn't bring them all for university training.
                    We had to bring people on short term training as well. So we started bringing
                    tremendous numbers of highland Indians from Guatemala for two-month courses or
                    three-month courses. We introduced several things that were new into the
                    program. One was something called Experience America, that when you bring people
                    for training it's fine to bring them and have them sit in their dorm for their
                    entire time, studying and going to class, but the idea of getting them out to a
                    Thanksgiving parade or to a football game or to someone's house for dinner or
                    whatever should be, if you don't program that in as something that's important
                    it happens in a few cases but in most cases it doesn't happen and so we made
                    that part of the programming, Experience America.</p>
                <p>Another thing that we did is to say that once you're trained the job's not over.
                    The job's over when the trained person returns home and is actually using that
                    training in some productive way in his or her country, that therefore you should
                    provide resources in the country once people have come back to continue to work
                    with them until they're being productive. So those were big changes in the way
                    that we did, that AID did its training and it was only for Central America, it
                    wasn't AID-wide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Central America at this time was, the war was on, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>WHITE: El Salvador, the war was really hot and Nicaragua, the Sandinistas had
                    taken control and it was difficult to work there. But there were some things
                    that really turned around our relationship with, say, the leftist universities.
                    For many years AID had had a program called RTAC, Regional Technical Assistance,
                    what it did was it produced American textbooks in Spanish for Latin American
                    universities and it was a very successful program that had gone on for ten or 15
                    years, in the Sixties and Seventies. AID doesn't like programs that don't have
                    an end point and so at some point even though this was a tremendously successful
                    program AID just said, “It's been going on 12 years or 15 years, we have to stop
                    it.” So when I came into this program I said, “If we really wanna impact on
                    Latin American universities, we can bring all the people we want for training,
                    but if we wanna do something more short term with those universities let's
                    reintroduce the RTAC program.” So it was a bureaucratic struggle to get AID to
                    agree to reinstate the program but we did. We started working with McGraw Hill
                    producing textbooks in Spanish. We opened bookstores in the public universities
                    throughout Central America and those books were for sale there at cost. And all
                    of a sudden we were able to go back onto the campuses whereas before literally
                    we couldn't. I remember at the University of Panama the ambassador for some
                    reason had to go to the university and as soon as he got in and got out to his
                    meeting the students turned his car over and set it on fire. That was kind of
                    the way all of those public universities were. By the end of the Eighties we
                    were back in the universities. The bookstores were a tremendous success. The
                    recruiting for long-term training, one of the places we focused on was the
                    universities. All of that opened doors. This is the good part. It was not only
                    that AID was doing that through the CAPS program, the Central American Peace
                    Scholarships program, USIA developed a companion program called CAMPUS and the
                    two programs worked together. In fact, in many countries when a person applied
                    to a program the application came both to AID and to USIA. We had a committee to
                    meet to decide which program it fit better into and in some countries, like
                    Costa Rica, all of the program documentation was the same. So, just tremendous
                    cooperation between the two agencies, which had not happened in the past. So all
                    of that started to change the way that the U.S. was able to deal with education
                    in Central America.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Washington in 1986. What were you trying to
                        do? Get back to Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, when I worked in Laos, I worked with a guy, Tony (Anthony J.)
                    Cauterucci, he was my boss and I was his deputy. When I went to Panama in the
                    Seventies Tony was also the head of the office I worked in, I was his deputy. So
                    Tony in 1986 went to Guatemala as the mission director and he asked me if I'd
                    come and work with him again. So we'd worked together in the Sixties and
                    Seventies, so here's the chance in the Eighties. We were very good friends. I
                    decided, okay, I'll give Latin America another shot.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WHITE: Very tense. I think it was like the wild, wild West. The military was out
                    of control. There was a lot of tension between the Indians and the government.
                    It was just a dangerous place. People carried weapons. It was not a fun place to
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Ambassador Alberto Piedra [Ed: served from August 1984 to August 1987] was
                    an interesting guy. He was a member of Opus Dei. He wasn't very happy with our
                    family planning program there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Opus Dei being a Catholic, very disciplined Catholic order
                        of laymen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: ...laymen, and he was very supportive of AID, Ambassador Piedra was but he
                    was nothing like Ambassador Michel, who followed him, who knew our program so
                    well and was so supportive. During that period was also, the peace negotiations
                    were starting in Guatemala. I was not involved in that at all but the big
                    political scene was that there were discussions there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was negotiating with whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well that's a good question. Trying to get the combatants to lay down
                    their arms and convincing them that they would not be imprisoned if they
                    peacefully tried to put Guatemala back together again. A number of things were
                    happening. Obviously the military, the Guatemalan military were heavily involved
                    in that, as were the United Nations, involved as well. So that was kind of a
                    backdrop for what was going on there.</p>
                <p>The AID program itself was working in the highlands with Indians. We'd done a
                    number of things that had not pleased the government. For instance, AID had a
                    bilingual education program with the Indians and that was extremely
                    controversial. Bilingual education was always controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say bilingual, is this Indian language
                        and...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WHITE: ...and Spanish. The idea was that the dropout rates and retention rates
                    were so high that if you offered the first grade entirely in Mayan language,
                    second grade half in Mayan and half in Spanish and by the third grade have them
                    integrated into Spanish, the theory was if you did it that way you would be able
                    to retain people longer in the system. And it's probably true, that result was
                    probably achieved but it was extremely controversial, even among Indian
                    villages. You would have villagers who would say, “I don't want my kid to go to
                    school to speak in Indian language. I want him to go to school to learn
                    Spanish.” The argument is that if you start in Mayan and move into Spanish you
                    perform better over the long run but that wasn't very obvious to some villagers.
                    So within villages and within the government this was extremely controversial
                    and was one of those things where AID in a sense forced the hand, as we
                    developed the project and found a few people who were willing to work with us to
                    implement it, implementing it even though it was surrounded with controversy.
                    Usually we don't get involved in those kinds of programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul, what was your portfolio? What were you dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In Guatemala I was the deputy director, so I was almost entirely dealing
                    with internal AID bureaucratics and working with the bureaucratic structure of
                    the various project officers in the mission, making sure that they had good
                    projects designed, making sure that we could argue with Washington for budget
                    for those projects and dealing with personnel matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, did you find inappropriate or not
                        well run programming? What did you find when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. Certainly I found some project
                    managers who I felt were not on top of their projects the way they should be,
                    but for the most part that wasn't the case. I found some projects that did not
                    fit the new spirit of AID, of working with the private sector and a lot of the
                    things that we had changed over the years. A lot of the projects were more,
                    especially in the agriculture sector, were more traditional projects that AID
                    had moved away from in most of the world. So part of my job was to update the
                    portfolio and get rid of the kind of agricultural extension projects and things
                    that AID didn't do anymore and move the money into more private sector oriented
                    activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, in Guatemala, were we spending a significant
                        amount of money actually on the country as opposed to bringing in
                        experts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, we certainly were spending money in the country. We also brought in
                    experts. While I've generally said I don't like that, one of the things that we
                    did was, we brought in a team of experts to look at a forty year retrospective
                    study of what AID had done in assistance to the highlands of Guatemala, to go
                    through all of the past records and look at projects and try to figure out from
                    what we had done forty years ago up to the present, what had stuck and what had
                    not. Which institutions that we created continued to function as institutions
                    and in fact had grown and become Guatemalan institutions, which ones died the
                    year after our money stopped. So that was an extremely useful study and it was
                    done not entirely by expats, because there were some Guatemalans on the team. We
                    insisted on having a Guatemalan anthropologist and a couple of others. But it
                    was largely expat. But very useful in showing that projects that you think are
                    extremely successful because everyone's toed the line and they've done
                    everything they were supposed to do, two years after they're over noting
                    remains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been one of the great complaints about our aid
                        program. What was the assessment that you had? What kind of worked and what
                        didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, the other side of that story is that projects that really sputter
                    along and that have difficult times and the project officers on the local side
                    are really difficult to deal with often are the projects that are successful,
                    because those are the people that have an idea they're fighting for and they're
                    struggling for and they're willing to argue with you, instead of just toeing the
                    line and getting the money they're really working to make an idea work. And
                    they're dealing with other people and struggling to get money and dealing with
                    the kind of change that happens in management. So at the end of the project you
                    look at the AID evaluation, it looks like a series of fights and it hasn't gone
                    anywhere, many of those projects are the ones that have, that were successful.
                    So what I come out of that with is that it really depends on the leadership of a
                    project. Success depends on leaders and it depends on leaders who are willing to
                    take issue with AID, to stand up for their own principles. But we tend to like
                    the people that work with us well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of projects seem to develop roots in that
                        culture there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, the institutional development projects. When you're working within
                    an institution to strengthen that institution, as opposed to working directly
                    with farmers and you had a program that somehow was able to avoid the
                    agricultural extension system or the university extension system and go in and
                    set up demonstration projects directly with farmers and all of that, you might
                    have benefited those few farmers that you were working directly with, but over
                    the long run when the project's over there's no institution there to continue
                    doing it. So the ones that really struggled with the hard job of institutional
                    creation and strengthening were the ones that were more successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have like, farm agents, in other words, people who
                        are out there to give help to a broad variety</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: For instance, in Guatemala a lot of agricultural cooperatives were set up
                    in certain projects and the cooperatives, working with the agricultural
                    extension agents and the government is always difficult because that's usually a
                    very weak institution and usually there's huge turnover. So you go in and you
                    work with these guys and you train them, you send them off to the States and
                    they get a masters and they come back really ready go and they come back in the
                    same situation, a weak institution. The next day they're gone and they're
                    working for Ralston Purina or something. So a better way seems to have been to
                    work with local institutions, local cooperatives, where you're actually not
                    working with the farmers but creating a cooperative structure that is lower
                    level than a government agency, that's part of the community and that possibly
                    has a chance to stay on and sustain itself. So that was one of the things.
                    Another is working with the local NGOs (non government organization). Where
                    there's a local NGO who was there before our project and will be there after it
                    and you work with them to strengthen what they're doing. And that's another
                    secret, it seems, is to work within the structure of what someone else wants to
                    do rather than what the outside expert thinks should be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of NGOs were you finding, because this is a
                        fairly new phenomenon, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: NGOs are not that new. Working with them as a government agency is fairly
                    new. AID started working with NGOs in the late Sixties, early Seventies and
                    we've been working with local NGOs over all of that time. Some of them are
                    church-based. I mentioned Fay Alegria, with is a church-based, Catholic-based,
                    religious vocational education group. But we've also worked with lots of others,
                    lots of local NGOs. The problem that you have with local NGOs is a lot of them
                    tend to be humanitarian. They exist to give food to someone or provide other
                    kinds of help and AID generally doesn't like social welfare projects. We want to
                    work in technical areas. So part of our job has been to identify local agencies
                    who have all of the heart in the world and help them build the brains to go with
                    that heart. So, helping them to develop the management structures that will
                    ensure transition of leaders, helping them develop budgetary capacity, helping
                    them to develop the ability to write good proposals so they can get funding from
                    not just AID but from other donors. So we've tended to work with NGOs in those
                    kinds of structures, not necessarily just in a project mode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it most of your work was with the Indians in the
                        highlands. Well how did you find the central government, which I assume
                        would be more Latino, dealt with the Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WHITE: Again, we had the same problems that you have elsewhere, a lot of
                    prejudice. For instance, a good example is in the Central American Peace
                    Scholarships Project, which I developed in Washington and now I had a chance to
                    implement it in Guatemala. We would send Guatemalans off for training. As I
                    mentioned, we send a lot of Indians off for shorter-term training and some for
                    long term training as well. But I recall this one incident where the local
                    Latinos that we had sent to a place for training ended up staying in the hotel
                    where some of the Guatemalan Indians from Guatemala who were there on another
                    training program. The Latinos protested that they didn't want to stay at the
                    same hotel the Indians were staying at! So that's the extent to which sometimes
                    that feeling is still there. It's difficult. There was a person in the Ministry
                    of Planning that we worked with, the head of planning, in fact, who had a really
                    good sense for what we were doing and was very supportive. We worked with him to
                    try to ensure that there were line items put in the Guatemalan budget that would
                    support continued work with NGOs and with Indian groups and were able to have a
                    lot of influence because there's a lot of local currency.</p>
                <p>In the old days, AID did a lot of projects that generated local currency. For
                    instance, PL-480 commodities that were sold. Bring in wheat, you give the wheat
                    to the bakers, they make the bread, sell it and some of the money goes back to
                    the Ministry of Planning in a joint account that's jointly administered by USAID
                    and the ministry. So there was all of this local currency and AID was getting
                    out of the PL-480 business.</p>
                <p>So we were able to negotiate, for instance, that that local currency would be put
                    into specific line items in the Guatemalan budget that would support local NGOs,
                    support local Indian activities and all of that. Now, I haven't looked recently
                    to see if those line items have continued. But certainly over a period of time
                    those line items existed and that was because the Ministry of Planning was
                    strong enough and had the ear of the president and was able to make those kinds
                    of changes. So I consider that a real achievement. Was it a lasting achievement?
                    We have to look and see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reflection of, I know Guatemala has an
                        extensive border with Mexico and all. Did this make any difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In those days, the difference was that when the military was really
                    killing Indians, the Indians found they could escape across the border to Mexico
                    and escape the Guatemalan military, so it created a political problem along the
                    border. That was the extent that I knew about when I was in Guatemala. When we
                    get to my Mexico assignment I'll talk about some of the cross-border things
                    between Mexico and Guatemala that we tried to do there.</p>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think the sense was that they were subversive, that they were working to
                    if not overthrow the government to cause trouble like the Sendero, all the way
                    from local robberies to perhaps things that were more political in nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have problems going into the highlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, but we worked the part of the highlands that was closest to Guatemala
                    City. The further you got into the mountains, the more difficult it got. We had
                    a couple of projects with sheep and other things in more distant places but for
                    the most part we worked the area that was closest to the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant produce infrastructure in
                        Guatemala, supplying fruits and berries or whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, one of our projects then, it was just at a period when the U.S.
                    market was starting these niche market kind of opportunities for winter crops
                    from Latin America. So we had a number of projects that produced strawberries
                    for the U.S. market and produced cut flowers for the U.S. market, a whole series
                    of, asparagus. And those kind of things really boomed and we did it all through
                    a cooperative program, developing cooperatives that did this and we helped them
                    with quality control, with packaging and all of that, with contact with the
                    market in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about women? Were we trying to empower women or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We were, yes. Part of that Central American Peace Scholarships Project was
                    that there was the “Experience America” and that was to continue to work with
                    people after they returned home. Another element that was really different from
                    what AID had done in the past is that I set a target that fifty per cent, I
                    think actually it was forty per cent, of the trainees had to be women. And that
                    was at a period when I looked at AID's program world-wide and it's something
                    like 18 or 19 per cent of all of our trainees were women. We exceeded that. We
                    did 55 or so per cent of all the trainees in that 15,000 were women. So that was
                    a major step forward. People said, “You'll never be able to get highland Indian
                    men to let their women go the States for training.” So that was a challenge and
                    we went up to the area and recruited people and found that that was not a
                    problem at all. That was just an old wives tale. So we were able to send large
                    groups of women, sometimes ten or 15 or 20 at a time, for training in the States
                    but also in the undergraduate programs we recruited a lot of women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when, let's take women, came back from this shortish
                        training, what would they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, it's amazing the kinds of things that happen. We sent them up for
                    very specific kind of training. For example if we found of village of candle
                    makers and so we sent them up to learn how to do a better job of making candles
                    and some of the training was more specifically on leadership development, the
                    kind of thing that USIA used to do. But what we found was it was not necessarily
                    the training that was given that made a difference in lives but things that they
                    saw while they were in the States. So a lot of the Guatemalan women went to
                    Florida for training and one of the things they did, as a part of their training
                    they would have a chance to go to Disney World. They also had a chance to go to,
                    in Miami, to a Miami flea market. And we found later that all over the highlands
                    women had developed flea markets. One of the things that they learned from that
                    trip was that you could get things together and market them and people would buy
                    stuff that you'd never think they would buy. So all of a sudden there's this
                    little development of things that no one had, that was not part of what we were
                    looking at and I haven't seen any follow up studies recently. but I would really
                    be interested and I keep talking to people about going down and looking at the
                    people that we trained here all these years later to see what else they've done
                    that we might trace back to things that they saw in the U.S. or things that they
                    learned during in training, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Reagan Administration, still.
                        What about the family planning, birth control, which a Republican
                        Administration usually was not supportive, but how did that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I've seen those transitions several times and I guess I think the
                    stink is usually raised in the U.S., with people that have strong political
                    leanings. When you get out to the field, between the UN family planning program
                    and all of the other donors that offer family planning, if the U.S. was not
                    offering some specific activity like abortion there are twenty other ways that
                    that program continues without us and it's not a big deal. Even though it's a
                    big deal here.</p>

                        but this was the one radical state in Central America. Did that play out? I
                        mean, were there reflections in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WHITE: I don't know the answer to that. Certainly I didn't see anything there.
                    One of the things we did, the lady that worked with me on all of the training,
                    this happened largely after I left Guatemala was that the peace accords were
                    finally negotiated and the dissidents laid down their arms and we developed a
                    huge training program to reintroduce them into society, giving them new skills
                    and all of that. The lady that worked with me on all of my training ran that
                    program. She was really excited about the results, that the people she was
                    working with were both eager to be trained and that the programs were good and
                    people were going out and actually going into the marketplace with new skills. I
                    didn't look at that program but I communicated a lot with her when she was doing
                    it. But Nicaragua, I'm not sure that there was any impact there. I think people
                    looked at Nicaragua as, Somoza was overthrown, that showed that the left could
                    do some things but Nicaragua was a special case. It might have encouraged the
                    leftists but it maybe also gave some encouragement to governments to work harder
                    to try to not let that happen. That might have even pushed the peace process
                    faster in El Salvador and Guatemala.</p>

                <p>WHITE: No, it was a civilian government when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the military perform?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I didn't have any dealings with them. My sense was that the military was
                    largely autonomous and that they ran large areas of the country like up country
                    in the highlands. It was like a warlord situation, where the military was
                    running it, not the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the military warlords impact on your

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, only to the extent that earlier, that program of bilingual education,
                    I think the military really didn't like that program. That had shut down before
                    I got there but I had a sense that the military was heavily involved in shutting
                    that program down and in fact the guy that ran that program, the AID guy, went
                    to Pakistan after Guatemala and during my time in Guatemala he came back to
                    Guatemala on vacation and he had worked so closely with the Indians he went up
                    country to visit some of the people that he worked with, many of whom had
                    crossed over, become refugees in Mexico and he was killed up there. His body was
                    found floating in the ocean and we tried everything we could, we had every
                    agency in the U.S. government that we could, try to trace it, because everyone
                    felt that he was probably assassinated by the military because of his previous
                    involvement. We could never find any smoking gun there but we certainly lost a
                    good officer. Frank Fairchild was his name.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1989. Where'd you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I came back to Washington. I was offered a job as the director for Asia
                    and South Asia in AID, which was where my heart had been for a long time and so
                    I came back and took that job for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul, you're the Director in AID's Office of East Asian
                        and South Asian Affairs (ANE/ESA) in 1989. What were we doing in Asia,
                        AID-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, those were big issues. On the AID side we had the Pressler Amendment
                    implementation for Pakistan, which meant, the Pressler Amendment was, if a
                    country was developing a nuclear device we could not provide them with aid.
                    Pakistan was our largest traditional aid program. I think Egypt was larger in
                    dollar sums but Pakistan was second. So we had to shut down the program. What
                    that meant was looking at every project to determine the right end point for the
                    project. If you're building a bridge over a canyon you couldn't stop halfway
                    through the bridge so you had to go to the end, so every project</p>
                <p>We tried to end everything at a rational stop point but there was also time
                    pressure from the Congress to end things as soon as we could. So that was quite
                    an exercise. So that was one major activity.</p>
                <p>A second big activity were what I call the cross border programs. They were
                    programs that probably traditionally had been run by the CIA but they had been
                    turned over to AID to implement and that was support on the Thai-Cambodian
                    border to the anti-communist group, the three groups that were working, sort of
                    pro-democracy groups along the border, providing them with housing and shelter
                    and food and the wherewithal to continue to exist. And then there was support
                    for school teachers and medics and others within Afghanistan, working out of
                    Pakistan. So those were in my portfolio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about Pakistan first. What were you
                        hearing from your organization and from your Pakistani colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I think there was profound shock that we were cutting off a really
                    large AID program that was quite successful, when, in Pakistani eyes, right next
                    door India also had nuclear weapons and was not subject to the Pressler
                    Amendment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well India was subject because it wasn't receiving aid, is
                        that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, whatever they had done they had done it before the Pressler
                    Amendment so they were exempt and your right, they were not receiving a lot of
                    aid. They had a very small aid program at that time. So that was the one thing
                    that we were hearing, what about India next door? And of course the other thing
                    was, what about this girls education program that's training women teachers,
                    because one of the problems of girls education is that girls wouldn't go to
                    school with men teachers if they had to board. A project that was theoretically
                    very successful in changing the way that Pakistan thinks about education was
                    being cut off. So in each project you heard about the good that the project was
                    doing and concern about how can you possibly think about cutting it off?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of doing all this sort of grudgingly? What
                        was the attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I think the attitude was, it was the law and there was heavy pressure
                    to do it and so I think everyone was involved in doing it to the best of our
                    ability, but certainly had we had our druthers people would not have been doing
                    that. But it wasn't that you were kind of grudgingly doing it or trying to slow
                    it or delay it or hoping for a new decision at some future point. It was clear
                    that there wasn't going to be any change in that policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling congressional oversight? Were staffers
                        sort of looking over your desk or not or what</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think the staffers were very actively involved in making sure that
                    things were moving forward and you were being called up to the Hill every week
                    to explain where you were and why you aren't moving faster on that or what about
                    this or what about that. So, yeah, that's how the pressure was largely
                    exerted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about girls' schools? How did that, how'd you find
                        phasing that out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, it was difficult because that was an interesting project. That was a
                    project that we were doing a policy-based project. So instead of being out in
                    the provinces directly implementing this project we were giving the Pakistan
                    government rewards for policy changes that it made. So if they made a policy
                    change to institute teacher training for women in X province and they had so
                    many people, so many women in the teacher training school they got a chunk of
                    money for that policy change. So it was, in one way you're just dealing with the
                    government bureaucrats in Islamabad, rather than having to deal with every
                    school that closed or every teacher training program that was being shut down.
                    That in some ways made it easier.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this program was going on were you, even before the
                        Pressler Amendment came along, were you getting complaints you might say
                        from the fundamentalists in Pakistan about doing things with women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I wasn't on the ground there so I'm not as aware of that but I think,
                    yeah, there's always resistance to change but as far as I know that project was
                    being implemented smoothly and again largely by the Pakistani government, rather
                    than by us. I'm sure had we been out more directly involved in that we would
                    have gotten more flak from it but we were kind of the invisible actor in this.
                    Which is a good way to go, by the way, in controversial programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Pakistani government there were people who
                        really wanted to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was reading a book by Bernard Lewis [What Went Wrong?:
                        The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East] about what went
                        wrong, how come Islam has ended up at the bottom of the heap and he mentions
                        the social consequences if a society has women who are ill-educated or
                        uneducated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Of course the traditionalist would say, “But that's how the world has
                    always been. The men have gone out hunting and they've gone to school and
                    they've gotten educated and the women have run the household.” But certainly
                    that's true. If you ignore fifty per cent of the population and that fifty per
                    cent are the women that take care of the kids that seems to make sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any of the projects, for example the
                        school project, was there any follow through on the part of the Pakistanis
                        saying, “Well, okay, if you can't do it we can.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Certainly in some of the projects there was a commitment by the government
                    to continue the program. Since all of our activities require government
                    counterpart funding anyway, some more than others, those that had substantial
                    government counterpart funding and we were just adding to that some quality
                    component the program would continue. In girls' education, for instance, I think
                    that they were committed to continuing to move forward with that. The project
                    was working in two of the most difficult states or provinces in Pakistan and
                    there was a commitment to continue and I think they did continue the
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there sort of “no go” areas? I think of the tribal
                        areas</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WHITE: The Northwest Territories, yeah. There were certainly “no go” areas even
                    in those days. You had the same problems you have now. You had tremendous poppy
                    production in some areas. You had warlords in control in some areas of Pakistan,
                    largely in that area around Afghanistan. And so, yeah, travel was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Afghanistan? Afghanistan at this point was very
                        much under the Taliban, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: By the time I arrived at the desk, the Soviets were in the process of
                    withdrawing. Our commitment, AID's commitment, was to try to maintain the
                    village school programs and the village medical programs and so basically what
                    we were doing was providing medical supplies and school supplies, sending them
                    in by mule train. We were also occasionally having those people come out to
                    Pakistan for training, some of them. And we were providing food. And food was
                    one of the more difficult areas because the question was how did you get it to
                    the remote areas in Afghanistan. We would truck it in Pakistan up to the border.
                    It had to be then transloaded onto Afghan vehicles and as it transited
                    Afghanistan every time the passed a different state, the state trucks would haul
                    it, so it had to be offloaded and each time you offloaded it there was a big
                    chance for problems. And then there were people like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and
                    others who would intercept the food trains and take the food for their armies.
                    So there were a lot of problems in our program because we couldn't go across the
                    border to monitor what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Taliban in control or was it iffy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I think it was iffy at that point. There were just a lot of warlords.
                    It was unclear who was in control in the capital but I think at that point it
                    was not the Taliban, yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we having problems with the Pakistanis to get the
                        food in? Were they taking a certain percentage of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't know that they were taking a certain percentage but certainly I'm
                    sure on the shipping arrangements and all that they were making money. We were
                    working with the agreement of the Pakistani intelligence authorities and the
                    military, but yeah, I'm sure they were getting a cut of</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pakistani intelligence people were sort of the rulers
                        up there, weren't they? They were in charge of certainly the border.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>WHITE: Right, you couldn't do anything without their agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have any problems with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I think the only problem we had was whenever, I went out several times
                    on TDYs and while I would have liked to have talked to the people in control and
                    had a dialogue with them I think that was probably above my pay grade. So I
                    ended up talking to lower level officials and had great trouble in accessing
                    people at the top because they had other counterparts that they dealt with in
                    the embassy. So for me that was a particular problem because I like going
                    directly to the source and discussing things but in that case I didn't. But
                    other than that, no problem. No security problems. You always went with a great
                    deal of trepidation when you were there because things were different. There was
                    an active insurgency going on. There was a lot of unrest with the refugees on
                    the Pakistan side of the border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in Pakistan, as we shut down the program, was the
                        program pretty much run by contractors rather than sort of AID permanent
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, that's just the way of life with AID but AID is still involved. What
                    happens of course is that the contractors provide contract staff who do a lot of
                    the implementation but the programming and the planning and all that is still
                    done by AID and any direct relationships with the government, for instance,
                    those relationships are maintained by AID. So contractors are an implementation
                    tier rather than a policy tier. If you're a long term AID person who remembers
                    when we used to do it all ourselves, you certainly long for those days, because
                    you have a lot more control and it's your own staff doing it, rather than a
                    contract staff. But that was just the way of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems of dealing with contract
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, a number of things. First of all, contract staff, they have their
                    own agenda. If it's an NGO, the agenda, if it's Church World Services or
                    Catholic Relief or some of those, they might have a religious agenda on top of
                    everything that you're trying to do. If it's Harvard University or Michigan
                    State, they have an agenda with their educational program, with the people
                    they're trying to train or they have an issue with their own policy that might
                    not be directly in line with what the U.S. government wants. When you have a
                    powerhouse like a Harvard out there doing things for you and they're out of
                    control it's hard to bring them under control. So those are the kinds of issues,
                    the main issues that we had. Mainly how to manage the agenda that was set out by
                    the U.S. government through AID and to keep people within those parameters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we move over to Thailand and the cross border thing,
                        you say you were sort of taking over from the CIA. Had the CIA actually
                        essentially moved into AID territory and now were trying to get out or how
                        would you describe the thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I think that the Agency has always had programs that were AID-like
                    for people that they were working with and in this case the non-communist
                    resistance, for whatever reason I think the Congress made a determination that
                    that AID-like program should be run by AID. So, yeah, all of a sudden we were
                    working with counterparts that we traditionally hadn't worked with. Instead of
                    working with a government you were working with a series of political groups.
                    And so the questions come up about what authority do you have, who do you sign
                    agreements with, all of those kind of questions. But there's a wonderful,
                    notwithstanding any other part of the law kind of phrase that certain programs
                    like this get authorities that normally AID doesn't have. So both in the Afghan
                    and the Cambodian cross border program there were special authorities that gave
                    us a lot more flexibility than we would ordinarily have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this was because of it was essentially a military
                        operation against communist movements. What could you do? First place, what
                        was the sort of situation on the ground? Are we talking about, was it
                        Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We're talking about working out of the Thai border area into Cambodia and
                    you're talking about the extreme I guess it would be northwest part of Cambodia,
                    bordering on Thailand and there was one province there where a small area of
                    land was controlled by these several non-communist groups. So the situation on
                    the ground, it was not an active military zone. There wasn't fighting at that
                    time. The Khmer Rouge were also up in that area, right adjacent to the
                    non-communist resistance area was the Khmer Rouge stronghold and then there was
                    the rest of Cambodia, governed by Hun Sen, who was a Vietnamese puppet.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The big issue in those days was, since the Khmer Rouge was fighting against the
                    government and the non-communist resistance was also resisting the government,
                    they had worked out on the ground some cooperation relationships with the Khmer
                    Rouge, which was exceedingly sticky. The Congress was very concerned about what
                    is the relationship between the non-communist resistance and the Khmer Rouge and
                    is any of our assistance being given to the non-communist resistance and somehow
                    then getting over to the Khmer Rouge? Those were the kind of policy issues that
                    were being debated. The strong concern among some in the Congress, mainly
                    staffers, I assume, could be members as well, was what about all the rest of
                    Cambodia? What about the people? Shouldn't we be providing an AID program to
                    Cambodia itself? And at one point Congress put into their legislation, to the
                    bill, a requirement that AID conduct a needs assessment in the rest of Cambodia
                    to determine what the humanitarian needs are, as a step towards forming a
                    program there and the administration took the position that AID could not do
                    that. They would not let us go into Cambodia, into the rest of Cambodia, to do
                    this needs' assessment. So in a sense my office was right in the middle of that,
                    with the law telling us that we had to do this and the administration saying
                    that you couldn't do it. And we finally figured out a way to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that there were a lot of NGOs in Cambodia,
                        even in the areas controlled by the Hun Sen government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In Hun Sen's control, yeah, through Phnom Penh and in that area that they
                    directly controlled. So what we did was, we invited those NGOs, international
                    NGOs, up to Thailand and had a meeting there and picked their brains, so to
                    speak and developed our needs' assessment based on what they felt was going on
                    inside of Cambodia. That was a way to satisfy the congressional requirement to
                    do a needs' assessment and yet not put foot into Cambodia. That made everyone
                    happy. That was a good solution to the problem. Of course, as you would guess,
                    the needs' assessment showed there were tremendous needs in Cambodia,
                    humanitarian needs but the problem still remained of how we could provide
                    assistance to areas controlled by that communist state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a period when we did not have relations with
                        Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's correct. So that was the big issue. Our assistance to the
                    non-communist resistance was fairly minimal. We provided food and a few things
                    but at that point there was not a large amount of assistance that we were
                    providing to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of a residue of CIA influence, wanting to
                        pick up intelligence and I would think they would want to continue to do
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think they certainly continued their military support and
                    relationship with those people. They had plenty of people working on that. But
                    of course we were dealing with different actors and there were...we coordinated
                    carefully and closely with them. There wasn't any particular demand on us to
                    provide reporting but through discussions and conversations and coordination
                    certainly a lot of information was passed back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all involved in immigration from, essentially
                        Cambodia to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Only on the margins. Certainly that happened more in the 1975-76 period,
                    where there was huge AID involvement, both along the border and in the refugee
                    camps, in Guam and the Philippines and also even back here in the States in
                    helping to settle people. Certainly AID people very interested in making sure
                    that the people that we directly worked with got resettled somehow. So there was
                    a lot of informal attention given to this as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about up in Laos? Was there spillover, the Hmong and
                        all that? Were we doing anything with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, we were, we continued to work with the Hmong. A lot of the Hmong
                    ended up on the border camps and we continued to supply the border camps. There
                    were trickles of people over all of those years that left the camps and came to
                    the States or to France or other places for resettlement. There were continually
                    people escaping Laos and coming across and where those people had worked for the
                    U.S. government or had other credentials like that, there was a continuing
                    effort to resettle those people. But a lot of the refugees just remained stuck
                    in the camps. So one of the things, when we were working with the non-communist
                    resistance, most of their people were still in border camps on the Thai side of
                    the border. I was trying to institute a program where we would...they were
                    learning Thai or English and things like that.</p>
                <p>I had hoped we would be able to run democracy programs there. We talked about the
                    importance of voting, we gave people kind of decision points so if they were
                    ever to return to Cambodia they would go back with perhaps a stronger sense of
                    democracy than they had just sitting in the camps or studying language. Those
                    kinds of programs were always hard to really get going, for a number of reasons.
                    I think one reason is that NGOs, essentially NGOs ran a lot of the camps and
                    those programs are not the kind of programs that NGOs traditionally think of
                    doing. They were more on the food and humanitarian side. There were issues with
                    the Thai not wanting to do too much in the camps, not wanting to get the camps
                    too advanced, too attractive. So it was difficult, it sounds simple but it's
                    very difficult to get programs going in the camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about East Asian bureau? Did they have much interest

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, I think we worked really closely with the East Asian bureau at State.
                    In fact I probably spent as much time there as I did in my own offices. So we
                    worked really closely on all of these issues. We worked like a team.</p>

                <p>9</p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, although, no, the Cambodia, Afghan stuff was also somehow being
                    dealt with I think by the East Asia office. But, yeah, mainly on the Cambodian
                    stuff was where we did a lot of coordination with State. On the Afghan cross
                    border program there was not as much. It was done at a different level. On the
                    Cambodian side I basically, as the office head, did a lot of the coordination.
                    On the Afghan program my boss did the coordination with State more than I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have anything going in Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We did. What we were trying to do in Burma was, there was a lot of, a lot
                    of refugees on the Thai side of the border. So we intended and tried hard to
                    start a university, in a sense, an education program, border education program,
                    for those young Burmese who were out on that side of the border. We never got
                    that going. There was some congressional support for that. There were a couple
                    of staffers who were quite interested in that but it was, again, one of those
                    politically difficult programs to get the Thai to agree to and to get State...to
                    get everybody on board. So we worked hard on that but never got anything
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the importance of congressional staffers.
                        Often they were the ones who had an agenda and were driving it, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think so. On this particular case in Burma, for instance, I think
                    that perhaps one of the staffers very interested in that had a Burmese wife. But
                    for whatever reason, you're right. I think that a lot of times it was unclear
                    where the strong interest came from, whether it was from the staff or from a
                    member. Unless you were actually called to a member's office the assumption was
                    generally that the staffer was the person pushing this. In some cases you had
                    letters to the Secretary or to the AID Administrator from a member where it was
                    clear the member was involved. But on many of the kind of issues that I dealt
                    with it seemed to be staff driven, that the staffers had a lot of power on the
                    Hill.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started in 1989. Of course, 1989 was the year of, the
                        beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Did any of that reflect
                        itself in where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: A bit, because the bureau that I worked in in AID had Eastern Europe,
                    Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, all in one big Bureau (for
                    Asia, Near East and Europe - ANE) and I was the chief for East Asia, so we had
                    another person working the Middle East (Peter Benedict) and another person
                    working in Eastern Europe (Richard Brown). So all of that, at the office level
                    it all fit together well. I had a sense, from people I worked with out in the
                    field, that they were hearing about and understanding that the communist world
                    was collapsing and looking at their own situation and expecting that at some
                    point Russian aid would dry up to Vietnam and Vietnamese aid would dry up to Hun
                    Sen and that all of a sudden they would march back into Phnom Penh. I think they
                    had unrealistic expectations, as those dominoes started to fall, how it would
                    impact on them, because it was not ever as direct as they thought it might
                    be.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Only very generally, because the other stuff was so big. What we haven't
                    talked about is the Philippines base negotiations were going on and AID was an
                    important part of that, because base conversion into free port zones or whatever
                    became a part of the planning and so we had Pakistan, the Philippines,
                    Afghanistan and Cambodia were the big players. There were some minor things
                    going on in the South Pacific but they were relatively minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Philippine base negotiation? First, what
                        was the situation and then what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Probably the big thing that AID was doing, we were helping fund a program
                    with Elliott Richardson on the U.S. side and a Philippine counterpart to
                    strengthen the private sector and its involvement in the Philippines. Of course,
                    as the base negotiations were going on this kind of U.S.-Philippine private
                    sector-driven thing became important because that would be one way to have these
                    bases start to earn money for the Philippine economy and replace all the money
                    that was going to evaporate when we left. So that was the main thing that we
                    were doing and our relationship then was largely in the sense of planning for
                    the future and how the various bases might be used. We weren't so much on the
                    political side of that one.</p>

                        We'd gone through base negotiation after base negotiation, but this time,

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I guess certainly at my level the sense was that, again, this was a
                    decision that had been made and you tried to implement it as best you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mount Pinatubo, had it erupted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, it had not erupted at the time of most of that planning but somewhere
                    towards the end of that planning it did and there certainly was almost the sense
                    among those people that were still very angry that we were leaving the
                    Philippines that perhaps this was some kind of justice, 'cause it rendered that
                    air force base largely unusable for a long time. But yeah, that happened towards
                    the end of that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting, sort of from your contacts on the
                        Philippine side? Was there a feeling that, in a way, thank God you're
                        leaving or were we the milk cow that they wanted to stay on or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think AID, to some extent, maybe not as much as the Embassy...we tend to
                    deal with certain counterparts and those counterparts tend to be like-minded
                    people. So your counterparts generally were very sad that we were leaving, felt
                    that that was not the way that things should be, but that there was this force
                    out here, the Philippine people, that were making this happen. And so you get
                    locked into maybe thinking, “Well, maybe there's a chance we can stay. If people
                    at this level are thinking those kind of things, maybe it's going to turn
                    around.” It clearly didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Philippines? Did we feel that they
                        were a mature enough country that they could take care of their own
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I couldn't speak for the U.S. government. I think my view of the
                    Philippines, after having dealt with them on a number of these issues, was that
                    there are a lot of extremely talented people, very educated people, in the
                    Philippines and of course that's always bolstered by the fact that a lot of
                    people speak English. That alone makes it seem very different than most of the
                    countries we worked in. But also a sense that even with all of that education
                    and polish, at some level, upper levels in the society, that things just weren't
                    together. That you had a very talented country, a lot of resources and yet
                    things just didn't hang together well, for whatever reason, so that our leaving
                    was perhaps premature, our backing out of that area. Again, that was my
                    impression. I'm not sure how the government viewed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Vietnam War, in the high point of AID, we were
                        all over the place, then all of a sudden you're shrunk down to a few places,
                        in a way, aren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>WHITE: Sort of. I think probably another way to look at that is that a lot of our
                    money, a large percentage of our money, was going to very key, strategic places
                    around the world. Those places were Egypt and Israel and at one point Vietnam
                    and Pakistan and that there were crumbs out there for the rest of the world. So
                    one way to look at it, if you weren't working on one of those key, strategic
                    programs, is that aid was being sucked away from everywhere else to support
                    strategic interests of the United States. If you were working on those strategic
                    programs, it was a very different view because you could see how much that aid
                    was needed and you kind of looked at the rest of the world and said, “Out of all
                    these years of basic education, or primary health care, or whatever, you look at
                    those countries, how far have they gone? They haven't gone very far. So perhaps,
                    maybe more focused, concentrated efforts might pay off more than just trying to
                    serve a lot of countries.” So that's always the debate in foreign aid, as to
                    what you should do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting to Pakistan and Afghanistan, did you see Islam as
                        being a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I personally saw Islam as being a problem only because I didn't understand
                    it and I recognized on my first trip to Pakistan, when I went up country and saw
                    all of the women shrouded in black from head to foot. I'd been to Islamic
                    countries before. I'd been to Bangladesh and Indonesia. But this was a horse of
                    a different color and I realized that there was a big chunk of the world that I
                    had never served in and I did not understand at all. And so that was a problem.
                    I felt that there I was, trying to run a program in a place where I had no
                    understanding at all of the culture and all of the underlying things that were
                    going on. We had people on the ground there responsible for doing that. But for
                    me it's an uncomfortable feeling, working in an area where it's so clear that I
                    don't understand it.</p>
                <p>Yeah, I think, more generally people were starting to sense that something was
                    going on in the Islamic world. When we were working on Afghanistan cross border
                    stuff, for instance, at some point Osama bin Laden surfaced as a very wealthy
                    man who was helping to support the school systems and the medical programs, just
                    like we were and at that point he was looked on as “We don't know who he is or
                    why he's doing this but here's some other, Islamic aid going to help the same
                    kind of people we're working with.” Certainly over time that view of him has
                    changed a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were doing this for a couple of years, we get
                        up to 1991, 1992. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, a couple of things happened. First of all, the person in AID who ran
                    Asia, Near East, South Asia, Pacific Bureau [Assistant Administrator Carol
                    Adelman] decided that was far too much for one person and so they split it up
                    into an Asia bureau and a Middle East bureau and an Eastern Europe office. And
                    the person I had been working for maintained, while the Asia bureau moved she
                    made the argument within AID that the political programs should stay with her
                    and that meant keeping the Philippines, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Cambodia with
                    her, even though some of those programs should have moved to Asia. She
                    maintained the Middle East and Eastern Europe. So there was a date set for when
                    all of the programs in Asia would move to her and we talked about that and I
                    decided that at that point, when those programs moved to the Asia bureau, I
                    would move on. But before that happened AID decided that they wanted to put a
                    person in Japan to help coordinate U.S. foreign assistance with the Japanese
                    foreign aid program, that was now the world's largest program. And my name came
                    out of the computer as having had some Japanese. So I was approached and asked
                    if I would be interested in accepting that job. I said, “Yes” and so in 1991, as
                    those Asia programs were leaving the bureau, I left and went to Japan from 1991
                    to 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow! What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's a good question. When I got there the head of their aid program
                    made it clear that I was there at Japan's request and they had had so much
                    trouble trying to coordinate with AID because we're decentralized that he wanted
                    someone close at hand in the Embassy who could help him, advise them on how they
                    approach AID, who they worked with and all of that. So from Japan's perspective,
                    that was why I was there.</p>
                <p>From our perspective, I was there for several reasons. The Japanese aid program
                    was largely infrastructure transfer to countries. They did almost nothing on
                    policy. They did almost nothing, how should I say it, trying to use their aid as
                    a lever for trying to achieve different kinds of policy in countries. They did
                    nothing on the soft side, that is in democracy, women in development,
                    environment, HIV/AIDS, population. That just was not a part of what they did in
                    their aid program. They built buildings and supplied equipment. So my job was to
                    try to move them towards a program that would look more like our program.</p>
                <p>So those were the two big reasons why I was there. What I did is, I spent most of
                    my day, I learned very quickly that JICA (Japan International Cooperation
                    Agency) was not AID's counterpart, that JICA was more like a consultant. JICA
                    was not part of the government of Japan, for instance. Their aid program was run
                    by their Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So that became my key counterpart and I
                    spent every day over at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, either trying to figure
                    out what they were doing and why, or how I could influence them to do different
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Japanese aid
                        structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Before I went there, my impression was that JICA, their grant aid group,
                    was our counterpart. I quickly learned that their aid structure was very
                    different than that, that what they had was a Ministry of Foreign Affairs that
                    made all of the policy decisions and then a series of implementing bodies, JICA
                    being one, but also their Ministry of Trade and Industry, their Ministry of
                    Fisheries, they put their money out to various implementation organizations. So
                    that was very different from anything I had confronted before and almost
                    immediately I started thinking in terms of, if USAID ever were to become part of
                    the State Department our program would probably start to look more like the
                    Japanese program. While my job was to change them to look like us, what I saw
                    down the pike was possibly us changing to look more like them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your counterparts? Would they have a different
                        attitude than you did, did you find or</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, certainly they had a different attitude. I think the Japanese aid
                    program started as war reparations in the Greater East Asia area where the
                    Japanese had ravaged so many cultures and countries. So in a sense they were
                    paying back the Koreans and the Thai and all of the East Asian countries. They
                    saw aid as a concentric circle, where you put almost all of your money in your
                    neighbors in East Asia and you trickled just a little bit off to Africa and
                    South America and other places, largely because of international community
                    pressure to cover the world, but that East Asia was the primary target. So they
                    could never understand why the U.S. didn't have that same philosophy and why we
                    didn't basically concentrate our aid program on South America and then a little
                    bit elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Another big difference that we had was over the issue of equipment and buildings.
                    They built things, they equipped things. They had a lot of white elephants. They
                    built things that countries couldn't run. They couldn't understand how we could
                    go in with soft assistance, curriculum reform and teacher training. To them
                    those all seemed like interferences in the affairs that should have been of
                    those countries, whereas they were just coming in and doing something that was
                    apolitical and providing a wherewithal for someone to have a better building and
                    perhaps have better research because they had better equipment but they weren't
                    interfering in the structure of the country. So we had some pretty major
                    differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make any difference, you feel, or did they make
                        any difference with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think we made a huge difference on them. Their program now looks very
                    similar to ours. When I first went there, it was the (George H.W.) Bush
                    Administration and they had a program for working with the Japanese called the
                    Global Partnership and under the Global Partnership what we tried to do was
                    institute a few really large cooperation projects around the world. So we
                    started...one way to get them to work in environment, for instance, we
                    negotiated with them to do a joint environmental project in Indonesia, where we
                    put in ten million dollars, the Japanese put in ten million dollars and the
                    Indonesians put in ten million dollars, so a thirty million dollar project to do
                    biodiversity in Indonesia. So we tried to use our money as leverage to get them
                    to do things that they hadn't done before. That Global Partnership started
                    several projects like that, large projects around the world and then all of a
                    sudden the Bush Administration ended and the Clinton Administration came in and
                    we were in the midst of this shift, so the question was what do we do? And we
                    decided to continue with the program but change the name. So we changed the name
                    to the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda and continued to work with the Japanese. We got
                    them to commit a huge amount of money, nine billion dollars, to work on HIV/AIDS
                    and population, in an up front kind of commitment that they would work with us
                    around the world on those areas, because they were receiving a lot of pressure,
                    not only from us, but from the international community to do more in areas like
                    population and HIV/AIDS. They would say, “HIV/AIDS, we don't have that problem
                    in Japan. We don't understand it. So we can't do it.” But they were willing to
                    fund it if they worked with us and we kind of developed the activities and they
                    provided funding. So over time we were able to develop a lot of different
                    projects around the world where we worked together and their aid program
                    gradually started to shift to work on biodiversity and population and HIV/AIDS,
                    a lot of the things that they hadn't done before, democracy, even. So at the end
                    of that period of time I think, yes, they had changed their program
                    substantially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Japanese society, the universities, producing sort
                        of committed do-gooders? I'm using the term in the best sense of the word. I
                        mean people who really wanted to help, because it's such an enclosed society
                        I think it would be hard to bring these people to the fore.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think they had real trouble understanding the way that the U.S.
                    has a sense of responsibility for the world. They're a much more inward-looking
                    society. But a couple things happened. They had a really active Japanese Peace
                    Corps and I think the universities started to change when many of these young
                    Japanese Peace Corps people came back from Africa or Bangladesh or wherever they
                    had been, the South Pacific and enrolled in the university and started looking
                    for ways to continue what they had started overseas. The Japanese government,
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also had a very enlightened look at how the
                    could involve the Japanese people, local governments, local NGOs and the
                    universities in their aid program. So from the top down they also started to
                    involve these people, in really interesting ways that we don't involve groups.
                    For instance, they would form a group of local community people, NGOs,
                    universities, as an evaluation group. Get twenty or thirty people together from
                    a cross section of their society, send them to Indonesia to look at the
                    Indonesia biodiversity program and evaluate it. They would have maybe a movie
                    star and a famous baseball player in this group as well. So these people would
                    come back and talk about what they had seen and why. So the Japanese public,
                    something like 80 or 85 per cent, is in support of their aid program, whereas
                    our public was maybe 15 or 20 per cent, if that, because they did this. As a
                    result of involving people like this, universities started developing programs,
                    development programs that help people understand the importance of economic
                    development in the Third World and it would start producing people that would
                    become advisors to the foreign ministry. So they had a different relationship
                    with society than we have. I think a much more positive relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an observer, did the Japanese become involved with the
                        South Koreans particularly and the Chinese? These are two rather dynamic
                        societies but coming from obviously different backgrounds. How did this work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Interesting. When the Japanese would ask me, “What do you think the
                    biggest AID success story is in the world?” I would always say “Korea.” They
                    would say, “How can that be? Why isn't it somewhere in South America?” I would
                    say, “Well, when we started working in Korea” and even I could say when I went
                    to Korea in the late Sixties. “Korea was one of the poorest countries in the
                    world. It was poorer than many of the African countries. It had been devastated
                    by the Korean War. Now they're like the 12th or 14th leading economy in the
                    world.” And what AID was doing in those days was the old style programs of
                    building cement factories, building the North-South Highway. Infrastructure,
                    what Japan used to do. And so I would say, “With the investment that we made in
                    Korea it's really turned around.” They see Korea as their success story. I
                    always used that because that got into a really rich argument about
                    infrastructure and soft assistant and all of that.</p>

                <p>They had a difficult time in Korea because they had changed Korean culture. They
                    went in and required the Koreans to paint the Korean names off the grave markers
                    of their ancestors and put Japanese names on the grave markers. So there's a lot
                    of hatred of the Koreans towards Japan and there's the “comfort women” issue and
                    all of that. So a discussion of Korea always brought out really interesting
                    things in Japan. I guess they felt that they had poured a lot of money and they
                    had poured a lot of money into Korea. They had not done that as much in China,
                    where you also had tremendous hatred of the Japanese, but their main point in
                    foreign aid to Korea and to China was to start to change the opinion of how
                    people looked at Japan, to get them to forget comfort women and all of that. And
                    they felt that they were making headway. In part they were making headway
                    because as older generations died out and they dealt with younger people that
                    hatred was much less. But they certainly put a lot of money into those
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about North Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had some conversations about North Korea, Iran, Iraq and other places
                    like that because I often had talking points from State to go in and find out
                    what the Japanese were doing and to try to convince them not to provide
                    assistance to Iran or Iraq, specific kinds of assistance. North Korea was one of
                    those as well where occasionally I had to go in and just see what they were
                    doing. They weren't doing much in North Korea.</p>
                <p>Mongolia...as the communist world started to disintegrate, there were
                    opportunities to get the Japanese to take a leadership role. It's Asia, it's
                    where they feel like they have a natural leadership role. Why don't we work with
                    them to get them to be, hold the donor coordination group? Instead of holding it
                    in Paris, France, where they've always been held, why don't we get them to hold
                    the coordination group for Mongolia, which they did. Again, if you look now,
                    Japan is taking a lead on a lot of that stuff. In those days, the first reaction
                    was, “Of course we can't do that. It's Asia, we'd be interested in it but Paris
                    is where that's done and we've never done that before.” But they've really grown
                    into that role well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd had that Japanese experience early on, which had
                        turned you off. Did you feel that you were looking at a new Japanese person,
                        in a way, or were you seeing one develop, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think I appreciated the chance to go back full circle and go back
                    to my original love and to do it not as a poor university student eating noodles
                    with no position in society but doing it as the number two or three person or
                    four person in the embassy, where I commanded a lot of respect. So in part I saw
                    not a new Japanese person but I was in a different position. Therefore I was
                    treated very differently. But I also saw developing confidence in Japan, in
                    terms of their ability to work with other donors. Before you'd talk to people,
                    if I asked the aid people around the world, “What do you think of Japanese
                    counterparts?” when I first went to Japan, they would say, “Oh, Hashimoto-san
                    goes to the meetings but he sits over in a corner of the room and smokes a
                    cigarette and keeps notes but never says anything.” By the time I left Japan,
                    not because of me but just because of the way things were changing,
                    Hashimoto-san was an active participant in those meetings because he had
                    something to say. They were doing the kinds of programs that other donors were
                    doing. The Hashimotos that went out earlier and didn't speak English very well
                    and all of that had been replaced by young Japanese who had good command of
                    English. I must say their Foreign Service program is superb, in terms of
                    producing high level people who speak languages.</p>
                <p>They do something that I think we don't do and that is early on they identify the
                    people who are going to be China hands or French hands or whatever. They send
                    them to university for several years in the country that they're going to
                    specialize in, the language they're going to specialize in. Then they give them
                    several language assignments that enable them to use their language skills. And
                    so you find Japanese Foreign Service people now who, I think, are exceptional at
                    the top layers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there was a difficult time in
                        terms of the Japanese bubble and Thai bubble, they all popped, burst. How
                        did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I found that it affected the Japanese tremendously, in the sense that they
                    felt that they had a development model that worked, the West had a development
                    model that was a failure. So they felt that their investment in infrastructure
                    in East Asia and South Asia and Southeast Asia had led to the “tigers.” They
                    commissioned the World Bank and the IMF to do a study of the East Asian miracle,
                    expecting it to say that Japan's development model led to this and this was
                    right at the time the bubble was bursting and all this. The study eventually
                    said that these countries made right decisions and it gave little or no credit
                    to the Japanese aid program. So that was a crushing blow for them, because they
                    had funded this study with the hopes that it would show something else.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>In Japan it had two effects. One, it made people, the fact that they were
                    experiencing financial difficulties, it made people question why Japan needed to
                    be the leading donor in the world. They were at ten or twelve billion dollars a
                    year, we were at eight. So they were way above us and then everybody else was
                    way down below us. In Japan there's a saying that the tallest nail is the nail
                    that gets hammered down. So everybody came to them to ask for money, instead of
                    coming to us. So there was a lot of domestic pressure on them to reduce their
                    aid program, which they eventually did. So it had that impact.</p>
                <p>In terms of living in Japan, I guess one of the things that I continued to be
                    amazed at was that every restaurant you went to you had to stand in line to get
                    in. You literally did not see the impact in the way that people lived in Japan
                    but certainly you read about it in the newspapers and there were big changes
                    like reducing their aid program and other things, but daily living, you didn't
                    notice it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find living in Japan and Japanese society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well the second time around I loved it. The Japanese were very gracious. I
                    traveled all over the country doing speeches, some for USIA and some just on my
                    own. I taught at a Japanese university and I also went out to other universities
                    as a visiting professor. The second time around I really loved it. I continued
                    to find that the Japanese, they find it hard to accept a foreigner who
                    understands their country and speaks their language a bit. They like to be kind
                    of secretive and think that they have a special society unlike any other in the
                    world. I remember during the rice negotiations, when we were trying to get more
                    U.S. rice into Japan, they were making the argument that the Japanese intestine
                    is not like foreign intestines and can't digest foreign rice. They really do
                    have a view of the world that is unique.</p>
                <p>When you went into a Baskin-Robbins, the American ice cream franchise, and said,
                    “I'll have one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate” you see the clerk's
                    hand starting to sweat, because that's not what you do. So they would go back
                    and ask the manager, “Is it okay that we put a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of
                    vanilla together?” It's a society that lives by so many rules and that
                    everything is a routine. If you go outside of that routine it's difficult for
                    them. So once you understand that, it's wonderful, trying to figure out what
                    little kind of things are going on in every situation you're in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WHITE: When I first went there it was Ambassador Armacost [Ed: served from May
                    1989 to July 1993], who was absolutely wonderful, received AID into the embassy
                    with open arms and was very supportive and then Mondale came [Ed: served from
                    September 1993 to December 1996] and he was even better. We got along really
                    well together. Anytime I asked him to go out and give a speech or go visit, he
                    always did it and very gracious. Then just as I was leaving Ambassador Foley
                    [Ed: served from November 1997 to April 2001] came and I overlapped with him for
                    a short period, several months. He was on a steep learning curve. Mondale, as
                    far as I could tell, didn't have a learning curve. He was the kind of guy who
                    was...he would just absorb everything and then go back in the right way. Foley
                    struggled a little bit at the beginning, in just learning what it was to be an
                    ambassador and how to do it. But all three ambassadors were wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find the rest of the embassy? Japan is not a
                        country where AID, since MacArthur's time, has had much of a presence. All
                        of a sudden you're there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, but I was really well accepted. When I went there the big issue was
                    should I have an independent office or should I be folded into one of the
                    traditional embassy sections? So they decided to put me in the econ section,
                    because the econ section had monitored Japan's aid program before I got there.
                    Also an issue was would they continue to do that or would I take over those
                    monitoring functions that the econ section had done? The other issue was should
                    I go in with the rank of a minister/counselor, co-equal with the
                    minister/counselor for econ, or not? They decided not to make me a
                    minister/counselor for development but just a counselor for development and that
                    was fine with me. I'm not interested in that. So I sat in the econ section and
                    that was good.</p>
                <p>I worked in partnership with the U.S. economists and also the local economists
                    that had worked on Japan affairs. We became our own team of Japan ODA (Office of
                    Development Assistance) or development experts. Had not problem within the econ
                    section. Had no problem with the other, what I did, in a sense stepped on the
                    toes of many different groups, the political section, the Foreign Commercial
                    Service. The kind of things that I was working on were the kind of things that
                    they had worked on traditionally with Japan. They quickly saw me as an aid
                    expert, knowing what I was talking about, a lot of that stuff and all of those
                    things came to me with no conflict within the embassy. So that went really,
                    really well.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>At some point, when the econ, that econ minister/counselor left, we did separate
                    AID off and moved to another floor and became our own office [Ed: The State
                    Department publication “Key officers of the Foreign Service lists Mr. White as a
                    separate AID office in its Fall 1994 and July 1995 booklets]. That was good and
                    bad. That was not something that I instigated. It happened partially because of
                    space and a lot of other things. For me the bad news was I no longer sat in the
                    classified section of the embassy. So it was much more difficult to have access
                    to all of the classified cables and I had no place to store them and all of that
                    and I missed that part of it but that was the only part that I missed, having a
                    separate AID office. But the embassy was wonderful. Never had any issues with
                    the embassy, other than GSO issues that you have everywhere you go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General services office, those are housekeeping matters.
                        You mentioned the Foreign Commercial Service. Did we get into any problems
                        between Japanese aid and American aid, the difference between John Deere and
                        Kubota or something, different types of tractors or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: One of the other big things that I went to work on, my original mandate,
                    was to work on Japanese tied aid, the fact that they not only built buildings
                    and supplied equipment but that the equipment they supplied was all Japanese and
                    the world community, through the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD,
                    had tried to get all donors to untie their aid, saying that the fair thing for
                    any country was to be able to pick the John Deere or Kubota or whatever tractor
                    was most suited to their needs and the best price and if the Japanese were
                    continuing to tie their aid that was something that we needed to work on. So I
                    worked on that really hard with the Department of Commerce and over time we got
                    the Japanese to gradually untie their loan aid. They do something that we don't
                    do. They provide loans to countries. So the argument was if you're loaning India
                    the money, that money in a sense is Indian money that they should be able to do
                    with as they want, including procuring from whatever source they want to.
                    Eventually we won that argument through a lot of hammering at all of the
                    international meetings of the OECD and through my efforts. Every time there was
                    a big Japanese loan program, say loan program for telecommunications in India,
                    the telecom people would be out talking to us about how do we get the Japanese
                    to open this for our market. Another one that the Japanese worked on a lot were
                    railroads. They built a lot of railroads and bought a lot of engines and things
                    like that, so General Electric and General Motors, they would be out immediately
                    to Tokyo, to meet with me, to meet with Foreign Commercial Service, to make the
                    rounds of all the procurement agents in Japan, to talk about opening the bid. So
                    I spent a lot of time on that. That was maybe the most contentious area that I
                    worked in but we were very successful in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another thing that was happening during the time you were
                        there was essentially the collapse of the Soviet Union, particularly in
                        Asia. Were the Japanese involved there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WHITE: What I saw was more on the margins of the issue. Japan had its own
                    problems with Russia, the Northern Islands and so the relationship between Japan
                    and Russia was a difficult relationship. While I was there a couple of
                    interesting things happened. We talk about the U.S. diplomacy with China through
                    ping-pong diplomacy. What I call wild bird diplomacy happened in Japan. A
                    Japanese NGO, the Wild Bird Society, found that certain birds migrate from the
                    Northern Islands in Russia down to Japan and then back and they were able to
                    start a dialogue between Japan and Russia about wild birds that eventually
                    bloomed out into a more political discussion. But that was one difficult area.
                    Another area that I worked on related to that was something I call trilateral
                    projects. I found that if the U.S. and Japan were working together to support a
                    project it neutralized a lot of the negative feelings, either towards the U.S.
                    in certain places or towards Japan. So we were able to do some joint projects,
                    the U.S., Japan, Russia, where it just cancelled out the Northern Islands issue
                    and other things. So I was on the margins of that. What I did not see was the
                    more political issues between Japan and Russia. A lot of things were playing out
                    at that time on the political side, as the Soviet Union was disintegrating and
                    everybody was trying to position themselves for what might come next, including
                    Japan. Of course there were also the issues of the United Nations and what
                    Japan's role would be in the United Nations, on the Security Council. There were
                    a lot of those kinds of issues, as well as the trade issues that we all are
                    familiar with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Soviet Union broke up and all the “sans” emerged,
                        the Central Asian countries. Were the Japanese interested in this or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, this was at a time after the Mongolia Consultative Group meeting was
                    a big success, Japan had run it, that Japan decided to try to play a role in all
                    of the stans. They tried to become the consultative group host instead of France
                    for the stans and they did that successfully. As I said, every Japanese trading
                    company interested in trade had specialists and they had specialists for each of
                    the stans and they had lots of interests, oil pipelines and selling their Kubota
                    tractors and all of that. So, yeah, Japan took a big interest in being actively
                    involved in what went on there, politically and economically, after those
                    countries became independent and took the lead in the consultative group
                    meetings and took the lead in being the number one donor in dollar terms for
                    many of those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese doing anything in Latin America; there
                        was a large Japanese immigrant community in Brazil, and the president of
                        Peru was Fujimori. Was there much going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>WHITE: Certainly, traditionally, in the Japanese aid program they had a category
                    for overseas Japanese. So they provided a significant amount of assistance to
                    Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, where there had been a lot of large migrations
                    of Japanese in the past. They provided assistance to those communities, to be
                    able to come back to Japan and get an education and that kind of stuff, more
                    USIA kind of fellowships and grants and all of that. But they also provided
                    bilateral assistance to Latin America, in fairly small terms. The old formula
                    was seventy per cent of Japanese aid should go to East Asia and ten per cent
                    should go to Africa, ten per cent to South America and ten per cent to South
                    Asia. That was kind of their tradition, how they saw aid. But a lot of pressure
                    was on them to do more in Africa and at certain points to do more in Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>We had a State Department, the head of ARA, Latin America affairs bureau, came to
                    Japan a number of times and developed a good working relationship with the
                    Japanese and it was all around something called the Partnership for Development
                    and Democracy in Latin America, which was a State Department initiative and they
                    wanted Japan's aid program to join in that, as a partner with AID, to support
                    activities, mainly in democracy. So that became a major thing that I worked on
                    and we got the Japanese to actually take a role as a leader in one of the
                    working groups under this PDD and to up their assistance somewhat to Latin
                    America and to try project areas that they hadn't tried before like environment
                    and democracy. So the answer is, while they didn't up their program that much
                    they responded to pressure and they inched their program up for Latin America
                    and for Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been with AID a long time, was there a growing
                        international aid group, I mean were the individual donors coalescing,
                        rather than everybody doing their thing and did you find yourself in a way
                        part of this jointness as a representative in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, I think there was at least some sense, there was more of a sense,
                    that if donors cooperate together you can get more done than if everybody goes
                    their own separate way and while philosophically people would agree to that,
                    when it got down to the rubber meeting the road everyone still did their own
                    thing, because the requirements for developing projects and the way that we fund
                    them and the reporting we do is so different from one donor to another that it's
                    very hard to cooperate. That of course is an argument, if it's difficult for us
                    it's even more difficult for the host country, who has to keep different kinds
                    of books and different reporting for every donor they deal with. So there's been
                    a lot of attempts at the Development Assistance Committee level at the OECD to
                    develop standard reporting formats and standard budget formats and all of that
                    but it never goes anywhere because most donor programs are based on the politics
                    of a situation and things other than the development itself. So those efforts
                    haven't ever gone anywhere. So while theoretically I think people are much more
                    willing to say, “When we work together things happen better than if we don't”
                    practically they don't do it, even now. Certainly over time there's at least an
                    awareness that is an issue.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in 1998 you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: By 1998 I had planned to depart post and retire. Two things happened, I
                    guess. I started getting pressure from the State Department to accept a
                    nomination to be ambassador to Laos. I also had a strong invitation to go to the
                    embassy in Mexico and run the foreign aid program at the embassy there, in a way
                    similar to what I'd done in Japan. So I decided to do that and I went to Mexico.
                    I was pressured a lot by State to take this position in Laos and I started the
                    process with State and somewhere in the process I withdrew my name as ambassador
                    to Laos. A very difficult decision, maybe the most difficult decision I've ever
                    had to make and it was based on a whole series of factors some personal, some
                    policy related. But anyway I was in Mexico at that point, so I stayed in Mexico
                    from 1998 through I guess 2002 and I retired then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In Mexico we had a very small aid program that was being closed out
                    altogether. Aid has always been a difficult issue with Mexico, because Mexico is
                    one of those very proud countries that doesn't like to admit that it receives
                    aid. So we never, in the history of aid to Mexico, we've never had a government
                    to government program. Rather, we worked with NGOs and others to do specific
                    things in very poor areas or in Chiapas or other places in Mexico, but we did
                    not work through the government. So when I got there, an interesting thing had
                    happened. The whole country was on fire and those fires were generating smoke
                    all the way from Chiapas, if you looked in the satellite photos that smoke was
                    coming up all the way up to Houston and Dallas and the Southwest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was real fire. What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: After a number of very dry years, fires started, partially agricultural
                    fires that got out of control but also storms and lightning and place that had
                    never burned before, like the rain forest in Chiapas, that had always been so
                    wet that it would never burn, had gone through a number of droughts and all of a
                    sudden it was burning. It was causing cities in the United States to have
                    environmental alerts and all of that, so the U.S. Congress started putting
                    pressure on us to do something about it in Mexico. Now the Mexican government,
                    in order to do disaster response you have to get an official request from the
                    government and the government was unwilling to ask us for help. So we found a
                    way. We went in and negotiated with them and got them to send us a letter
                    agreeing to accept our assistance, because that wasn't a request. That letter
                    came in and we were able to provide U.S. firefighters and the U.S. Forest
                    Service. So my first few months there I was working on fires.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Out of that grew something very interesting. That is, the first agreement between
                    us and the government, eventually we worked it in a way that our money didn't go
                    directly to the Mexican government. We worked through a Mexican NGO but the
                    agreement was between us and the government. So that was the first time we had
                    actually come to a government to government agreement. So that was one large
                    area I worked in.</p>
                <p>The next area, that also came from congressional pressure, was tuberculosis.
                    Mexico had a tremendous problem with tuberculosis and people were finding that
                    they could cross the border and get treated in Texas or California, Arizona or
                    New Mexico and so those costs weren't being passed on to the government of
                    Mexico but were being passed on to our hospitals and we were starting to
                    actually shut hospitals down that couldn't afford to continue to treat people on
                    an unreimbursed basis. So the Congress wanted us to work in tuberculosis in
                    Mexico, to strengthen Mexico's government responsibilities there so that people
                    wouldn't cross the border to get treated. For that one we actually came up with
                    a government to government agreement with the Ministry of Health of Mexico. So
                    we worked on tuberculosis.</p>
                <p>And we had a number of other programs. Democracy, the democracy program was a
                    tremendous success in Mexico. We worked directly with the government on freedom
                    of information, a new freedom of information law similar to ours. We worked with
                    the Mexican Congress to strengthen their capacities.</p>
                <p>So we had a vibrant program in Mexico. Rather than shutting the program down, as
                    was originally intended, the program grew to around $30-35 million a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you talk about democracy programs. This is just about
                        the time when the PRI (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Institucional) lost a
                        real election [July 2000]. Did we have our fingers in that pie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, we were involved in the elections by working with NGOs and others as
                    election watchers and we funded President Carter and other election observers to
                    come down and observe the election and of course the PRI was swept out of power
                    after sixty or seventy years of being in power and President (Vicente)Fox came
                    in with a real desire to work with us and to improve relations with the United
                    States. And so there was a tremendous opening of possibilities there for doing
                    things that got shut down after 9/11 a bit. But we were able to, I think, move
                    to a new phase in our relationship with Mexico in our aid program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Mexican government, the
                        officials there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WHITE; Yeah, officials, difficult. Mexico's a very proud place and so you had to
                    be exceeding careful with the words you used and what you said. I remember once,
                    a Mexican government official got a hold of the AID website, where we talked
                    about providing assistance for areas of Mexico like Chiapas and that official
                    edited the entire webpage and sent it to me and said, “Here's the kind of things
                    you should be saying.” He took out every mention of poverty or assistance or aid
                    or anything like that. So it was a difficult working situation.</p>
                <p>There's also a sense among government officials that the gringos are, that
                    there's always an ulterior motive for something. So if you're going in to say,
                    “Can we help you fight fires? We have U.S. firefighters and equipment and spray
                    planes and satellite pictures and all of this” they will say, “Yes, but what do
                    you really want? You wanna take pictures of the Chiapas forest with your planes
                    so you can use it for military purposes.” So no matter what it was, how simple
                    or how complex, they would seek the ulterior motive and that's what you would
                    talk about, rather than the real thing that was on the table. So that was, it
                    was a challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the NGO organizations in Mexico? Was it
                        evolving or was it relatively mature or</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's a good question. There were a number of NGOs that AID had worked
                    with over many years, because that's, we worked with the NGO community. Those
                    NGOs were fairly strong but there were only a few of them, mainly in environment
                    and population and we had worked with them through U.S. counterpart NGOs and so
                    we had developed strong relationships between the Nature Conservancy U.S. and
                    the Nature Conservancy Mexico or Conservation International U.S. and
                    Conservation International Mexico. So those few NGOs were quite strong and then
                    there were lots of other NGOs that were not very strong. The Mexican government
                    policy towards NGOs was medieval. Again, they felt that NGOs represented an
                    unseen guiding hand that was trying to influence events in Mexico and the
                    funding was coming from elsewhere, mainly from the North but to some extent from
                    Europe. So they were seen as almost subversive in some ways. So part of what we
                    were trying to do was work to strengthen the relationship between the Mexican
                    government and NGOs, have them better understand what NGOs were about. So that
                    was a major part of what I was doing was working on that relationship.</p>
                <p>But I think NGOs in general were like NGOs anywhere: a lot of heart and not so
                    much mind. They didn't have the practicalities down. How do you keep books, how
                    do you write good information reports to donors? But they were out there as best
                    they could to do good.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things about our relations with both Canada and
                        Mexico is that you got government to government, Washington to Ottawa or
                        Washington to Mexico City and then the practical relationship, which is
                        cross borders and governors of states call governors of states or police
                        chiefs call police chiefs or almost any little, did you find yourself and
                        particularly NGO or AID things, that sort of thing happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yeah, we did, in our democracy program we funded a lot of exchanges of
                    mayors, for instance, and we found ways that people working on similar problems
                    were able to get together and discuss them. So in the Caribbean coastal area
                    they were working on flood control, how do you keep the bay from invading the
                    city? We would take them to Florida, those mayors and develop a relationship
                    with a mayor who was working on a similar problem there. A lot of what we did in
                    the democracy area in the early days were those kind of exchanges, with
                    governors as well and other local officials. We did similar things with NGOs.
                    But mainly we funded NGO counterparts to work on similar problems. I agree with
                    you that those people to people things are important.</p>
                <p>Now NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), this was before my time, but
                    somewhere towards the negotiation of NAFTA someone recognized that NAFTA didn't
                    deal with environmental issues and out of that, people were able to leverage a
                    huge chunk of money, I forget how much it was, now, either thirty million or
                    fifty million dollars, AID created a Mexican NGO, environmental NGO, that was
                    able to receive that money in an endowment fund. So that grew directly out of
                    someone's very quick interest and ability to take a NAFTA deficiency and turn it
                    around. So the money went into an environmental endowment fund, managed by this
                    group, who would then use it to work with local Mexican NGOs on environmental
                    issues and that local NGO has been able to attract a lot more money into the
                    endowment fund. It's now up to over a hundred million dollars.</p>
                <p>So, again, those were the kinds of activities. We were working on a higher order
                    of development issues in Mexico than we would have been working on in Nigeria or
                    Bangladesh or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself working against the entrenched power
                        of the unions? I think of the teachers union or the petroleum workers union,
                        I'm sure there are others, after all this is where PRI's power comes
                        from</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think that we did not, only because we weren't working in areas where we
                    would come head to head and head clash with the unions. But, yeah, the unions
                    were really, really strong in Mexico, just like they are here and they keep a
                    lot of things from happening because they're very traditional and conservative
                    and don't like change.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any other area we haven't talked about in
                        Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The population area, I guess, only because that was such an interesting
                    area because you have the Catholic Church. AID had worked in the population area
                    since its very beginnings in Mexico, all through NGOs and there had always been
                    a very serious issue between the population NGOs and the government population
                    program and the Church. But the way we worked through NGOs and the NGOs worked
                    with the Mexican government, those issues largely were deflected away from AID
                    and they had to be handled by the Mexican government. So we weren't battling
                    directly with the Church but we were battling with the U.S. Congress because
                    there were people in the U.S. Congress who don't like the population program and
                    who would continually write congressional letters to the ambassador questioning
                    five women that he had talked to from Chiapas who had had abortions and was AID
                    money involved in this? So there was always a political issue on the table with
                    population.</p>
                <p>AID had worked in population from the beginning and the Mexican government had
                    gotten really good and was doing a really good job and so we, as I was moving to
                    Mexico, hoping to use the U.S.-Japan cooperation and the nine billion dollars I
                    had developed for cooperation between the U.S. and the world and Japan, I was
                    planning to implement that in Mexico. AID people were talking about phasing out
                    of the population program in Mexico. So one of my first jobs there was to phase
                    out of a program that we had supported forever and one that I wanted to
                    continue. But we did it. We, in a sense, held a graduation ceremony for Mexico.
                    The Mexican government was concerned about a couple of things. One, we had been
                    a source for condoms and they were willing to provide the money to buy the
                    condoms but they wanted to continue to use the supply channels and all of that.
                    So there were some issues like that but in general it was one of those very
                    happy circumstances where we gave the Mexican government a lot of face and
                    credit and we were able to graduate an AID program.</p>
                <p>As I guess a final comment on that, the one thing that I was able to do there
                    that was unique, there were a lot of different players. There was the Mexican
                    social security system, there was the Mexican Ministry of Health, there was a
                    private sector social security system, all of these different health systems and
                    we had worked with all of them in population but there was no overarching
                    program where they all cooperated together. As a part of this graduation
                    exercise we were able to get all of the different players together and go out
                    and visit everybody's projects as a team and see what the strengths and
                    weaknesses of each program was. That set into place a kind of coordination
                    committee that continues, that works on those issues. So I felt good about
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 2002 you retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I retired.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very fruitful career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Long career. I had hoped that when I retired I would have time to kind of
                    go back and think about it and this, probably more than anything else, has led
                    me along that trail and hopefully I'll be able to do a little more with
                    that.</p>
