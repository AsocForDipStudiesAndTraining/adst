                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an oral history interview with Ambassador Charles
                        J. Nelson, an educator, government official and diplomat. Until July 1981,
                        he was an associate professor at Howard University's School of Human Ecology
                        in Washington, DC where he specialized in teaching, student counseling and
                        advisement, thesis direction, administration, curriculum and course
                        development, university committees, and proposal writing. He was also
                        initiator and program coordinator for the Hubert Humphrey Fellowship
                        Program. Ambassador Nelson is a former United States Ambassador to the
                        Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Swaziland and the Kingdom of Lesotho,
                        having served thus from 1971 to 1974. He has also had a number of other
                        major diplomatic assignments with the Department of State, the Agency for
                        International Development, International Cooperation Administration, the
                        Mutual Security Agency, and he has been an associate director of the Peace
                        Corps. This interview is being sponsored by the Phelps-Stokes Fund as part
                        of an oral history project on Black Chiefs of Mission. The interview is the
                        first in a series. It is being held Friday, October 30, 1981 in Washington,
                        DC. Celestine Tutt, interviewer.</hi>

                <p>Ambassador Nelson, what were the events which led to your entry into the
                    diplomatic service?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NELSON: If we're talking about my involvement in the Foreign Service, I started
                    in 1952 with the Mutual Security Program in the Philippines. In terms of direct
                    employment with the Department of State as an Ambassador, that began in 1971 at
                    which time I was serving as Director of the Economic Mission to Tanzania. It was
                    very much a surprise to me that a person came out from Washington to a meeting
                    that I was attending in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and indicated that I was under
                    consideration and I was going to be appointed, or recommended for appointment,
                    as Ambassador to Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. At the time I was under
                    consideration by the Economic Assistance Program to return to Tanzania for a
                    second tour as head of the Economic Mission there, so all I can say is that it
                    was a surprise to me. I think that the person who possibly precipitated this
                    event was the then administrator of the Agency, Dr. John Hannah, who was
                    formerly president of Michigan State University. My assumption is that on the
                    basis of my work with the AID Agency or the Economic Assistance Program, that a
                    recommendation did flow from the Agency to the Department of State in the sense
                    that I might serve as an ambassador. On occasion, people are taken from the
                    Economic Assistance Program for this particular purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your first impressions of the new spots, new
                        posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Botswana?. I'd never been to southern Africa previously, and, of course,
                    to reach Botswana we had to go through South Africa. South Africa we've all read
                    and heard about. That was the beginning of some understanding of the situation
                    or the geographical context and political context within which Botswana finds
                    itself. Botswana is a large country ... large in area, small in population. I
                    had read about Seretse Khama, who was then the president of Botswana.</p>
                <p>As I was saying, to me it was significant in terms of the geographic context in
                    which Botswana finds itself. I guess my questions were about such things ...
                    where are you going to live, the kinds of staff do I have to work with, how you
                    will be received. I was the first American ambassador to these countries. There
                    had been representation there previously, but at the Consul General level.
                    Therefore, in a sense, it was a kind of challenge to see how I could represent
                    my country vis-a-vis Botswana and how in a sense I could be supportive of
                    Botswana in terms of its interests and its concerns, and to relate the United
                    States positively to them. With my background in economic assistance work, one
                    of my main concerns was seeing how, or determining how, the United States could,
                    through its representation there, particularly the AID Program, how it could
                    reinforce and support the development activity which was taking place in
                    Botswana.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>As a part of my functioning in Botswana I also carried a second title of Economic
                    Coordinator for the area, and this, I think, was a particular focus of mine,
                    because to me, Botswana has tremendous potential and significant resources, and
                    it had a government and leadership that was, in my view, dedicated to the
                    advancement of the country and of its people. And in that area, it was also, I
                    think, significant to see it was a government which, in a real sense, was
                    non-racial. In other words, the government was populated by Botswanans of
                    European extraction as well as African extraction, and when you place that in
                    juxtaposition to South Africa, it takes on some additional significance.</p>
                <p>I think it was also obvious there that Botswana at that time had Rhodesia to its
                    north, Namibia, Angola and it had ferry connection across the Zambezi, I guess
                    it was, to Zambia. Its main outlet, however, was through South Africa in terms
                    of trade, transportation and all the rest, and the railroad, which was the main
                    vehicle for transportation of goods and commerce, etc. was the new Rhodesian
                    Railway. So in a sense, this gives you, or should give someone, some
                    appreciation of where Botswana found itself and the context within which it was
                    attempting to give real meaning to its independence at the time I was there. I
                    think this probably still exists today. Botswana is a member of the Customs
                    Union of which South Africa was a participant, and at that time also, although
                    this has changed, the currency in Botswana was the South African rand.</p>
                <p>So in sum, I guess you can say that here I was traveling through South Africa to
                    reach the capital of Botswana, becoming quite aware of where Botswana found
                    itself in many contexts, and being aware also that this was a country which had
                    and has significant resources, but at the same time, as it attempted to give
                    meaning to its independence, certainly had many constraints. And these
                    constraints were not only internally in terms of human resources and the
                    development of the human resources to provide leadership and administration and
                    management for that country, but the constraints of the geographical context in
                    which it found itself. Because in reality, Botswana in Africa has a very tenuous
                    physical, not quite a relationship — what I am thinking about here is that in
                    terms of black Africa, it was in a sense more distant, but in terms of southern
                    Africa — South Africa in a kind of way is having significant control vis-a-vis
                    Botswana and Botswana's access to the world. I guess the term is access, because
                    its access to black Africa was in a sense a ferry across the Zambezi to Zambia.
                    And this has a meaningful effect on the means of access which Botswana had and
                    still has, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of that ... more about that geographic context,
                        would you say the same really apples to Lesotho and Swaziland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NELSON: Lesotho at that time was, and still is, of course, totally surrounded by
                    South Africa, although one of the so-called independent nations within South
                    Africa now is on its border, one of the Bantustans, in other words. Swaziland is
                    in a somewhat similar situation but it has ready access, or linkage with
                    Mozambique, so in a sense, Swaziland could go both ways: through the Republic or
                    through Mozambique. Lesotho does not have that advantage. And the interesting
                    thing is that if I were to fly from Botswana to Lesotho or fly to Swaziland, in
                    each instance if I was using private means or even the Air Attach� aircraft
                    which was stationed in South Africa, we had to get overflight permission from
                    the Republic of South Africa in order to reach Lesotho or to reach
                    Swaziland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to request that every time you had to go from
                        Botswana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Clearance, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clearance ... to go to your other two posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Right. If I went by land, by car, which I did quite often, of course
                    you'd have to go through the border post at one, when you crossed into South
                    Africa from Botswana, or when you crossed from South Africa into Lesotho you'd
                    go through one border post of the South African Government, the border post of
                    the Botswanan Government, as well as the border post of the Lesotho Government,
                    or the Swazi Government, or whatever the case might be. And this is again
                    another manifestation of where these three countries, and how these three
                    countries, in a sense, were situated. And, of course, we all know their policies
                    as they were against the policies of South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk more about the differences, please, in the
                        policies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NELSON: The difference between South Africa and the policies of South Africa and
                    the three countries? Well, I think the main difference really is that these were
                    so-called functioning, multiracial democracies — that particularly applies to
                    Botswana — open societies with a franchise extended and participation in
                    government extended to all the people, and, of course, this is directly contrary
                    to the Republic. So I think that's the main distinction I would draw. It is also
                    true that Lesotho had very meager resources; its primary resources, its manpower
                    or human power. Swaziland is more favorably endowed and, of course, Botswana has
                    tremendous endowments, but against South Africa, which has very, very
                    significant resources, which has a significant military establishment, and all
                    the rest, the three countries were at a distinct disadvantage and certainly
                    could not, in any way, be said to have the power base which, in any way, could
                    contend with that of South Africa. Therefore, in their attempts to bring a real
                    sense of viability to their being, very adroit, skillful and in a sense,
                    dedicated leadership was required, or is required. And there is one other factor
                    and that is that, for example, in the case of Lesotho, its primary resource was
                    the repatriation of wages from the employment of its people in South Africa in
                    the mines and other activities, but primarily in the mines. And that makes a
                    country such as Lesotho very vulnerable. Swaziland also had workers in South
                    Africa as well as Botswana, but Botswana and Swaziland were not dependent upon
                    the export of manpower to South Africa for their livelihood. In a sense, this
                    was an imperative for Lesotho.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe United States presence in Botswana
                        prior to your becoming Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NELSON: In Botswana we had an AID mission; correction, we had AID mission
                    representation. When I say AID mission I mean the Economic Assistance Program
                    had personnel in Botswana. We had, in those days, a USIS library, and so forth,
                    although we did not have American USIS personnel. And there was a small Embassy
                    staff headed by a consular officer. This situation, more or less, remained the
                    same during my tenure in Botswana, although there were significant increases in
                    terms of the personnel of the Economic Assistance Program, both contractual
                    personnel and direct employees of the U.S. Government. The USIS person was
                    stationed in Lesotho and did visit Botswana and Swaziland, as the case may be.
                    The headquarters of the AID program was in Swaziland, but the head of the AID
                    program would visit Botswana or Lesotho, again as the case may be. In other
                    words, my main place of residence was Botswana. We had embassies in the other
                    two countries headed by charg�s, and when I would visit them, of course, I would
                    become responsible for the Embassy. The AID director, the director of the
                    Economic Assistance Program was in Swaziland, the head of the USIS program was
                    in Lesotho. In a sense what it was was a divvying up of the heads of various
                    agencies between the various countries. Now in each of the countries we did have
                    a Peace Corps director and, of course, a Peace Corps staff and Peace Corps
                    volunteers. They did not have one Peace Corps director for the three countries,
                    but they had a director for each country. That situation has changed now, and
                    each of the countries stands on its own feet in terms of U.S. representation,
                    because there is a USIS person, an ambassador, and an AID director in each of
                    the three countries. I was told from time to time when I tried to reinforce, in
                    a sense, the representation of the other branches of U.S. Government, that this
                    could not be done, so I served the three countries because, in a sense, at that
                    time there was some concern about the size of U.S. representation abroad;
                    therefore, one USIS person serving three countries, one ambassador serving three
                    countries, and so on ... needless to say, that changed. I was there for three
                    years — a little over three years — and that changed almost immediately after I
                    left.</p>

                <p>NELSON: It changed in the sense that you ... it wasn't immediately after I left.
                    I think the third ambassador, or the third appointment to Botswana served only
                    Botswana. And I think this, in a sense, to me is better because you can devote
                    your full attention and time to the country of your assigned responsibility;
                    trying to serve three countries is not easy in terms of time-sharing and all the
                    rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure. How did you allocate your time to those three
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I spent most of my time in Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was by far the larger of the three.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NELSON: Larger in size. But Lesotho is smallest in size but largest in
                    population. I spent most of my time in Botswana; I would say six to eight months
                    out of the year were spent in Botswana, and the rest was spent in the other two
                    countries. Always, I was always in the countries for their national day, and I
                    did go at particular junctures where we felt that something was critical or
                    whatever. But it was somewhat difficult, and participating in this way, you did
                    not come to know the people, the government officials, and just in a plain
                    sense, the country, as well as the U.S. programs, as well as you would like. In
                    fact, in a sense, you were dipping in and dipping out, although we exchanged
                    cables and all the rest of it; cables, different correspondence, telephone
                    calls, or whatever the case might be, are not a substitute for face to face
                    actual physical presence in a particular country or place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe United States policy towards
                        Botswana or towards any of those countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, let's take Botswana. I think that you can't ... it's difficult to
                    talk about ... and I wasn't assigned to South Africa ... in southern Africa, and
                    when I say southern Africa I think we have to talk about the Republic, talk
                    about Botswana, talk about Lesotho, Swaziland, Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia and
                    so forth and so on. And you look at that in terms of 1971. Here you are in an
                    independent black-ruled country within southern Africa, Botswana, a country
                    which, I think, is truly a friend of the United States. There was a functioning
                    multiparty democracy, which makes it, in a sense, unique, not only in southern
                    Africa, but unique in terms of Africa because there just aren't too many
                    functioning “multi-party democracies” in Africa. And, therefore, you decide that
                    U.S. representation, policy representation in a country such as Botswana should
                    be not only significant in solely Botswanan terms, but also should be
                    significant within the context of southern Africa and the kind of government
                    that it represented in that area, as well as Africa at large, as well as the
                    world. And I would say that we had a policy which ... I would say the policy of
                    the United States Government to Botswana was supportive and it accorded with the
                    interest of the United States because of what we were there for in terms of
                    furthering U.S. interest. And in a sense accorded with the interests of Botswana
                    as we look at Botswana in isolation, but Botswana doesn't exist in isolation,
                    and therefore you have the kind of anomalies or paradoxes, or however you might
                    wish to say it, as to at that time the embargo of Rhodesia and then you have the
                    Byrd Amendment ... you have to go and explain that and so forth and so on ...
                    the United States vis-a-vis Rhodesia....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain that amendment, please?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well, you know, this was in terms of strategic minerals and stockpiles in
                    the United States. We at one time were not purchasing Rhodesian resources. We
                    had an embargo against Rhodesia ... and it was a leaky embargo, but officially
                    this was the case. But then there was an amendment proposed, as I remember, by
                    Byrd, which would, in a sense, condone trade ... officially condone trade
                    between the United States and Rhodesia. You know there was an attempt there to
                    assess the further independence process, to isolate Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>There was also our relationship, or our position vis-a-vis Angola. Angola borders
                    on Botswana and one of its main tributary rivers rises in Angola. And then there
                    was, of course, Namibia, which is still an issue. And there was South Africa and
                    its apartheid and other policies, which are still an issue. And our presence and
                    representation in Botswana, while supportive of Botswana in terms of its
                    national interest, I guess you'd say, also has to be looked at (what am I trying
                    to say here?) within the context of where Botswana is and what Botswana, in a
                    sense, was trying to do. As Botswana as an African nation, as a member of the
                    Organization of African States, and so on vis-a-vis these particular, at that
                    time, and some still existing today, difficult situations. In other words,
                    meaningful independence in Rhodesia with participation by all of its people, the
                    Angola situation, the Namibian situation, and, of course, the situation in South
                    Africa. I don't know whether that's clear enough. But what I'm trying to say, I
                    guess, is that if Botswana existed alone, which of course it does not do, our
                    relationship to it and our policy toward it were proper and from a development
                    standpoint, supportive. But as I said, Botswana does not exist in isolation. It
                    is a part of Africa; it is a part of southern Africa, more immediate, and they
                    certainly ... let's say that the U.S. policies, whatever they may have been, did
                    not coincide with the ideas of how the Botswanans thought we should be
                    exercising our presence or influence in the area. I imagine that still reigns
                    true today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of U.S. policy towards Swaziland and Lesotho,
                        would you say that basically the same applied, or are there
                        differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I mean basically the same applies. Significant differences are not
                    apparent, or were not apparent at that time. All three of the countries are
                    different, very different, in their governments, people and everything else. I'm
                    certain ... not certain, no, but ... and maybe I'm influenced by where I 1ived
                    and so on ... but it's much easier, let us say, to have a positive base in a
                    context where you feel that the country has potential, has a meaningful future,
                    and where the leadership, the officials, etc. are dedicated to fulfilling that
                    future. You can relate more positively. Speaking purely in abstraction, if you
                    were in a situation where the problems seemingly are intractable and there is a
                    deficit in physical and human resource terms to cope with these problems, you
                    might, as a part of your presence, do the best that you can. But at the same
                    time, while doing the best, you might say that your best will never be good
                    enough; their best would never be good enough; and therefore, it's very
                    difficult to ... it's a little difficult to put as positive a face on what you
                    do or to go at it with a certain kind of enthusiasm.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>There's also another factor which is not an intangible factor — it's a real
                    factor — it is your apperception or one's apperception or a group's apperception
                    of how vigorous or how dedicated a particular regime or government or people
                    might be in pursuing their own betterment economically and politically, speaking
                    in strictly abstract terms. You are influenced by your environment, and that
                    environment, which is made up of many factors, really conditions how you respond
                    to a particular situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us some concrete examples of the things
                        you're saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I was purposely speaking in a kind of abstract way ... but let's
                    say, if you are a member of the underclass — and this would apply in any
                    situation — and someone comes along with an affirmative action program, or
                    whatever the case might be, or open enrollment or whatever, it's not very
                    meaningful because you do not have the assets which enable you to take advantage
                    of an affirmative action opportunity or an open enrollment or whatever the case
                    might be, and when you say the assets, you're talking in concrete terms. You
                    have to talk in terms of leadership; you have to talk in terms of resources and
                    all the rest. Therefore, you relate, I think, sometimes unconsciously or
                    consciously, or just humanly so, to different situations in terms of chances for
                    the meaningful employment of resources of whatever kind and whatever type in
                    concert with other resources and with other people, and so forth. You are
                    influenced by where you are and the environmental context in which you are
                    functioning. And if that is not negative in a sense ... if that is negative, and
                    it can be negative in many different kinds of ways, then this does affect how
                    institutionally or individually or groupwise one relates to that particular
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked a few minutes ago about the great differences
                        between the peoples and the governments of those three countries. Could you
                        elaborate on that a little before we proceed to the next main question? How
                        were they different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, we had a monarchy in Lesotho; we had a monarchy in Swaziland; and
                    there's an old saying the king should reign but not rule. That may have been
                    more the case in Lesotho, but the opposite of that is the fact in Swaziland. And
                    that determines, I guess you'd say, in the case of Swaziland, how people relate,
                    how the government relates. Swaziland, you might say, functions in a kind of way
                    as a national ... as a tribal nation with the king at the head, the apex of his
                    tribe. And even though you at one time did have a parliament which ceased to
                    function at one point in Swaziland ... what can I say ... let's see — it gave a
                    different characterization to the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NELSON: In terms of its modernity, in terms of how government related to people
                    and how people in a sense functioned within a governmental context, because it
                    was a tribal context. This was not the case in Lesotho. We had a parliament and
                    a prime minister. And I think you would have to say that there the prime
                    minister was a very strong force and his party was a relatively strong force,
                    but there were difficulties as well.</p>
                <p>In Botswana I think you had outstanding leadership. You had a functioning
                    parliamentary body, you had functioning political parties, and it was a
                    different atmosphere in the sense that there was ... even though it was a
                    multi-party system ... there was a kind of oneness and quite possibly a sense of
                    real momentum and progress in which government and people were participating
                    fully and effectively. This is not to say that there isn't a good economy, or
                    wasn't a good economy in Swaziland. It's a different kind of economy, not a ...
                    In a tribal or family environment, there definitely is a head and you might say
                    that when decisions are made, that decisions are made, or when actions are taken
                    (or however you might wish to characterize it), they might be taken in a
                    headlike or ... in other words, paternal ... and if the father says this is what
                    we do then that's what is done and maybe you don't like it, or whatever the case
                    may be, but you do it, and it's more edict and less participatory. Those kinds
                    of differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the political climate in Botswana when
                        you went there as the first American Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Political climate within Botswana? I think in a real sense that there was
                    a very positive political climate. Very positive in the sense that ... this is
                    repetitious ... but there was effective leadership; political parties were well
                    organized; the major party functioned effectively; they governed effectively —
                    it was a parliamentary system, of course. The elections were contested, and
                    contested in a good way, although it was somewhat difficult sometimes to find
                    real meaningful differences between candidates or contestants. And we're no
                    strangers to that even here in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The parliament was vigorous. I used to attend parliamentary sessions and there
                    was good participation, good debate. And while civil service is not political in
                    pure terms, you had a government that was well managed and, of course, an
                    effective management beneath your ministers, deputy ministers, etc., vice
                    ministers, or whatever the case might be. An effective administrate-managerial
                    cadre, although it wasn't a very deep cadre, deep in terms of numbers, gave
                    meaning to and was able to implement the policies and the political direction or
                    aims of the government or as they were set out by the political leadership or
                    the party. And even though you had ... not even though — that's the wrong way to
                    put it ... but ... while there were at least three parties existing, you had the
                    feeling that regardless of their party differences, that this was a political
                    system that has as its orientation the imperative that Botswana should progress
                    and that in achieving this progress that it should be done in a participatory
                    manner and that all should ... all its people ... should benefit from this
                    progress. For example, the President's tribe was the Bamangwato tribe, and some
                    of the very significant mineral resources in Botswana were on Bamangwato land,
                    tribal land. And we would assume in theory that it would be possible for this
                    resource, in a sense, and the fruits of this resource, to reside solely with the
                    Bamangwato people in the concept of tribal land. But that was not the case and
                    there was never any question, I would say, that even though it was in this
                    tribal area that this resource existed, despite that, that resource was to
                    benefit all Botswanans. So I think, you know, the feeling that one received was
                    that yes, we had political parties, we contest with each other, overall
                    participants, we're all Botswanans, and Botswana and Botswana's well being is
                    dominant, and the benefits of Botswana, be they intrinsic benefits or material
                    benefits, should flow to all of its citizens.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I think the Botswanans were pleased to have the first American
                    Ambassador resident in their country. I never had any question, once I became
                    knowledgeable, of acceptance. There wasn't a large foreign representation in
                    terms of diplomatic missions in Botswana, but I'd been told, and I guess I'd
                    have to say, modesty aside 1 suppose, that the President and others felt that in
                    terms of the diplomatic representation in Botswana that our representation was
                    number one, I suppose ... and I'm not talking about the United States, but about
                    the manner in which we were able to relate to the President, his family and the
                    other officials and the people of Botswana. I still have, and treasure very
                    deeply, relationships with Botswanans today. I felt also that while I had a very
                    proper and open official relationship with the President, that we also had a
                    personal relationship which was equally open and equally rewarding. But at the
                    same time, one did not intrude upon the other, because in your official
                    relationship, there are times when you have to relate in a way which may not ...
                    or you have to present issues or questions or whatever where the official
                    position of Botswana is contrary to the official position of the United States
                    nationally or in the U.N., or whatever the case might be. But that ... those
                    kinds of official differences of view really never got in the way of a positive
                    relationship, both officially and personally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you perceived by the governments of Lesotho and
                        Swaziland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think for observance there was the fact that I was not a resident in
                    either of the countries. There was ... the only terms I could think of is
                    distance, but the distance was there geographically, but you did not have the
                    continuing, almost daily, official and social association. Therefore ... I
                    didn't want to say closeness, or whether it was even conceived that when you're
                    an official from a government relating to the officials of another government
                    that there should be closeness. I don't know — but that ... it was not the same
                    as it was in Botswana.</p>
                <p>In the times that I was present in the country, we had a free and easy
                    relationship with King Moshoeshoe, at least in ... I think. I used to visit the
                    ministers and some civil servants and the prime minister when I was in the
                    country, and at virtually all times, regardless of the situation or the
                    individuals involved, we were capable of relating effectively to one another. I
                    think that's about all I can talk about Lesotho.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Swaziland ... King Sobhuza is the oldest reigning monarch in the world actually
                    and whatever you might say, he is a tremendous presence and a person who I think
                    sincerely wants the best for his people. I remember when I went to present my
                    credentials to the king, and, of course, he was in his national dress, his
                    ministers there in striped trousers and cutaway coats, and I walked in and I was
                    presented to him and he said, “Oh, I thought you were just another Swazi,” or
                    something like that. I think he is a tremendous individual, a tremendous person
                    and I think a wise person who has led Swaziland effectively and in the direction
                    which in his terms is the best for Swaziland. Where outsiders are concerned, I
                    think quite possibly the king is more remote than maybe King Moshoeshoe, who, of
                    course, is a much younger person. The king's officials and his ministers, and so
                    on, that I had contact with were receptive, understanding, and so on.I have a
                    great admiration for the people of Lesotho and I think we have some very good
                    friends there as well. It was a country that you could have nothing but
                    admiration for and particularly in terms of their people. It's a country where
                    you have very high literacy. Its university which then became part of the
                    University for Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, was first called Pope Pius XII
                    University, actually. And the people are very well trained and have high skills.
                    Population ... the Lesotho women are fully participant and a very dominant
                    factor in their society. I guess it's the way that countries are, in a sense,
                    endowed. Lesotho's endowment is quite meager, but its endowment, in a sense, is
                    in its people. And this strikes one. And, of course, the Lesothos are involved
                    in this country and they say something about people who come out of a situation
                    where they live on the hills and so on.</p>
                <p>Swaziland is ... because of its ... as I've indicated before, kind of tribal
                    situation where it's a large family and with the king as the head. The members
                    of that tribal nation in a sense ... you get a different ... another kind of
                    relationship. I don't know how to characterize it quite frankly. And, of course,
                    I've said enough about Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you. One of the questions we always ask our
                        ambassadors is how you were perceived by the country of your post, but then
                        we also try to ask how you were perceived by your peers, and when we ask
                        that question we are talking about other United States ambassadors. Some of
                        the earlier black ambassadors indicated that occasionally they found
                        themselves being introduced to people and the individuals would say, “Oh
                        fine, how do you like our country?” And they would have some difficulty
                        understanding that there were black United States ambassadors. Had that
                        changed by the time you became an ambassador in '71, or did you have any
                        difficulties at all, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I remember once when I was ... we were in Ethiopia ... I was not an
                    ambassador then but I was Deputy Director of AID Mission to Ethiopia. I was
                    complimented by an Embassy staffer on the fact that I spoke good English. Within
                    the southern African context, we did have Chiefs of Mission meetings and things
                    of that kind, and, of course, they knew who you were and you were treated
                    correctly and accepted by them. I would also say this: that I think it's still
                    true that the old school tie sort of thing ... I always said I was in the State
                    Department as an ambassador, but it's also true I wasn't of the State Department
                    ... you understand my distinction. You can be in a group; at the same time
                    you're not part of that group. So I was in the State Department, I can say, not
                    through my own efforts, but in a sense I didn't spring from the State Department
                    and then therefore I wasn't of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What difference did that make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I think there are real differences. You're a relative but you're
                    not really part of the inner family. And that ... you know there's a formal ...
                    in all organizations there's a formal structure and there's an informal
                    structure. You can probably participate effectively in the formal sense, but in
                    the informal sense where things probably are accomplished with greater ease or
                    more effectively, you're not a part of that structure since you aren't really
                    born to it, you would say. The persons that I ... the ambassadors that I've
                    associated with in southern Africa, some were political, some were career. And,
                    of course, your staffs are all career persons and their objective, I guess, and
                    the objective of most Foreign Service officers is that they want the
                    achievement, the career achievement that they seek is to be an ambassador. And
                    in a sense, here is an outsider who is fulfilling that role, or is in that role,
                    and he doesn't spring, or he or she doesn't spring from their group. Therefore,
                    you really don't know their tribal ways, we'll say, and sometimes it's
                    sufferance, sometimes it's acceptance, and sometimes it falls in between. I'm
                    talking not just about other ambassadors ... I'm talking about other Foreign
                    Service people with whom you would be most associated.</p>
                <p>So in the formal sense, you're recognized; people rise when you enter the room,
                    and all the rest of it. You have to leave before they can leave ... and all
                    these little niceties or protocolish kinds of customs are followed and in some
                    instances, in good spirit and with no distinction, and in other instances, with
                    not too good a spirit and with some differences. That may be less so today but I
                    think the Foreign Service of the United States is still a relatively tightly
                    held group which rejects those who are not, in a sense, to the manor born. I
                    think that's diminishing but elitism is there and all the kinds of things which
                    derive ... or which flow from a kind of elitist environment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Across the board. Let's talk about a typical day in the
                        life of an ambassador in Botswana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh, a typical day? Well, you go to the office and you read, you read, you
                    read, you read a great deal of correspondence, a great deal of cable traffic and
                    if you want to really be knowledgeable, you do have to immerse yourself in all
                    the things which relate to your country of assignment, and to ... as well as to
                    ... I want to say exogenous kinds of factors which influence, or have an
                    influence upon your country of assignment. So therefore there is, I think,
                    considerable continuing keeping abreast of events, issues, questions, positions,
                    policy representations and all the rest. Then, of course, you have staff
                    supervision. You try to, without wearing out your welcome, keep a relationship
                    going with particular functionaries of the government. I always like to visit
                    about the countryside as much as possible because you don't know a country by
                    residing continuously in the capital city. You have the question of looking at
                    the function of other U.S. programs and function of other U.S. personnel, say
                    economic assistance programs, or Peace Corps or whatever the case might be. We
                    worked almost continuously in terms of building up our U.S. library with an
                    interest in bringing others to the country, people like Nikki Giovanni, at one
                    time, and others in terms of activities. The other question of trying to achieve
                    a means whereby officials of the country can visit the United States under one
                    auspices of another.</p>
                <p>When I was in Botswana there was participation by American companies in
                    exploitation of mineral resources in Botswana. And while you were interested in
                    and sought private ... positive private participation in enterprise in Botswana,
                    you also ... well, I was concerned that Botswana be represented effectively in
                    any negotiations or whatever that might go on. Because having concern that
                    Botswanans were protecting their own interests meant, I think, that there would
                    be a mutual, beneficial enterprise arising. If it was exploitative, then it was
                    not, in the long term, or even in the near term, really beneficial or truly
                    beneficial.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Therefore, I remember working with a Ford Foundation representative in Botswana.
                    I'd known him in Tanzania. We were both there. We ... I couldn't do it but his
                    offices could do it — effected a means whereby Botswana had available to it
                    legal talent, outside legal talent, that could work with their own trained
                    lawyers in making certain that negotiations, or how you might wish to
                    characterize it, were equal around the table. As you will find that even though
                    large corporations have their own legal staffs, when they go into these types of
                    negotiations, enterprise development, they hire the best New York law firms
                    possible, and therefore while the government has its attorneys general and other
                    legal persons, but it is important that the government avail itself of other
                    legal resources or expertise or engineering expertise or whatever the case might
                    be. This is one of the things that I was concerned about and others were
                    concerned about. And in a sense, while this isn't ... some people would say it's
                    not directly a responsibility, I think it is still very true that while we
                    encourage participation of American private concerns in other countries, we have
                    to be concerned, if that participation is going to be fruitful, that there be
                    equality in terms of any arrangements that ... might be arrived at. It's one
                    thing to encourage the participation, but it's another thing — and you can stop
                    there — I think that there's an extra step that needs to be taken, whether this
                    is in the job description or not, to make certain that the interests of all
                    parties are served and served well, because if it goes the other way, it's only
                    going to be a wound which will have to be healed.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NELSON: Lesotho. .When I was there on my visits (I'll call them short stays) I
                    usually traveled and looked at various undertakings, particularly on the
                    development side, where we were engaged in working with the government. Well, I
                    think this is not particular to Lesotho. I think it's probably particular to all
                    countries in Africa, but we're speaking about Lesotho. In my view, the
                    overriding question in Lesotho was development. How was Lesotho, a country which
                    is of a limited endowment, as I said before — they did have diamonds at one time
                    — surrounded, an island within the Republic of South Africa, a mountainous
                    country which is plagued by erosion, soil erosion, practically all the topsoil
                    in Lesotho has flowed down into South Africa, how a country which has as its
                    primary enterprise the export of labor with a considerable portion of its male
                    population absent from the country for a significant period of time, how was a
                    country such as Lesotho going to develop and develop in a meaningful way? To me,
                    this, as I say, was the overriding issue and it was a concern which coincided
                    with my background in development work, and I think it was a concern of the
                    Lesotho people or the Lesotho Government to determine and foster the kind of
                    economic and social development activity which would enhance national
                    well-being. Therefore, when I was in Lesotho, I spent a great deal of time with
                    people of the various “action ministries,” and in traveling about the country
                    looking at activities that we were engaged in with the government which were
                    developmental in nature. There were also questions from time to time in terms of
                    food, the bringing in of PL-480 commodities from the United States, and working
                    with our AID people — the economic assistance people — in attempting to see,
                    within the resources available to us, how we could become purposeful
                    participants in development activity. Also, I attempted to talk with the Prime
                    Minister on each occasion I was there to get some feel for his concerns,
                    direction, and I even used to make a number of visits with him to activities
                    that we had assisted, or activities which his government was undertaking with
                    their own resources. We looked at, as well, participation in Lesotho by other
                    governments or other concerns. There was some participation, for example, there
                    was a Holiday Inn, the southern African branch of Holiday Inns in Lesotho. There
                    was participation by other groups dominant in South African concerns. And the
                    idea, of course, is to get some appreciation of how this mix of activities was
                    progressing and the kinds of contributions, positive or negative contributions
                    that they might be making to Lesotho.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Also, it was important to speak to members and converse with the members of
                    Parliament and I think we had one meeting which was rather interesting because
                    this was the day with Mokhehle, who was really an opposite in personality in
                    Lesotho and who eventually fled the country. And I remember on one of my visits
                    there, for the first time in a number of years, he came into the Embassy and we
                    sat down and we talked. He had been angry — concerned because he had felt that
                    Peace Corps volunteers had involved themselves politically. There was a time
                    when the Peace Corps did not function in Lesotho and the Peace Corps at the
                    particular time we talked ... was in Lesotho. And we talked about that a little
                    bit, and of course, he said then, of course, that he did not object to Peace
                    Corps volunteers if ... they were artisans, or they did practical things, but he
                    didn't like “A.B. generalists,” which was one of the things he was somewhat
                    prejudiced about, that you could take a person with an A.B. degree from the
                    United States and just because it is developed think that they could make a
                    contribution in some developing countries, which is not exactly the way it was
                    put, but there was a great surge at one time to recruit A.B. generalists and
                    that A.B. generalist could then be given skills which would enable them to
                    contribute to the development of a country or to participate effectively and
                    work effectively in other countries.</p>
                <p>So it was this kind of mix, I suppose, meeting with ministers, civil servants,
                    politicians in and out of government, business people, and going about the
                    countryside to get an appreciation of the problem on one hand, and the kind of
                    response which the international community, the U.N. and other donor agencies
                    there in Lesotho, the kind of response which was ... of which America, the
                    United States was a part, which was being mounted to cope with the development
                    issue, economic issues, and social issues in Lesotho. The dominant thing was
                    that here is a nation which, as I said, exported manpower, which has an effect
                    on the social fabric of the country, and what can you do with ... in an economic
                    sense, or development sense, recognizing the depletion, depleted land mass and
                    all the rest of it, to bring about the kinds of activities which could
                    substitute for having to work in the mines in South Africa. So in general that's
                    more or less how I responded in the Lesotho situation — but, of course, there
                    are always cocktail parties and things of that kind (laughter).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of programs really can substitute for that kind
                        of situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Agricultural development? Lesotho has to feed itself. I think it's
                    probably true to say that Lesotho is not capable of feeding itself from its own
                    resources ... from its own agricultural resources at this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it ever be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>NELSON: Quite possibly it could. And there is a real need to institute the kinds
                    of conservation practices which will halt, if not ... or at least slow down, the
                    tremendous erosion that takes place in that country. There's a possibility of a
                    small industrial enterprise. The Lesotho weavers, they're quite good
                    craftspeople. Tourism, which is one thing the government was quite interested in
                    ... in other words, viable economic activity. I would say basically
                    labor-intensive in character (can't say everything is capital-intensive) that
                    would employ significant numbers of people and which would permit them to earn a
                    livelihood which would obviate the necessity, as I say, to work in the mines of
                    South Africa. That's no easy task because again, the wages which the workers in
                    South Africa repatriated to Lesotho — and Lesotho also had the rand in currency
                    at that time — was one of the most significant earnings, or resource earnings
                    which the government has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your concerns in Swaziland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, to me Swaziland is a very attractive country, a beautiful country,
                    and has asbestos ... there's a very significant mine, the Havelock Mine, which
                    mines asbestos and an iron ore mine which was played out. The difficulty of
                    processing the ore was such that it was not economically feasible, or becoming
                    less feasible, plus the mine ... resources being depleted. They had a wood pulp
                    factory. These were foreign-owned enterprises, of course. And basically it's an
                    agricultural country: tree crops and also ground crops, cereals. And while I
                    can't go into it at length, the rather difficult tenure system in that all the
                    land, I believe this is correct, was tribally held. And here the questions arise
                    in terms of a person's ability to farm land, to enclose land and also some
                    questions of incentive if the land isn't owned, and I think some questions arise
                    about our main activity in the agricultural field.</p>
                <p>Tourism was another activity in Swaziland, but beneath all of this, from the
                    economic activity that was going forth in Swaziland and the other activity that
                    could be encouraged or supported — that the resources that were generated from
                    such activity flowed more directly to the Swazi people. In other words, it
                    wasn't or would not be exploitative, I guess you'd say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that the main, perhaps, the main activity that
                        you were involved in was in the agricultural area. Could you give us some
                        examples of the kinds of things you were involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well, the U.S. Government, the economic assistance program, was working
                    with, I think, the U.K. and certain other donors, and the U.N., also, in terms
                    of practices, cultural practices, and cultural innovations. I think you could
                    say, better care of the land, better use of the land, protection of the land in
                    terms of erosion and things of this kind, the demarcation of land in terms of
                    one or more crops as over against cattle or other animals. This was a problem
                    that we were working on and we brought in heavy equipment and certain other
                    things with which to bring land into cultivation and attempting to erect a means
                    whereby land that was brought into cultivation could be shared out by farmers.
                    We also were doing some work in health but not in education per se. We had some
                    people in the agricultural wing of the University of Botswana, Lesotho and
                    Swaziland, which is no longer existent in that form. It was in Swaziland we were
                    providing some faculty staff to the agricultural segment of the University.</p>
                <p>Swaziland also had a Holiday Inn. In fact, all three countries did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The agricultural activity that you were involved in in
                        Swaziland, was any of that same kind of thing going on in Lesotho?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of trying to ... the soil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, there was, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of your work in Botswana, what would you consider to have
                        been your most, I wouldn't say outstanding achievements, but which of your
                        accomplishments there do you feel happiest about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>NELSON: Speaking in general terms, which is about the best way I can approach
                    this question, I think I can say that we became very affirmative participants in
                    development in Botswana. There were, in taking the region as a whole, because
                    that was how the AID program was structured at that time. I can't give you a
                    precise number but there was in a real sense, I would say, a quantum jump in
                    U.S. participation in terms of ... in development activity, and a significant
                    portion of this quantum was in Botswana, and I think represented a significant
                    contribution in terms of resource flows to development activity in the country.
                    And again, I think, somewhat repetitiously, as newly independent countries, or
                    in Botswana as a newly independent country, its primary concern was a
                    development concern, a concern for positive exploitation of its resources in
                    order to meet economic and other demands. And I believe quite firmly that these
                    kinds of considerations, development considerations, far outweigh strictly
                    political considerations. If a country is progressing and if people's lives are
                    better and they can see improvement, in a whole variety of factors or areas,
                    then if you're concerned about stability, this is the best way to assure it. If
                    you're concerned about a country's ability to participate meaningfully in the
                    area or in the world at large, this is a way to assure it. Development ... these
                    are countries that became independent ... these are countries that were
                    liberated, development is liberation, development reinforces liberation,
                    reinforces independence. I think, you know, you cannot gainsay the fact that in
                    terms of U.S. interests, Lesotho, for example, or Botswana or Swaziland, doesn't
                    rank very high on the scale of things the way our world is oriented — East,
                    West, and all the rest of it. But there is also, I think, an ethical or moral
                    commitment of a kind where if we are participating and if we want to have an
                    effective relationship with country A or country B for whatever reason or
                    whatever purpose, then the thing which can make that relationship significant is
                    to contribute in those areas where national needs are recognized and where a
                    contribution will be of some significance in affirming the independence which
                    that country has achieved. And that in doing so, you foster a relationship which
                    is more enduring and which enables the relationship to be one of ... more mutual
                    in nature ... What I'm trying to say, I guess, is that while the countries may
                    not be equal in terms of wealth or whatever the case might be, but if a country
                    is secure in its own right and you're participating in their achieving that
                    sense of security, then the relationship that you have becomes more equal and
                    becomes more positive, even supportive, because it isn't a relationship of weak
                    to strong; it's a relationship of a country which is strong in its own right.
                    That's a little awkward, but I think, you know, if an individual feels that he
                    is progressing, his outlook or relationship with others, etc. takes on a
                    different character than if he feels he is stalemated, depressed or whatever. He
                    can't relate positively, in his environment or with others. (Inaudible) and
                    probably the personalities, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True. As ambassador to these three countries, in what area
                        or what areas were you most disappointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I would have liked to have done more during the time I was there in
                    contributing to their progress, and again, this is couched in development terms
                    and not to a national factor. Because it affects them and maybe it wasn't even
                    feasible, but one would have liked to have seen more positive movement in the
                    region in terms of some of the issues and problems which exist today, in a kind
                    of way that is outside of Botswana, but the picture that we draw is that here
                    are Botswana and the other countries as well with the various large and strong
                    country of South Africa, controlling access both externally and internally.
                    There was then the Rhodesian question, the Angola question, and the Namibian
                    question, and all of these issues and problems affect these countries and affect
                    them quite deeply. Not that they would be irresponsible, but their actions in
                    many ways are conditioned by the fact that access to the outside world must flow
                    through South Africa or access of the outside world to them must in a sense flow
                    in such a direction. The only thing (inaudible) if there was some means by which
                    we could have built a bridge from Botswana to Zambia, for example, these kinds
                    of things will come in time, but these countries need alternatives and
                    alternatives significantly in terms of transport and...</p>
                <p>For example, when I was in Botswana, there was a meat crisis, I guess you'd say,
                    in Zambia, and through some arrangements with a government undertaking ...
                    arrangements which were helpful, I guess we'd say, in facilitating in the ...
                    using Alaskan Airlines, if I'm not mistaken, flying meat into Zambia, because
                    Zambia was deficit in corn, in maize or corn, deficit in meat and the Botswanan
                    Government was airlifting meat to Zambia using these airplanes. I think that had
                    a significant effect because it is the relationship between Botswana and the
                    mass land of Africa and also people can become somewhat restive if they're
                    hungry. So what I'm just trying to say is that I think more can be done in
                    providing alternatives to countries such as Swaziland, or Botswana in
                    particular. Very difficult in terms of Lesotho. But these kinds of really viable
                    alternatives at that time and even to a great extent now, are dependent upon
                    other situations and other problems which need addressing.</p>
                <p>We did some roadwork in Botswana and improved internal communications, opening up
                    areas, and we were in a sense right up to the river which this ferry crosses for
                    about a ten to fifteen minute ferry ride ... It could have been great. Instead
                    of having a ferry link we could have had, in a sense, a land link ... certainly
                    wasn't politically feasible then and probably isn't quite feasible now. But
                    transportation is, I think, a very key consideration in this area, and it's one
                    where I would have liked to have seen, if possible, greater progress during the
                    time that I was there, admittedly that such progress needs to be linked to the
                    solutions of issues and other questions.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NELSON: Oh, he's dead now, but I used to admire Seretse Khama and Lady Khama, and
                    I think it was an opportunity, in a sense privilege, to have that kind of
                    association, not only with the Khamas and their family but the other people of
                    Botswana. I think that this is probably the significant thing in any tenure in a
                    country situation. You don't bring away material things. Sure we all collect
                    souvenirs, artifacts of one kind or another, but it's the intangibles that count
                    and it's like the satisfaction is mostly psychic because you take satisfaction
                    out of other people's achievements and things which you think are meaningful or
                    important. But to me the thing that you take away which is probably ... gives
                    you the greatest memory is an association or the association with people from
                    other countries, from other places, from other cultures, from other traditions.
                    And the fact that you could bridge all these differences and come upon something
                    which you have in common and erect a friendship or relationship which
                    contributed to your own development and your own sense of well-being towards
                    people ... associations with people. All that kind of means much to you in a

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NELSON: This doesn't mean to imply that I did everything properly, but I really
                    can't think of anything at this particular time, at this juncture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lesotho.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think quite possibly I should have spent more time in Lesotho; the same
                    would be true of Swaziland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you have had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: In my view, I could not. Also, when you have charg�s in the countries who
                    revert to the position of deputy chiefs of mission when you're present, it
                    materially affects their pay for one thing. And also I think there's a balance
                    that has to be struck, unless you're talking strictly in embassy terms. That
                    person who is the charg� has to feel that he has the kind of dominant
                    responsibility and you know, if you're dropping in every other week or every two
                    weeks or whatever the case might be, I think you intrude upon that sense of
                    responsibility. And also, although this is pure guess, do you negatively affect
                    his or her relationships with the peoples of that government? In other words,
                    can they look to him as the responsible ... a responsible person in terms of
                    their needs or requirements or whatever the case might be, or do they have to
                    look outside? So in, I guess, retrospect, although it would have been beneficial
                    to me to have spent more time in the other countries, quite possibly in the end
                    it wouldn't have been the most effective way to do business.</p>
                <p>I think the other thing, and this is strictly in bureaucratic terms, although I
                    did pursue this and possibly might have pursued it with more vigor, is the fact
                    that I think it is very important that if the ambassador is in a country that
                    the heads of the other elements of the U.S. Government, such as USIS, the AID
                    person, be resident in the country where the ambassador is resident. I'm sure
                    that the heart of the motivation in sharing out the heads of these three
                    organizations amongst the three countries was that you have this and they have
                    that, and you have this and they have that ....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that everybody has the sense of having a U.S.
                        presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NELSON: Although the U.S. presence was there anyhow. If you're going to have a
                    situation where one person as the ambassador to three countries then I think
                    that he or she should have the heads of the other agencies resident with him
                    because, as I said, it's more effective to relate face to face or personally
                    than to relate on another kind of basis of communications, or telephone, which
                    is an insecure instrument anyhow. And I did find an occasional visit ... so that
                    would have been much more preferable ... that would have been more preferable
                    for me ... and quite possibly a more effective way of directing and knitting
                    together the U.S. effort in the countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you were addressing a group of youngsters who'd
                        expressed an interest in becoming ambassadors one day, what kind of advice
                        would you give them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, probably to submerge that ambition (laughter). Ah, not in the sense
                    that it's not a job that's interesting, but I guess, and I don't know what gives
                    rise to this, it's some kind of subliminal feeling or something. It's all right
                    to have the ambition, but so much has to go before it. I think that, in my own
                    terms, I was very fortunate coming into this kind of a position in that I had
                    spent about nineteen years, let's say, involved, the preponderance of which I
                    had been resident overseas. I lived in the Far East, the Middle East and in
                    Africa, and I had an opportunity to work with other people, to work with other
                    governments, to become vitally concerned with how the U.S. relates through its
                    activities to other governments, to other people. The kinds of possibilities and
                    programs or potential which the United States has to ... at its reach to
                    function cooperatively with other governments. And I've had the ... (and this I
                    think is quite crucial) the experience, we'll say, of working with people of
                    various cultures, with officials, with presidential leaders, or whatever the
                    case might be. And that this kind of experience stood me in very good stead, I
                    think, and was good preparation and good background for serving as an ambassador
                    to these countries. If I had been taken from some other occupation, such as
                    school teacher, or strictly within the U.S. context, it would have taken me
                    much, much longer to gain the kind of insights, we'll say, which enables one to
                    hopefully perform effectively in another country, in another cultural situation,
                    so I think in that sense I was very fortunate.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I guess if I was talking to some young person who had this as a goal, and having
                    that as a goal he would probably be interested in the Foreign Service or at
                    least some branch of international activity, governmental international
                    activity, and he or she was in a preparative stage, I think academically I would
                    suggest or urge that they become steeped in history or some specialization, of
                    course, knowledgeable of a language, to know something about economics,
                    something about administration, political science, all these things which they
                    sort of group under international relations these days. To have some
                    anthropological insights, and maybe I'm prejudiced, but I do think that Peace
                    Corps experiences are very meaningful ones for people to have, young people I
                    guess you'd have to say here, because it does, providing the person is so
                    inclined, permit one to function in another environment without too much of the
                    trappings or labeling of U.S. Government or whatever. Not that Peace Corps
                    volunteers live off the soil, but they live at a level and in a job context or
                    work context which permits them to become very knowledgeable of other people.
                    And that's probably the greatest benefit the Peace Corps has, because still the
                    United States is very parochial; we're a very parochial people, and look at ...
                    sometime, other countries and other people, cultures as suspect. But when you
                    come down to it, there's more sameness on the part of people than in a real
                    sense the differences. These are some of the kinds of things which I would
                    suggest to someone who had this kind of ambition. And you don't have to do it
                    all through government. There are other kinds of activities or programs where
                    one can get some kind of international experience, be it business or through
                    exchange professorships or Fulbrights or whatever. Cultural shock we talk about
                    a great deal; I think cultural shock is real. It's probably not as meaningful
                    but it's real.</p>
                <p>So I guess I can sum it up by saying that I think there's a particular kind of
                    academic preparation which is ... which gives one an added advantage, and also I
                    think some involvement outside the United States, whatever form it might take
                    and regardless of the region of the country where this kind of involvement might
                    take place, builds background added to perception, or however you might wish to
                    characterize it, which would contribute to one's effectiveness in the job of a
                    diplomat.</p>
                <p>I do think that you don't get rich working for the government but I would like to
                    see more people, more American blacks become involved in international activity,
                    be it government or non-government. You gain a great deal by going outside the
                    United States and functioning and also permits you at the same time to look back
                    at the United States, and you can't do that too easily here in the United
                    States. But if we're to be truly representative, pluralism and all that sort of
                    thing we talk about, then I think it's sort of mandated that our representation
                    at all levels outside our national boundaries fully reflect our own society. To
                    that end I think that the American black is distinctly under-represented in
                    international activity or life. And certainly Africa isn't the only region in
                    the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you enjoyed ... well, let's see, do you think
                        you had any special hardships or problems because of your blackness as an
                        ambassador, I mean, and particularly to those three countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No. I do not believe ... you're an American regardless of whether that's
                    my fault or not, and that to me is the way that you're first perceived.
                    Blackness doesn't get, in my strong view, does not have to be a plus in an
                    African situation and does not have to be a minus or a negative. I think it's
                    very important that you relate as a representative, whatever you may represent,
                    on the basis of your own self. And it should be no different than if you have
                    red hair or blonde hair, or whatever the case might be, or blue eyes, green
                    eyes, or brown eyes; that's the ideal of course. People in other countries are
                    truly cognizant of our society and they're truly cognizant of the problems which
                    reside in it. But when you, in the first instance, you are a representative of
                    the President, you're a representative of the United States, and that is what
                    clothes you when you go to a country, black or whatever. And my impression is
                    that is how you're looked at and that's initially. What follows is predominantly
                    on the basis of how well you fulfill that function, how well you relate, your
                    ability to interact, your perception and presence, and all that. In very plain
                    terms, if you're a dummy, it doesn't make any difference what you look like.
                    Whiteness won't help you; blackness won't help you. Well, I think if you can
                    carry water on both shoulders, they'll say fine. I have seen this in other
                    situations. I think people who attempt to take a characteristic and use that as
                    a crutch or means to fulfillment or achievement or whatever the case might be,
                    are soon found out, and I think the persons or whatever, whoever, this is being
                    used in that way resent it. The same old thing — if you're patronizing some
                    individual, you may think you're ingratiating, but the person knows when he's
                    being patronized. Therefore, if you use the characteristic or symbol of
                    blackness to make your way, then others might not think that works and it's not
                    something you can ride upon. There was a fellow who went with the Peace Corps
                    over to Nigeria as Peace Corps Rep, and he was very surprised one day when he
                    was in a barbershop or someplace and he was called a European. He didn't look
                    like a European, but in foreign terms, a European doesn't mean a person who's
                    white particularly; it means a person who is a stranger, who is a foreigner, so
                    I think that's the way we are regarded; we are American. It isn't a detriment or
                    any negative faith. It's more in terms of other Americans than in terms of other
                    nationals. Because all Americans carry their baggage, cultural baggage, with
                    them. They don't deposit it at the Customs as they leave JFK or whatever the
                    case may be.</p>

                <p>Ambassador Nelson, this morning we talked about your years as ambassador to those
                    three countries and perhaps later on we shall back up and add a bit more to
                    that, but at this session we'd like to focus on you, the individual, your early
                    years really beginning with your birth in Michigan.</p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, a small town in the east
                    southern part of the state. I attended elementary school in Battle Creek and
                    junior high school and high school, completing high school in 1938. I went after
                    graduation to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where I graduated in 1942
                    having majored in political science and economics. Almost immediately after
                    graduation I was drafted in the Army, spent some weeks at Fort Custer in
                    Michigan, near Battle Creek; then subsequently went to Fort McClelland, Alabama
                    for basic training, and after basic training I went to Fort Hood in Texas, where
                    I attended the Officer Candidate School-Tank Service. I went overseas in 1943
                    and in Europe — primarily just to the U.K., then to France, Germany, Austria,
                    returning back to the United States in 1947. On my return from the Army I went
                    to New York University, where I attended the Graduate School for Public Service,
                    got a master's degree, and completed my work for a doctorate, but before I could
                    complete all the requirements beyond the academic requirements, it was
                    necessary, of course, to go to work, because in 1947 after the war I was married
                    to the former Maureen Tinsley of Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NELSON: My parents, Schuyler Adam Nelson and Daisey B. Nelson were from Bowling
                    Green in Kentucky ... had a small business in Battle Creek and my mother was a
                    nurse at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Battle Creek is noted for, or was noted
                    for its sanitarium, which was run by one of the Kellogg brothers, John Harvey
                    Kellogg, and, of course, Kellogg Cereals, which was his brother, W. K. Kellogg.
                    I have two brothers, two older brothers who are both in California at this
                    juncture, one in northern California and one in southern California, Los
                    Angeles. I would think that my life in Battle Creek was relatively uneventful. I
                    do remember at one time I was interested in the sciences and in medicine and one
                    of our former senators who heard me give a presentation in class offered a
                    scholarship if I would wish to go to medical school. But that was a direction
                    which I did not take.</p>
                <p>After graduate school in New York I went to work for the New York State
                    Commission on Coordination of State Activities, which was in a sense an
                    executive/legislative commission headed up by the chairman of the Senate Finance
                    Committee in New York. The Commission was in a sense a little Hoover-type
                    commission which was concerned with the organization, management and efficiency
                    of government departments of the State government. While there I worked on the
                    Department of Education and also on the Civil Service Department doing
                    analytical studies of management policies and writing up reports and
                    recommendations for these two departments. The head of the commission, after my
                    first year there, was the head of the graduate school that I attended at New
                    York University, William Ronan, actually. I stayed with the Commission until
                    1952 because in a sense there wasn't too much future in working for that
                    particular commission. I should also say I guess that the first year I worked in
                    Albany, I commuted between Albany and New York City because, like young people,
                    we felt we couldn't leave New York City. Now we realize we couldn't live in New
                    York City. Then we lived in a place called Clinton Heights, in a sense a suburb
                    of Albany and for some three ... two years.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Because of the lack of opportunity on the commission and the staff for the
                    commission, at the ... with the help of chairman, I came down to Washington, DC
                    in 1952 for a week to look about and ascertain what opportunities might be
                    available in the Federal government, and I think I was in Washington for maybe
                    two or three days, and I had an offer of a job with the Mutual Security Agency
                    as the program assistant in the Philippines. I came back to New York and talked
                    this over with some of my friends who had been in graduate school with me. I
                    happened to be in New York City at the time because we were having a commission
                    meeting and we were staying at the Hotel Pierre. Their suggestion was that the
                    offer was too low and was not commensurate in a sense with the academic training
                    and the limited work experience which I had had up to that time. So I called
                    Washington, or Washington called me (one of the two, I've forgotten now) and in
                    a sense turned down the job, but fortunately I guess, Washington came back and
                    offered me an additional grade, so I joined the Mutual Security Agency as, in
                    those days, a Foreign Service staff officer of grade 8. The original offer was
                    grade 9, which was so low that we couldn't even take an automobile overseas free
                    with the Federal government paying the transportation charges. Some years later
                    I talked to the husband of the personnel person who interviewed me and who made
                    this job offer and they were saying to me how it was that in a sense how cheaply
                    they had gotten me.</p>
                <p>But anyhow, we came to Washington for orientation and in those days the building
                    where we were actually located, which was a government building, was segregated.
                    As with Washington in 1952, during coffee breaks we couldn't even go into the
                    coffee shop and sit down, have a cup of coffee or sandwich or whatever the case
                    might be. The only place you could eat in the downtown area in those days was
                    the YWCA at 16th and K.</p>
                <p>We went to the Philippines in October of 1952 and I was very fortunate in having
                    a very good supervisor or boss or however you might wish to characterize it. I
                    was in the Public Administration Division and after ... as a program assistant
                    working on training and doing public administration jobs in the sense of
                    advising the government, which task or assignment was more or less similar to
                    the kind of work that I had done over in New York. After six months, my boss put
                    me in for and I received a 2-grade promotion, so I went from Foreign Service
                    Staff Officer Grade 8 to Foreign Service Staff Officer Grade 6. We served in the
                    Philippines for five and a half years. Also, it was very fortunate that during
                    this period, actually, almost immediately, my wife who was a psychiatric social
                    worker joined the faculty at the University of Philippines, where she was
                    responsible for organizing a school of social work and instituting a degree
                    program, master's degree program in social work at the university. This was very
                    fortunate for us in the sense that it gave us another segment of community to
                    socialize and to be friends with, the university community, as well as the
                    government community and other persons that we came to know. The fact that my
                    wife worked and that I worked made, I would think, our transition from living in
                    the United States to living overseas a smooth and easier one, because we really
                    became in a sense kind of integrated into Philippine society.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>During my service in the Philippines I worked on a number of things. I worked for
                    the President's office when Magsaysay became president, organized the
                    Presidential Complaint and Action Commission where any Philippine citizen could
                    send a telegram to the President indicating he had a grievance or a difficulty
                    or a complaint. Also, persons who lived in Manila or near Manila could come to
                    the palace in those days and come in to the Presidential Complaints and Action
                    Commission and lodge his complaint if he wished to do so. From this commission
                    and the actions the President took in treating them, a book came into being, a
                    person wrote a book called “Bare Feet in the Palace”. Ramon Magsaysay was really
                    a kind of people's president who, unfortunately, did not serve out his term,
                    having been killed in an airplane accident.</p>
                <p>I also worked again on the organization of the civil service system in the
                    Philippines, worked on the organization of the budget office and did in an
                    advisory role provide sort of organization and methods or management advisement
                    to a number of government departments.</p>
                <p>In 1955-56, my supervisor, boss, had gone to Egypt where he headed the Public
                    Administration Division there, and he called me to Cairo, and I went over a
                    period between 1955-56, where I worked as a management advisor on a
                    temporary-duty basis to the Ministry of Education. The idea was that I would ...
                    if I could work, you know, well with the Egyptian Government and there was a
                    desire for my services, I would transfer from the Philippines to Egypt. And so
                    this almost came to pass.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I returned to Manila in '56 and was prepared to transfer to Cairo when the Aswan
                    Dam situation or contretemps arose. Therefore, I did not go to Egypt; I remained
                    in the Philippines. I changed jobs at that time and became a special advisor to
                    the Mission Director for Rural Development, and subsequently became Deputy Chief
                    of the Rural Development Division. What we did in this program was to assist the
                    Philippine Government establish out of the office of the President a community
                    development program which attempted to work with rural people to create a
                    structure at the lowest level where people could come together, pool their
                    resources, and undertake development activity which they felt was needed in
                    their particular environment. These activities were, in a sense, aided by the U.
                    S. Government, and this was the President's Community Development Program. In
                    launching this program — I did a great deal of organizational work, both on the
                    Philippine side and the U.S. side — and as a part of this activity I did take a
                    number of governors and a senator and a congressman and the young man who became
                    the Presidential Assistant for Community Development to India and to Pakistan to
                    see their programs and he had a rather famous community action program which was
                    headed up at that time by S. K. Dey. I returned from India and Pakistan at this
                    time to (inaudible) and the program came into being and I stayed with that
                    program until 1958. In the meantime, the Mission Director of the Philippine
                    Mission had gone to Iran and I was called to Iran to take a look at their Rural
                    Development Program by him and subsequently we transferred to Iran, where I
                    became head of the Rural Development Program in the Mission in Iran. I worked
                    two years in Iran as head of this particular program, returning to the United
                    States in 1960. Iran at that time, of course, the Shah was in place and the
                    program that we were trying to do in concert with government was to give people,
                    in a sense rural people, more of a stake in their own being. Also as a part of
                    this process, I took the Minister of Interior, who had numerous functions to ...
                    and two of his staff people to the Philippines, to Hong Kong, to Japan, to India
                    and to Pakistan so that he could see some of the things that these other
                    governments were doing. The Minister was also a major-general in the Iranian
                    army and I think his wife told my wife that if he came back with new ideas and
                    attempted to put those ideas in force that he wouldn't be in government very
                    long. And that happened to be the case, actually.</p>
                <p>Some incidents or comment are of interest I think. In the Philippines, we visited
                    some of the local government officials, provincial governors, mayors and so on,
                    and after one sort of free-flowing session with the governor and his staff, the
                    general turned to me on our way back to the hotel saying that he felt that there
                    was maybe just a little bit too much democracy in the Philippines. In Hong Kong
                    the British police showed ... the Hong Kong police showed us, or demonstrated
                    how they dealt with riot situations. This turned up in the general's report on
                    how to deal with quarrelsome people. As a part of his function, he was also in
                    charge of the national police, local government and other things in Iran, and I
                    do believe that ... I'm certain that he really wanted to do something in his
                    country which would provide a better future for the people of Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they deal with troublesome people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NELSON: Very forcefully. The thing is that substituting quarrelsome people for
                    riots, because you're not supposed to have riots or things like that in this
                    type of Iranian regime, but I do believe that when he came back, the general
                    tried to devise his own program of 57 points. Whether he had heard of Heinz or
                    not I don't know, but ... in that country, in that administration, in that
                    government, we have to say that his approach was very forward looking. But he
                    was soon sent out of the country. He was sent to Cento as the Iranian
                    representative in Turkey. While all this ... what I'm really saying is in a
                    sense, this was a portent of the difficulties which occurred in Iran which are
                    still taking place, as a reaction to the Shah's rule.</p>
                <p>I returned to the United States in 1960 and went to Boston University for African
                    Studies and then to Oxford and to the various metropoles — Brussels, Paris, and
                    of course, London. I returned and ... after a year, I guess it was ... and
                    worked for a short time for the AID Agency as Chief of Community Development for
                    Latin America and Africa. Very fortunately, I think, a colleague of mine from
                    the Philippines was working with Sargent Shriver in terms of possibilities of
                    implementing the idea that the President had enunciated in his speech at the
                    University of Michigan about a volunteer corps. I joined a group of about six
                    people; Bill Moyers was one of them, Harris Wofford. And we worked on the
                    preparation of a report for the President on how a volunteer program would work,
                    how people would be obtained, where it would work and what kind of programs,
                    such as the programs to be worked in, and so on. Maybe as a result of this
                    report, but anyhow, the Peace Corps was created by Executive Order and
                    subsequent to its creation, I went to the Philippines to, in a sense, negotiate
                    with them on the Peace Corps and their receptivity to a Peace Corps program,
                    which they did then accept and request. Then while I was in the Philippines, I
                    was called to Nigeria to link up with Sargent Shriver to negotiate with the
                    government officials there concerning the Peace Corps program, and then I also
                    went to Ghana on my own to do the same thing. And needless to say, we had Peace
                    Corps programs established also as a result of these visits in Ghana and in
                    Nigeria.</p>
                <p>I returned to Washington and joined, in a sense, the Peace Corps as Associate
                    Director in charge of Program Development and Program Coordination. What we did
                    in a sense was develop policies by which the ... governing the Peace Corps,
                    approved programs worldwide, the budget, and we also did the congressional
                    presentation. This was to me, in a sense, a unique experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever approach a government about accepting Peace
                        Corps that refused it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All accepted. Do you know of any countries that did refuse
                        it? Or had them and....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>NELSON: No, no, I do not. No, I do not. Tanzania had Peace Corps at one time and
                    then they cut off the Peace Corps program, but the uniqueness of this experience
                    was to participate in the development of a federal program such as the Peace
                    Corps, an international program, and to be in at the creation of a particular
                    agency, and the creation of an agency stemming from some of the work that you
                    had done. We were to go overseas with the Peace Corps to Nigeria, and I did go
                    to Nigeria a second time. I only went on a temporary-duty basis to prepare the
                    way for William Saltonstall, who had been headmaster at Phillips-Exeter.</p>
                <p>I did not stay with the Peace Corps because, well, what I said to Sargent Shriver
                    was I was an FSR-2 at that time and there was $75 difference between an FSR-2
                    and FSR-1, which is the top Foreign Service rank. If you give me an FSR-1, I
                    would stay in Nigeria, but that didn't come to pass. So ... I had offers from
                    the Peace Corps ... other Peace Corps directorships in Latin America. I returned
                    to AID, where I became Director of the Office of Development Resources for a few
                    months ... for six months, after which time I recommended that the office be
                    abolished, and then became Director of North African Affairs for AID concerned
                    with Washington oversight, management and direction of aid programs in the
                    Sudan, in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and also I dealt with something
                    called the European Residuals such as the U.S.-owned currencies in Poland and
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>I stayed in Washington until 1966, when I went to Ethiopia as the Deputy Director
                    of the AID Mission there, and I spent two years in Ethiopia, from '66 to '68.
                    Then I went to Tanzania, where I became Director of the AID Mission, staying in
                    Tanzania from 1968 to 1971, and from Tanzania I left to become Ambassador to
                    Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. After the ambassadorial appointment I returned
                    to the United States and became ... and then went back overseas as Director of
                    the AID Mission in Kenya, where I stayed for four years and then retired because
                    I had the years of service, including military, etc., and of course, salaries as
                    they are today for the upper reaches of the bureaucracy are frozen. In fact,
                    today's higher graded civil servant doesn't even receive the 4.8% cost of living
                    increase that was recently voted by Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>We retired to a place in Maryland, Rossmoor, which was a leisure world retirement
                    community, and after six months we decided that was not a feasible alternative
                    and we moved back to our house in Washington in 1979. I retired in '78.
                    Incidentally, I started teaching at Howard University in International Studies,
                    although I'm by no means an academic, but in a sense I was trying to impart to
                    young people — I taught at the graduate level — some of the benefits of working
                    overseas, trying to interest them in careers and also attempting to give some
                    expos�, I guess you'd say, to development issues and development theory,
                    economic theory, and the administration of economic assistance programs from
                    many different vantage points. My experience, I think, on the whole in the U.S.
                    Government was a very satisfactory one. It did progress. We were assigned to a
                    number of countries, and the Peace Corps experience had a certain uniqueness to
                    it. And I think during this process of working in the Philippines and elsewhere,
                    I gained some insights, some appreciation for how governments in so-called
                    developing countries functioned, some problems of countries that needed to be
                    addressed, and what translates even back in the United States that while you
                    have distinctions between people in terms of attainment, or in terms of
                    well-being, that a viable situation doesn't exist where people don't have some
                    hope for a better future. And I think that's true not only in terms of
                    individual nations, but also nations vis-a-vis other nations. In other words, I
                    think it's almost a moral imperative that countries that have prospered need ...
                    in a sense, have an obligation to help those that are less fortunate, because in
                    doing so they make their own futures that much more secure.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think if there are any other things that are worth mentioning. I
                    don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a few questions from this morning's session that I
                        want to back up to that could just take a moment or so. This morning when we
                        were talking about any problems you may have had in working as an
                        ambassador, as a black ambassador, and you made the statement, you said
                        something to the effect that there is such a thing as being with an
                        organization such as the State Department and yet not being of it, or a part
                        of the establishment, I guess, so to speak, in a sense. And could you talk a
                        little more about that and the implications that would have for one being
                        able to lead a meaningful existence in that setting, or being able to have a
                        rewarding career in that kind of setting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I think the distinction we have to make here is that while I was a
                    part of the Foreign Service establishment, and the AID Agency Economic
                    Assistance Program, it was within the parameters of the State Department, it is
                    still in a sense an independent agency, in a quasi sense. And certainly a total
                    U.S. effort in any country and where the economic assistance programs are part
                    of that effort is nominally under the direction of the ambassador; the AID
                    director serves as part of the so-called country team. But the AID director has
                    separate linkages back to Washington to his own administration, and, in a sense,
                    to his own agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The State Department proper is, of course, populated by Foreign Service Officers,
                    Foreign Service Officers, who take a written examination, who take an oral
                    examination. There's a board of examiners. I was an examiner, for example, for
                    the State Department, administering with others oral examinations for candidates
                    for the Foreign Service. But the two services in a sense are separate. AID
                    employees or Peace Corps employees are not FSO's, or Foreign Service Officers.
                    They're Foreign Service Reserve Officers, and they haven't gone through the
                    particular process that the Foreign Service Officers have gone through in the
                    manner of entry into the Service. AID employees in a sense are selected on the
                    basis of particular skills — agriculture, health or economics, programmers or
                    whatever the case may be. Some enter through the JMA or what used to be the JMA
                    examination or through an examination of their credentials through the filing of
                    what used to be a Form 57, which lays out your experience, your education and
                    salary and so forth and so on.</p>
                <p>So while they operate in the same country, AID persons or Peace Corps staffers
                    are in a sense adjuncts to the Foreign Service establishment but not really part
                    of it as the Foreign Service Officer, we'll say, conceives it. It's unusual for
                    persons who serve in other programs such as the Economic Assistance Program or
                    the Peace Corps Program to achieve ambassadorial status. This is an avenue which
                    is open to Foreign Service Officers in a sense by right, in fact, or to persons
                    who contribute to political campaigns or whatever the case might be. You have to
                    be a very wealthy man to be ambassador to the United Kingdom, for example,
                    because the salary just doesn't carry the expenses which accrue to that
                    position.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I think we can also say, as I said this morning, that the Foreign Service cadre
                    is or has been in the past predominantly coming from your Ivy League schools.
                    It's prestigious in a promotional sense or in an advancement sense; going
                    through the ranks in the Foreign Service is rather a slow process. In the AID
                    Agency you move fast, for example, because you're utilizing persons who bring
                    expertise to the organization, generally speaking. AID persons are much advanced
                    in grading as over Foreign Service persons, and I think there is some resentment
                    of this. And we work differently. AID persons work with the particular
                    government or host government. They work in administrative departments, they
                    work in bureaus, they advise, and so on, and they carry out programs and they
                    have resources. For example, a program I have administered had $30 million in
                    new obligations in a year. The embassy doesn't have those resources, and the
                    embassy Foreign Service Officers are observers and reporters, but they're not
                    persons who are in a sense directly involved with working shoulder to shoulder,
                    side by side with officials of the country. So, we have different purposes. The
                    Economic Assistance person is serving the U.S. interests, of course, but in a
                    sense, he's serving the interests, or should be serving the interests of the
                    host government as well, in terms of particular kinds of activities. If the
                    government wants to develop a health system, he participates in an advisory
                    capacity in establishing such a system. We bring over universities, we bring
                    over contractual types of persons who work as functionaries in the real sense in
                    that government. So therefore there is separation, yes; but the separation is
                    blurred. The Foreign Service person, as an observer, as a reporter, the
                    ambassador as a person who might wish to get a country to back a particular
                    policy of the United States, the U.N., in terms of its foreign policy, might
                    have a different kind of relationship, so that that's a difference.</p>
                <p>There's a difference in terms of how quickly one, if he's lucky, I guess, goes up
                    the scale of things. I started at grade 9, which is a secretaries grade really
                    today. That's not demeaning secretaries but that's what it was. But I was able
                    to get promoted two grades in six months, and that's unheard of in the Foreign
                    Service, and by 1966 I was at the top of the Foreign Service scale, equivalent
                    to a GS-18, and that's an ambassador's rank actually, in terms of salary, grade,
                    whatever you might wish to call it. So when they make some ... this creates some
                    difficulty, you see. I mean also the fact that you are more a part of the
                    situation, of the environment in which you are functioning, is also a real
                    difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>But all that aside, I think historically the Foreign Service, as a part of the
                    Civil Service apparatus of this government, has always been known as a
                    prestigious service. Few are admitted, for example; it is exclusionary in a kind
                    of way. Therefore, if you come from other ranks to a position of ambassador,
                    which. I guess every Foreign Service Officer in his heart when he enters the
                    Service wants — that's his goal — and you are an outsider in their terms and you
                    come into this kind of situation, in a sense you're still an outsider. So it's
                    like you're in the room, or in the institution, you're in the Department of
                    State, but you can be in a particular room or situation and not be a part or an
                    integral part, you see. I characterize it as the formal and the informal. You
                    have access to the formal network because that's the way things run. I mean, you
                    are who your are and you have that particular job. But in terms of the informal
                    structure, because you are an outsider, there's where the difficulty arises.
                    You're not a part of the network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But doesn't it make your job doubly difficult, because
                        doesn't a great deal of substance get tied up in the informal network of
                        what ....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An awful lot of things get resolved in the informal
                        network much easier than they would through the formal channels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I would say that was true, yes. At the same time, no one ... I can't say
                    ... but the structure to which you relate formally wants to succeed, and those
                    who people that structure want to succeed. You're part of the means by which
                    they do succeed. Therefore, they would not, presumably, get in the way of your
                    helping them to succeed by in a sense succeeding yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say “presumably.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Presumably, it's in the more subtle manifestations or characteristics
                    where the informal network chews at you. No, I have always said you should
                    surround yourself with the best people possible, because you're not successful
                    on your own; you're successful through the success of your associates and the
                    people that are working with you. I think the same thing would be true in the
                    situation that is more characteristic of the way it functions in the formal
                    sense. But the informal network operates possibly best in terms of assignments,
                    posts, and things of this kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of choosing your colleagues or the people who
                        must work with you, when you went in as Ambassador to Botswana, to the other
                        two countries, were you able to pick any of your staff or did you have to
                        work with people who were already there as Foreign Service Officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>NELSON: In Botswana I relieved the person who was there ... who preceded me, who
                    was charg� and who left shortly after I got there. He was using in a sense back
                    channels to achieve that, because I think in a real sense he was the person who
                    I would say was non-accepting. So I did have possibilities to approve people,
                    and one person was recommended and I turned that person down, which did not sit
                    well with the Department and they recommended someone else. And as time went on
                    you got new staff in and you always have to give your concurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much freedom do you have to turn someone down if you
                        feel it's some�one you can't work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: There are limits. There are limits to that because you can't... I guess
                    this is where a formal network comes into play. If you don't know these persons,
                    you have to work with these persons and, therefore, they are recommending people
                    to you, nominating people that you have no means, real means of ascertaining
                    whether these are the kinds of persons you might wish to work with or not, since
                    you're not really a part of that organization, and that is a difficulty. I think
                    I was fortunate in the main in that people that I've worked with in the various
                    embassies were good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In all three countries, then, did you ... you had totally
                        different staffs working for you, the Foreign Service Officers, this elite
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any members of those staffs that you asked to
                        have transferred possibly because they may not have been as accepting of
                        you, possibly? You said this was a very elite group. Were there many blacks
                        in the group? In 1971, if these were very elite groups of people, how
                        accepting were they of a black ambassador who was in fact sitting in the
                        spot all of them wanted (laugh), I imagine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Some were more accepting than others. There were no other blacks actually
                    and ... let me think about that for a moment ... that's not exactly true. Well,
                    a Foreign Service Officer lives and dies by the efficiency rating and you do
                    rate them. And even though you're not a member of the tribe ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That rating stands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>NELSON: The rating stands. And I don't say that ratings should be used in a
                    punitive way, but they recognize that their performance ... and there are ways
                    to look at a rating to see whether it's subjective or objective ... it's an
                    integrated whole ... whether it's inconsistent or whatever the case might be.
                    And it's also true that at this time in '71 and '72 that the Foreign Service
                    wives were saying that they weren't going to bake cookies and-some of them were
                    saying that they weren't going to do the things that ... this was the beginning
                    of the independence era and there's nothing wrong with that. But it is also true
                    that when they're functioning in another country, that the relationship was not
                    only their own relationship but the relationship of the family as well. And if
                    the wife doesn't adjust to the situation, and if the children don't adjust, that
                    it certainly detracts from the principal's performance and could have a negative
                    effect in the country itself, on the people of the country and so on. Therefore,
                    while you may not be able to ask Mrs. X or Mrs. Y to have a dinner party or
                    whatever the case might be, you still have to say whether the officer carries
                    out his obligations; his obligations are social as well as functional. In other
                    words, it's the whole, an entity, and this means, of course, that if the wife
                    doesn't participate, doesn't function, that this detracts from the principal's
                    functioning because a lot of your work is done in a social environment. And it's
                    not always in someone else's home or whatever; it has to be in your home as well
                    and failure to participate then detracts.</p>
                <p>One correction I think is the Foreign Service isn't elitist elite. A lot of the
                    persons who are part of it don't necessarily measure up to that standard. So
                    your ability to evaluate the performance of the officers with whom you are
                    associated is an important aspect of your job because I don't know if it's still
                    the rule, but negative ratings or rankings ... all Foreign Service Officers are
                    in a sense in the same class ... and vertical structure like economic officers
                    or political officers and so forth are evaluated worldwide against each other on
                    the basis of their written ratings. And then promotion is given to those in the
                    various classes who are at the top, and it used to be that if you were passed
                    over for so many years you were in a sense rejected from the Service. So that
                    feature was helpful and the fact that it is there is helpful, but at the same
                    time there, it has to be done on an objective basis, not a subjective basis
                    because it can be very damaging to someone's career.</p>

                    of them. No, I would agree with you, being ambassador to one country is

                    24 hours a day, but that's not the case. But it's very important to have good
                    associates, productive associates, associates who bring something to the table,
                    rather than be just recipients. It is a kind of wearing existence because when
                    do you relax, and people, you know, talk about the cocktail circuit and all
                    that, but that too is work. And in a kind of way, I guess you'd say that you're
                    always on your guard. And even in your home, you have people that you have to
                    have, for instance, people who work for you, and they're observing you as well
                    as everyone else. So this possibly can be exaggerated, but at the same time I
                    think it's very real that you are under an almost constant scrutiny.
                    Fortunately, however, every two years or every ... once in a two-year period
                    assignment you do get something called R&amp;R — rest and rehabilitation, or
                    something, and you get a chance to go off to some R&amp;R post. For example,
                    when we were in southern Africa we went to the Seychelles in Mauritius, which
                    permits you to get out of the environment and have a little fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that period last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh, about 30 days, 30 calendar days I think. So that's helpful. And of
                    course, every two years you do ... ambassadors don't get home leave but in the
                    AID agency when ... everyone except the ambassador gets something called home
                    leave which is ... which permits you to get back to the United States for about
                    60 to 90 days, where you live out of suitcases and travel from relative to
                    relative, actually. That's not true (laughter), but it serves another purpose,
                    too, and that is that part of this business is keeping up contacts and
                    acquaintances and so forth and so on, and letting people know that you're around
                    and what you're interested in and so on. I remember when I was in Tanzania, John
                    Hannah, who I mentioned previously, came there with Mrs. Hannah and we took a
                    trip around Tanzania, by air, primarily to see some of the things that we were
                    doing in the country. And it was at that time that I was up, I think, for
                    reassignment, or I was coming up for reassignment. I'd been in Tanzania for
                    almost three years and I'd been in correspondence with the head of the African
                    Bureau and they were saying that no, I shouldn't come on home leave because
                    there might be someone who was politically, you know ... or had some political
                    strings who could come in and take your post. So even though I call myself in
                    AID terms a career person, I was not recruited because I was a Democrat or
                    Republican or whatever the case might be. But when you get ... when you're a
                    director or deputy director you're in a so-called exempt position and this calls
                    for various clearances and so on ... White House clearances, etc. And the idea
                    was that maybe at that particular moment — I don't know — but this sometimes
                    happens that when they send up the name to be assigned as a director or
                    reassigned as a director to post X out of the AID system, that someone in the
                    White House might say we have an obligation to John Smith over here, and we'll
                    put John Smith in this position. What you then do is that you revert back to
                    your (laughter) old status.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So this was actually transpiring, and I remember John Hannah sitting down in our
                    living room in Dar es Salaam and he said, “Don't you worry. Actually, this is
                    not the end of your assignment.” He was the head of the ... administrator or the
                    head of the agency, of the Economic Assistance Program. Because he was briefed
                    before he came out about the question of reassignment or ongoing forward
                    assignment that had to arise, so he said, “Don't you worry, things are okay here
                    until the summer.”</p>
                <p>So I would imagine, conjecture, pure and simple, that his visit and — he stayed
                    in our home — and traveling about together. We went to see President Nyerere and
                    a number of other things — this played a role, because it was from Tanzania that
                    I left to ... the post of ambassador and of course, he had to agree. I'm sure he
                    did quite well. It's my conjecture but I'm sure he had a role. He also visited
                    us and stayed with us in Botswana and we had again an opportunity to take him
                    about and to call on ministers and other persons in government. He was a very
                    fine man actually, and gave me lots of good advice on the ... some of which
                    maybe I wasn't as good in following as need be. That's when I ... when this
                    person came out from Washington when I was in this meeting in Addis Ababa and
                    called me out at the first coffee break and told me this and said you cannot
                    turn it down, that I was somewhat taken aback, that how could this happen in
                    this kind of situation when in this other situation people were expressing
                    anxieties that you weren't going to be reappointed to your post, that
                    politically there might be someone else coming into it? I don't know how I got
                    into that, but anyhow (laughter) ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: For any person working along in government, there's a great deal you can
                    plan from A to Z, but a lot of it is really luck, I suppose, and the manner in
                    which you do your job. This took place in Tanzania, but I remember there was a
                    delegation. Some group came out from the United States. You know teachers go on
                    trips and take this off their taxes, well, orientation trips or something like
                    that. But the function was one that the ambassador carries out sometimes when
                    such groups do come through a country, you have to give a reception for them or
                    something like that. And I remember being at that sort of party — out in the
                    garden — and I was talking to a Tanzanian and one of these visitors came over
                    and wanted to know what do you do, are you with the Embassy? And I said no, I am
                    with the Assistance Mission here, and the Tanzanian in effect said what is
                    meaningful to us in Tanzania is the economic assistance program. The Embassy
                    doesn't really make any difference (laughter) ... It is no matter, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Tanzanian officials from the Embassy
                        nearby?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>NELSON: No, no. But this is the other side of it in the sense that not that
                    you're buying ... you can't buy a country ... and you wouldn't have a country
                    that you could buy anyhow, and you're not buying people because people who can
                    be bought aren't worth whatever it takes, but it speaks to the relationship
                    between persons who are involved with economic assistance programs vis-a-vis
                    officials of the host government, because you're functioning together and over
                    against the other side which takes but in a sense doesn't give. And it varies
                    from place to place and from time to time and from person to person, like if I
                    am sitting here with ... and this isn't exact ... let's say I'm sitting here
                    with the ability to fund a program, if we can come to an agreement and so forth
                    and so on, and this means, of course, within the U.S. policy, etc., etc. And
                    that has, I guess, a different coloration to one's presence. The other fellow is
                    sitting over there and he's trying to get something or get them to, you know, to
                    deal in a certain kind of ... commercial way with the United States. And that's
                    also another kind of coloration, and I think it's ... my sense is that there is
                    some kind of feeling — that's a neutral word — feeling on an individual's part
                    because he is not in that ... he or she is not in that particular position.
                    That's not too obscure, I hope (laughter).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little. Would you like to break it down a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, okay, this is the situation. For example, a government that I
                    worked with wanted to undertake a particular program and wanted to get a
                    particular institution involved. We funded that program and we got the request
                    and did the proposals and so on, so on and so on, fought it out with Washington
                    and got that program approved and that program was of the magnitude ... that
                    particular segment of the total program was in the magnitude of about $15
                    million, we'll say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>NELSON: That particular segment of a total program would cost about $15 million
                    over a period of a few years. That does something in terms of how you interact
                    with the government in that your presence and, in a sense, your working together
                    results in tangible assets flowing — even though these might be borrowed funds
                    or grant funds or whatever the case might be — and these tangible assets permit
                    a government, or permit a government to carry out an activity which has as its
                    purpose benefiting people, increasing the economic well-being of the country as
                    a whole, and of course, it has a political quotient in that if it serves
                    people's needs, it then is a reflection, a positive reflection on that
                    particular administration. Okay, that gives a different aura to the individual
                    or to the organization or to the people who are working in concert to bring this
                    about because the government realizes that they are influencing you by their
                    actions, you are accepting their modifications when you broker out the situation
                    and activity and then you are in a sense your own representative and their
                    representative in Washington to get this activity through the powers that be.
                    And if it's successful — something tangible happens which does all of these
                    things, or presumably should do all of these things.</p>
                <p>The other fellow sitting over there — we're in economic programs, economic
                    section of the embassy, for example — he's interested in the economy but he's
                    interested in the economy from a reporting standpoint and you report
                    economically as well from the economic assistance side. And they don't
                    necessarily coincide with our views, but he's sitting over there dredging out
                    information and so forth and so on. But his activity results in no tangible
                    asset to the government. I'm not saying we're buying people or anything like
                    that, but this is part of what you are and what you do and so on and so on. What
                    resources are behind you, and that sometimes doesn't sit too well. And I've been
                    in situations where the embassy, let's say, might encourage a particular
                    undertaking and we would have to come along and discourage it. And that really
                    shouldn't be because before overt steps are taken, you know, there should be
                    some kind of consultation that takes place. That's what happens in the best of
                    all worlds and sometimes it doesn't happen and so that specificity would be
                    lacking. (Laughter).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did say you could take it out later if you wanted ....
                        (laughter).the more you can say .... now remember historians years later
                        will want as much specificity as you can possibly spare.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I became ill in Kenya, actually, and I came back to the United States and
                    had surgery and I was away for quite some time. Now that gives you a
                    geographical fix, doesn't it? But someone had said, we will do “X”, okay? And
                    therefore we explored the feasibility of it, and it cost us money to explore the
                    feasibility of it. Not immense sums, but money. It was not feasible, it was not.
                    Therefore, we didn't do it. Well, maybe commitments had been made; I don't know.
                    But that didn't sit very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you didn't do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, because it was not a feasible undertaking. It was a small thing, but
                    here was a situation where here in a sense they got out in front without being
                    certain of the ground that they were traveling over. My problem, I guess, for
                    example, you talk about getting people ... and this gives you an idea of the
                    difference. I knew I got the AID person that I wanted for southern Africa to be
                    in charge of the AID program there. He had worked for me in Tanzania. I knew he
                    was a good worker, intelligent, and all that. My problem was even though I
                    carried the auxiliary title of economic coordinator for the area was — in a kind
                    of way — to let him do his job. The natural predilection on my part having come
                    from the Economic Assistant Program and having worked together in a mission in
                    Tanzania, would be in a sense to ... and where he had been the program officer —
                    was in a sense to continue that type relationship. But actually he was not the
                    program officer; he was the director of the AID program and as a director of
                    that AID program, he in a sense was in charge of it. I wasn't in charge of it in
                    terms of implementation.</p>
                <p>So I think two things are that one, you have to know what your role is and you
                    have to know what the other person's role is. And you have to let that person
                    perform in his role as long as that performance is in keeping with our overall
                    policy and so forth, and second is that I knew the personalities in the AID
                    program, and therefore I was able to reach out and get the person that I wanted
                    and I didn't have any problems with Washington on that score. But in terms of
                    looking into the barrel of the State Department, it's like people anonymous when
                    you come from the outside, and that's one of the difficulties that you have.</p>
                <p>Well, in a sense this has been more economic assistance than State Department per
                    se. I also think that I have been in every agency that was represented in the
                    three countries, with the exception of the cultural and USIS program. Therefore,
                    I had a background in the Peace Corps; I had a background in AID; and I was
                    functioning as a State Department person. And, of course, you know all these
                    persons are in a sense entities and representatives of the so-called country
                    team, and I do believe that it enabled me to function with possibly greater
                    effect and greater understanding. When I was up for my confirmation hearings,
                    Senator Fulbright was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate.
                    And, of course, they have your background and you have to tell them, you have to
                    recite your experience and so forth and so on. And I was coming from the AID
                    program to which he said in effect the State Department was being smart or
                    something like that. I didn't know Fulbright at all, and he was most famous ...
                    very influential in the foreign affairs community, foreign relations community
                    and had deep understanding of it, said it was a very positive thing for the
                    State Department to have someone from AID go into this kind of position.</p>

                    opportunity came to pass; a country that wasn't too large, a country which had
                    an approach to an economic and political future that I could be accepting of, I
                    guess. I'm not looking for something that would be easy, but a country where we
                    felt there was an opportunity to be of positive or ... positive, to have a
                    positive impact. Before I went to Tanzania I read a great deal about Tanzania's
                    President Nyerere, the leadership that he has put forth in Africa. And as a part
                    of the process of orientation that you go through and before you go out to these
                    countries, you go through New York and you spend time with concerns that have an
                    interest in them. I think almost you spend about 4 or 5 days doing this in New
                    York City and almost without exception the person that I had contact with in New
                    York had sort of sympathized or extended their condolences to me for the fact
                    that I was going to Tanzania, a Socialist country, and actually in their terms,
                    a Communist country. And that was the image in a sense that they had and the
                    impressions that they were giving me. Some of that was current in the U.S.
                    Government establishment as well.</p>
                <p>Well, let's put it this way, Tanzania was one of the most rewarding work
                    experiences that I've ever had, one of the most rewarding. True, Tanzania is in
                    very difficult straits economically. It's been buffeted by poor weather in terms
                    of agriculture and all the rest of it the last few years. And it is trying to
                    establish a system which is truly theirs, truly Tanzanian; flows from tradition
                    and culture and all the rest of it. And it isn't free enterprise in the sense of
                    actions and some other things you might say, but while at the same time we have
                    the prerogative of helping or not helping the country, equally so the country
                    has the prerogative ... the people of the country really, to structure its
                    system in a sense that it sees fit and certainly the thing is that they have
                    been working hard to bring real vitalness to their society and to their country,
                    and they were trying to do it in a way in which ... with egalitarianism where
                    you didn't have wide disparities between people in terms of their well-being,
                    their hopes and so on. It' egalitarianism. And that's what they want. I don't
                    see anything wrong with it. And after all it's theirs to do with as they see fit
                    in a sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>But there are so many misconceptions, I think, about governments and about people
                    which every now and then have currency in the United States, and that certainly
                    was true of Tanzania. Because if you look at any country in Africa and you look
                    at our own development and you look at developments that take place in Europe or
                    whatever, and the history is very, very short, very, very short history. The
                    progress isn't a straight line. So in thinking or speaking or talking about a
                    country where one might wish to go, there's always that question whether it is
                    something which is a mirror image of our system or what. What you really want, I
                    guess, is to go to a place where a government is dedicated to enhancing its
                    independence by bringing benefits to all its people, or something like that. I
                    doubt that at my mature years, and soon (laughter), this can come to pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughter - unintelligible). You think young, Mr.
                        Ambassador, in this interview. You can't say that. When we started this
                        session you said there might be a few things you'd like to add about those
                        years in Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, I think naturally so in my remarks I gravitated more ... laid stress
                    on, or however you might wish to characterize it, on the Botswanan experience.
                    I'm not trying to wish that away or take that back, but I think it also should
                    be said that I think this is natural in the sense that Botswana is where I spent
                    the preponderance of my time. But then putting that aside, these countries are
                    generally referred to as the BLS, as you probably know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NELSON: Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland are all grouped together as the BLS
                    countries because of that character that they had their independence and they
                    were black-ruled, and they have multiracial societies. But while in my comments,
                    as I say, more stress has been laid on Botswana, it should also be said that the
                    countries are different. They have certain things in common and that's more
                    geographical than anything else. But each in its own right and in its own way is
                    attempting to do in a real sense the same thing. They go about it differently,
                    under different systems, under different leadership, and with different
                    potential. In some respects, Lesotho, we'll say, is less fortunate than
                    Swaziland, and maybe, I don't know whether it's exact or not, maybe Swaziland
                    may be less fortunate than Botswana when one speaks of endowment, but the
                    critical question is how effectively are they using their resources as well as
                    other resources that might flow to them to give meaning to their independence.
                    And I think here that there is little if any difference. Some may be more
                    successful than others. Some may be approaching it ... approaching the task of
                    bringing real meaning to nationhood differently, but I think the goal or goals
                    would be generally similar in each of the countries. And this again is the fact
                    that they are different and therefore different systems, different cultures,
                    different traditions, and different ways of going at a particular objective. I
                    wouldn't want anything that I say to in a sense infer that this was not the
                    case. I think it's also true that relating almost naturally or in a subconscious
                    kind of way to that which is more similar which strikes me, of course, with our
                    own apperception that which you are most knowledgeable about, or familiar with,
                    that which seems to run more or less concurrently with our own views, own views,
                    I suppose; not views, but experiences. So the stress is that they are different.
                    The exist in different circumstances and this covers a whole range of things.
                    But despite that, I would have to say, I think, with real conviction that they
                    are attempting to give real substance to their independence. It should also be
                    stated that the countries were not in a sense colonies like Kenya or some of the
                    other African countries; they were trusteeships, and some people say
                    historically that the metropole did not relate too effectively to them in their
                    dependency status because it was assumed that at some point in time they might
                    flow into or be submerged within the Republic of South Africa, what we know as
                    the Republic of South Africa. Therefore, there is very limited investment of
                    whatever kind in these countries to combat that. Botswana, I think, had very,
                    very few high school graduates when it came into being. They've also had
                    leaders, a significant number of leaders who received the training that they did
                    at Fort Hare in South Africa, for example. Lesotho, and this is apparent today
                    because of its literacy, and interestingly enough, looking at the population as
                    a whole, women have higher attainment in literacy than the men do, but also they
                    have Pope Pius XII University there which, I said before became BLS until BLS
                    was broken up. But they're all doing it. Like Frank Sinatra says, they're doing
                    it their way (laughter).</p>
                <p>So, you know, you talk about what you know best but at the same time it's not a
                    slight to the other two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did spend ever so much more time, there, in a

                <p>NELSON: That's true...</p>

                <p>NELSON: Okay.</p>

                <p>NELSON: Okay, I can't really think of anything additional there that I could add.
                    I don't know who the audience will be for these tapes, but..</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No, I was thinking about ... you know, the question about young people
                    and so on. I think we have covered that. The only thing I can say is that in
                    final terms I suppose that working abroad, or working in the Foreign Service, or
                    whatever it may be, is a very rewarding way to spend one's life because I firmly
                    believe that this is a world of interdependency — which has almost become a
                    clich� now — but I think it's very true, and we need to have more people in our
                    society that recognize this and in a sense recognize the benefits that flow from
                    a positive and a contributing relationship to the so-called developing world.
                    And participation in this environment, at whatever level, increases one's own
                    appreciation and I think that while you make a contribution ...we seek to make a
                    contribution — that in many, many insidious, non-tangible ways or non-apparent
                    ways, you're a much better person, a much more fulfilled person because of this
                    kind of experience. In other words, you are a receiver of goods as well as a
                    contributor. (Laughter).</p>

                <p>Addendum: (The question was again raised by the interviewer about any
                    difficulties he may have experienced in traveling to and from his posts having
                    to pass through white South Africa).</p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, the question is in a sense how ... what was the effect of having to
                    travel to and through South Africa. When I went into South Africa by air, by
                    some means I usually notified the Embassy in Pretoria that I was coming. I was
                    always met by protocol, South African protocol, and you were taken to a VIP room
                    so that you didn't in a sense mingle with people. When we arrived in South
                    Africa ... this was before they had the new international airport which
                    presumably doesn't have any signs for blacks or whites or coloreds, in their
                    terms, again we were taken to the VIP room. In a sense you're isolated.</p>
                <p>Driving across the country you were always not apprehensive but in a sense alert
                    and, you know, the common things ... you had to take our lunch, I had to take my
                    lunch with the driver. If you went to a filling station, could you use the
                    facilities? We would drive up to get gas and people would ask the driver: “Who
                    is that?” One time a car got a little rambunctious with us and fortunately or
                    unfortunately ... fortunately, I have to say, the South African road patrol was
                    there and they stopped the car and they also stopped us and they asked our
                    driver if that person cut in front of us causing us to brake suddenly. Of
                    course, we said yes, and he waved us on.</p>
                <p>Another time we were going down the road and there was a policeman on foot ... I
                    guess he had a car but he stopped us. He came up to the car and said, “Left-hand
                    drive.” Then he told us to proceed on. There was not too much harassment,
                    however. I remember once I traveled with the Nigerian Ambassador to our High
                    Commissioner to Lesotho for Lesotho Independence Day. He was in my car and we
                    were going through South African customs immediately upon leaving Botswana, and
                    the customs person made some remark about the leader of his country, I think it
                    was General Gowan at that time, and it wasn't a very pleasant occurrence.
                    Another thing is ... which makes you realize that you're never too far out of
                    sight.</p>
                <p>I'd been on a field trip with my consular officer, and had been gone for about
                    four or five days, and had gone all the way down to Bokspits, which is a very
                    interesting place in itself. It's where caracal (fur) comes from and the people
                    of Bokspits all have South African names and so forth and so on. They're
                    supposedly Hottentot and other mixtures, and actually their language is
                    Afrikaans. But we were coming back and we were stopping, we stopped to have
                    something done to the car in this town ... small town, just over the border from
                    Botswana, and we were walking down the street and a person came up and said to
                    my consular officer: “We have made arrangements at the border post for you to go
                    through.” Now he didn't know me, he didn't know the consular officer, but they
                    knew who we were. In other words, they had their eyes on you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They probably followed you, in a sense, the entire time
                        you were traveling in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>NELSON: Although we had been in Botswana, but we had to come out of Botswana to
                    go by road to go back into Botswana, so we were just crossing a small portion of
                    South Africa, but they knew we were there. And I couldn't walk up to someone in
                    the middle of the street here in Washington and say ... or identify them if I'd
                    never seen them before or anything like that, but they were able to do that. So
                    they are conscious , but I can say that we stayed in a hotel and we did things,
                    went to restaurants in Capetown and so on with other Embassy people. But I'm
                    sure that when you appeared on the scene ... the way had been prepared. So they
                    were very guarded in a sense that no untoward occurrence take place. And none
                    did (laughter).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have another question. During your stay there, were
                        there any major incidents between the people ... between your countries and
                        South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Not that I could really call major. There is a place in Botswana, for
                    example, Francistown, which is a rail center. And during this period, of course,
                    there were people coming into Botswana and some of the other countries in a
                    refugee-type situation, that was greatly accelerated subsequently. We did have
                    some persons from South Africa in a sense escaping through Botswana. There were
                    some situations in Lesotho which I cannot recall too specifically at this point
                    in time, but as a generalization, I would say that the relationships between the
                    various countries were correct. One of the things which we all ... not we all
                    but some of us deplored were the hotels. When you had meager resources you tried
                    to gain from what you can, and, of course, in South Africa there are no casinos
                    and there are no, I've forgotten, R-type movies, and things of this kind. So
                    each of these hotels had a casino and the South Africans would really flow over
                    the borders to frequent them and buy the Playboy magazines and all this kind of
                    thing, because, you know, the oppressiveness of that society, although I don't
                    think Playboy is a criterion for such a thing. But anyhow ... and, of course,
                    they had these casinos and the nightclub atmosphere had an influence, societal
                    influence ... young ladies and all the rest of it, you know, in South Africa ...
                    which was not positive. And some of the governments excluded their own
                    nationals. One government did exclude its nationals from participating in the
                    casinos, for example. I know those of us who were in the various diplomatic
                    missions didn't look askance at this, but we in a sense deplored it because here
                    were people from South Africa coming into their countries to carry on, we'll
                    say, which in a way they couldn't in their own country, but it didn't
                    demonstrate any sense of respect for these countries, although they needed the
                    hotels but they didn't need the gambling and the kinds of elements which this
                    kind of facility attracted.</p>
                <p>In a government sense, the relationships were correct and I think that's probably
                    the best characterization. Certainly they weren't warm, but correct. Oh, I would
                    say, too, that other than the fact that these casinos are resource generators,
                    they wouldn't have been there.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I'm sure they're still there. Although in one of the bantustans now or
                    one of the so-called independent African nations within the nation ... within
                    the Republic of South Africa where Frank Sinatra just appeared, they do have a
                    casino and all that, so maybe they don't have to travel to Lesotho or Botswana
                    or Swaziland for this purpose (laughter), you know.</p>
