                <p>[Note: This transcript was not edited by Elizabeth Brown]</p>
                <p>This is Thomas J. Dunnigan. Today I will be doing an interview on behalf of the
                    Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training in the Foreign Affairs Oral
                    History Program. The person I will be interviewing is Elizabeth Ann Brown, who
                    had a long career in the field of foreign affairs, divided between the
                    Department of State and the Foreign Service. Elizabeth is one of the real
                    experts on the United Nations, having given many years of her service to that
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elizabeth, will you tell me how you became interested in a
                        career in foreign affairs and how you got into the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I studied international relations and political science as an
                    undergraduate and graduate student. Eventually, during World War II, I worked
                    briefly for the War Labor Board. However, I continued to work at Reed College
                    for my major professor, who had been associated with the State Department in a
                    post-war planning group. At the time he was aware that I was interested in
                    returning to the field of international affairs.</p>
                <p>As the work of the War Labor Board wound down, I was able to transfer to the
                    State Department in the summer of 1945, working initially in the Office of
                    International Organization Affairs, as it was then called, which was beginning
                    to organize United States participation in what was to become the United
                    Nations. Shortly after entering the State Department in the summer of 1945 I
                    attended the second part of the first session of the UN General Assembly in New
                    York as a junior adviser. Most of the people who were working on UN affairs in
                    Washington simply moved back and forth between Washington and New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first came into the Department, for whom did you
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I worked for Durward Sandifer, who was the Director of the Office of
                    International Organization Affairs. In that office I also worked directly with
                    David Popper and Paul Taylor.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Department supportive of the new UN
                        system, or was the Department cynical or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that there was a problem initially. The Foreign Service was a bit
                    cool about international organizations which were not traditional diplomatic
                    mechanisms. It was somewhat difficult at first to encourage Foreign Service
                    Officers to participate in international organizations. Many of the staff were
                    civil servants. I was, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were women officers accepted in the service at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I think that there were problems at the time I worked in
                    international organization affairs. There were only three of us women on the
                    political side at the time: Dorothy Fosdick, Betty Goff, and myself, although on
                    the economic and social side there were a lot of women who remained active over
                    the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What specific functions were you first given to work
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that one of the first projects I had was related to the procedures
                    of the General Assembly. I participated in a special committee headed by a
                    Canadian diplomat, Erskine Reed, to set up procedures that still are applicable
                    in the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those early years there was a bit of a struggle, was
                        there not, between the General Assembly and the Security Council over
                        jurisdictional matters—who was going to handle what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, in the early years the Security Council was recognized as the
                    primary, political organ of the UN. The General Assembly—really until late in
                    the mid 1950's—presumed to take over major political issues, although it debated
                    some of them, even in the early years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem about the permanent site for the
                        United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was argued initially that we could use the League of Nations facilities
                    in Geneva, [Switzerland], and that this would be more economical [since the
                    building was already constructed]. There was a strong sense that, to keep the
                    United States directly involved, the organization's headquarters should be here
                    in the United States. Really, as I recall the debate at the time, there never
                    was a serious move to take the UN out of New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those early years—1947, of course—the issue of
                        Palestine arose. How did that affect your work—or did it affect it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Only marginally, because when I was in New York, I worked to a great
                    degree on international legal affairs, although I was not a lawyer. I
                    participated as a reporting officer during the Palestine debate. I was not
                    involved in the substance of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1948 the General Assembly held a meeting in Paris. Did
                        you attend that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I did attend it. I had a double role. I was the reporter for the [U.
                    S.] delegation meetings and also organized the annual report on the work of the
                    UN. It was a very interesting time because everyone expected that there would be
                    a change in the [U. S.] administration.</p>
                <p>The General Assembly went to Paris to get away from the hurly-burly of the
                    American electoral process. Secretary of State Marshall headed the [U. S.]
                    delegation, and John Foster Dulles, who fully expected to be Secretary of State,
                    also was present. I can recall going to those meetings. Secretary Marshall and I
                    would be the first ones to turn up at the meetings. He usually wore his overcoat
                    because Paris was very chilly in those days.</p>
                <p>John Foster Dulles was given free rein to interview and meet with all of the
                    Foreign Ministers who were present at that meeting of the General Assembly. He
                    assumed, of course, that he was going to be Secretary of State. It came as a
                    terrible blow when the returns came in from the election [of 1948].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that you were the rapporteur of the [U. S.]
                        delegation. Did you have to draft the daily telegrams back to the
                        Department, or did you have help on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I drafted the daily telegrams to the Department and I drafted or
                    dictated into a Dictaphone very detailed minutes [of the meetings]. I discovered
                    that some of these minutes got into the legal digest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you didn't get much opportunity to enjoy the
                        delights of Paris, working that schedule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I didn't see a great deal of Paris. However, it was my first visit
                    to Europe, and I saw a good bit of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During those early years I understand that you came across
                        an amazing assortment of Soviet representatives: Molotov, Brzezinski,
                        Gromyko, Zorin, and Malik. How did you rate them—all the same, or were some
                        worse than others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that Molotov, perhaps, had a bit more finesse. He came, of course,
                    to the early sessions of the General Assembly. Brzezinski was an out-and-out
                    Soviet apparatchik. The others didn't leave me with a strong impression—no one
                    more than the others. From 1946 to 1960 we had a relatively “easy” time in the
                    General Assembly, organizing the votes to pass resolutions that we wanted,
                    against the votes of a solid Soviet bloc. The work was not as difficult as it
                    has become today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I referred earlier to the Palestine inquiry. Did the
                        killing of Count Bernadotte [in Jerusalem in 1948] have any great effect on
                        our policy or on what eventually happened there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't really know. I recall the great shock it was at the time, but,
                    beyond that, I think that our policy slowly evolved in a very difficult set of
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To pursue that point a little further, Israel became
                        independent in 1948, and war broke out with several Arab countries. The
                        United Nations became involved with truce commissions and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1949 was a year when the Chinese representation issue arose, with “Red China”
                    taking over Beijing and the government, presenting us with an issue which
                    continued to be active at the UN for many years.</p>
                <p>BROWN: It's true that the Chinese Communists came to the General Assembly and the
                    Security Council in 1950, at the outset of the Korean War. An unsuccessful
                    effort was made at that time to engage them in fruitful negotiations. They came
                    to New York and then left rather quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that there was an attempt to engage them in
                        negotiations. Was that by the U. S.? Did we do it, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were certainly part of it. However, you are quite right. The Chinese
                    representation question went on for years, and it really took the full time of
                    one individual [in the State Department] to make sure that Communist China was
                    not admitted to the U. N.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Despite all the attempts by India and other countries to
                        have Communist China admitted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BROWN: That's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, 1950 brought a major event in our history, the
                        Korean War, with its tremendous implications for the United Nations. Were
                        you deeply involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, relatively so, of course, because we sought initially to get United
                    Nations “cover” [for our efforts] and a United Nations Command, for which one
                    might read the United States. During the period of the Korean War we had what
                    was called the “Korean briefing meetings,” which the State Department held with
                    the countries that contributed troops.</p>
                <p>When the war was at its height, the briefing meetings were held weekly. I also
                    participated in them in terms of preparing briefing papers for the U. S.
                    representative, U. Alexis Johnson [then Assistant Secretary of State for Far
                    Eastern Affairs]. I prepared reports on the meetings and did the reporting
                    cable, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any friction in those days between the Bureaus
                        of Far Eastern Affairs and International Organization Affairs with regard to
                        Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not really. Certainly, the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs handled the
                    substance of the matter almost exclusively, but with some input from the Bureau
                    of International Organization Affairs. As I said, the Assistant Secretary for
                    Far Eastern Affairs [U. Alexis Johnson] headed the Korean briefing meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, of course, in 1950 or 1951 the Chinese Communists
                        entered the Korean War in great strength, and that changed the nature of the
                        war to some extent. I recall that General MacArthur was dismissed from his
                        command [by President Truman in April, 1951]. Did that have a great effect
                        on what we were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think it did. I don't think that it really changed matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many defenders of MacArthur in IO [Bureau of
                        International Organization Affairs] and in other parts of the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think so. Everybody felt that if you were going to run an
                    international organization, you had to have a more compromising and cooperative

                        a seat in the General Assembly, much to the annoyance of the Chinese

                <p>BROWN: Well, Taiwan had had that seat all along.</p>

                        understand that there was some difficulty when the General Assembly building
                        was taken over, by dissidents who were opposed to our policy.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not particularly important, but I thought that it
                        might be of interest. There were continuing wrangles over admissions to the
                        UN throughout the 1950's—not only China but other countries as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We had a longstanding stalemate on the admission of new members to the UN.
                    We initially favored staying with the original 51 members. Then there were
                    applicants whom we regarded as completely qualified but who were repeatedly
                    vetoed by the Soviet representative.</p>
                <p>I happened to be directly involved in Washington and I would have to review my
                    own notes and the annual reports of the UN to recapture now all the ins and outs
                    of getting these states into the UN. Suffice it to say that, in the end, we
                    reached a compromise and got them in over a few recalcitrant people in the State
                    Department who were keen to have countries like the Republic of Korea [South
                    Korea] admitted at the same time. The divided countries were in a different
                    category—South Korea, East Germany, and so forth. But it was a long drawn-out
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1952, apparently, during the American presidential
                        election campaign, there were signs of antagonism to having the UN in the U.
                        S., presumably mixed up with the election campaign. Did any of that affect
                        the Department at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think that it did, to any great extent. After all, John Foster
                    Dulles, who became Secretary of State [in the Eisenhower administration], had
                    been a member of the U. S. delegation at the San Francisco Conference in 1945. I
                    think that he was generally very positively disposed [to the UN]. I suspect that
                    that made a great difference, but certainly the “extreme right” had a certain,
                    ingrown antipathy toward international organizations.</p>

                <p>In 1953 the Korean armistice agreement was reached, which has continued in effect
                    until this day.</p>
                <p>BROWN: That is correct, and I remember it well. I think that it was concluded in
                    July, 1953. We had an agreement with our Allies that, because the armistice
                    itself was an imperfect document in terms of ensuring the peace, we would have a
                    separate declaration, known as the “Joint Policy Declaration,” which all of us
                    would sign at the time the armistice agreement went into effect. The “Joint
                    Policy Declaration” stated that in the event of a renewal of hostilities we
                    would all react promptly. Along with someone from the Treaty Affairs Section of
                    the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, I spent one Saturday
                    escorting people back and forth from the various embassies of the 16 countries
                    which had participated in the Korean War who signed this “Joint Policy
                    Declaration.”</p>
                <p>I must say that I think that it is lost to posterity at this point. I'm sure that
                    no one would accept it as a binding obligation today.</p>

                        replacing Trygve Lie. Did that have any repercussions on our policy? Were we

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that we were very pleased with Hammarskjold, who was a much more
                    “on the job” type of Secretary General. He himself was a rather quiet person but
                    a very forceful one. He was a man who thoroughly understood the issues to a much
                    greater degree than Trygve Lie had done.</p>

                        followed him. However, I gather that we were not under any great pressure to
                        withdraw from the UN.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I did not. We sent people who had attended the 1945 meeting. I was not

                <p>BROWN: I think that our Soviet colleagues were always willing to meet and talk.
                    However, from the point of view of getting anything done, they didn't seem to

                <p>BROWN: Yes. There was a long, drawn-out argument about domestic affairs being

                    Jan Christian Smuts appeared and defended his country's policies and was to
                    reappear later at the UN. But, over the years, the South Africans became more

                <p>BROWN: Almost all of those early elections were much more a matter of contention

                <p>BROWN: That's right. The United States parted company with our French and British

                <p>BROWN: Yes, in 1956. Of course, that was an extremely sad situation because, on
                    the one hand, we were involved in the Middle East and terribly concerned that a
                    major war did not break out over that. However, the Soviet Bloc states,
                    including Hungary, had really been encouraged to “break out” of the traces of
                    Soviet domination. Speeches had been made [by John Foster Dulles during the 1952
                    elections campaign] about “liberating” Eastern Europe. The Hungarians were
                    pleading for and believing that they would get assistance. It was a case of

                    Political Affairs. An Office of UN Economic and Social Affairs was later broken
                    off from that. Our involvement in the General Assembly and the Security Council

                <p>BROWN: Oh, I think that we were concerned but a bit more relaxed than we might be
                    today because there were no practical results for those countries. The debates
                    continued just the same. I don't recall that it was a terribly upsetting

                <p>BROWN: It was a very exciting time because the satellite went up during the UN
                    General Assembly session. I was in New York when the news came. Everybody was
                    congratulating the Russians. There was a rush to organize UN activity in the
                    whole field of outer space. Eventually, an Outer Space committee was
                    established, whose meetings I attended for some period of time. Not that I think
                    that it achieved a great deal, except to focus on the need to ensure the
                    peaceful uses of outer space.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958 there was a Special Session of the UN General
                        Assembly on the Middle East. This apparently led to a push for a permanent
                        UN force to keep the peace around the world. However, that was put aside at
                        the request of the Secretary General. Did we favor that? Would we have
                        earmarked troops for such a UN force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I doubt it. Of course, the UN charter provided for a Military Staff
                    Committee to be set up. National forces were to be provided [to the UN]. In
                    those early years of the UN the Military Staff Committee met regularly [in New
                    York] and got absolutely nowhere. I think that we tended to agree that making ad
                    hoc arrangements at the time of international outbreaks of fighting worked
                    better. Of course, this was Hammarskjold's view.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the whole problem of peacekeeping became a major issue at about that
                    time because the Soviets declined to pay their share [of the costs]. There was a
                    considerable effort made to deal with this problem in terms of finding ways to
                    induce them to pay their share. Unhappily, this never happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1959 Secretary Dulles died and was succeeded as
                        Secretary of State by Christian Herter. Did that have any effect on what we
                        did? Was Herter as interested in the UN as Dulles had been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think so. Dulles had been involved with the UN since the very
                    beginning and was far more interested in it [than Herter was]. I was beginning
                    slowly to phase myself out of UN affairs as 1959 wore on into 1960. By then I
                    had shifted over from the civil service to the Foreign Service. In fact, I think
                    that I had done that in about 1956.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved from the civil service to the Foreign Service
                        and were allowed to continue in the same position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then in 1960, I believe, you received orders to go to
                        [the American Embassy in] Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's correct. I went to Bonn. I had worked with William Tyler at the UN
                    in 1959. He was later Political Counselor in Bonn. At any rate, he knew me and
                    was willing to accept me as a member of the Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that we should put it that he was lucky enough to
                        get you. Ambassador Dowling was in Bonn at the time. What were your
                        responsibilities when you arrived in the Embassy [in Bonn]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was supposed to deal with the UN, to a degree with NATO [North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization], with Franco-German relations, and arms control issues. I
                    worked initially with Frances Williamson. I never really was as busy in the
                    Embassy in Bonn as I might have been. Toward the latter part of my tour there I
                    started writing speeches for Ambassador Dowling because Senator Henry Cabot
                    Lodge had visited the Ambassador and told him that I was “great” at speech
                    writing, since I had written speeches for him in New York. [Laughter] That was
                    sort of an interesting sidelight but not really fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can understand that. You had come out of a very hectic
                        and exciting position here [in the Department] where you had been immersed
                        for years in “pressure cooker” type situations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The difference, of course, was that the association in the UN field had
                    been at fairly senior levels, where you're likely to have more responsibility
                    than an officer gets at a post abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bonn in 1960. We had our presidential election
                        here in 1960. Did Chancellor Konrad Adenauer give any indication whether he
                        favored Nixon or Kennedy in that election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not to my recollection. You should know, although you came to Bonn a bit
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I didn't get to Bonn until 1962. In 1961 there were
                        indications, of course, of the growing Franco-German rapprochement, between
                        President De Gaulle [of France] and Adenauer. You were following that
                        closely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was following that closely and I was prepared to make my own prediction
                    that this rapprochement might be more detrimental to U. S. interests than it
                    actually turned out to be, in the event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1961 was also the year when the Wall went up in Berlin,
                        which had repercussions everywhere, and particularly in Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I'm sure that you know the famous story of the Embassy officer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't think that I do. Please tell it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the Wall went up on a Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon in Bad
                    Godesberg there was a tournament of Little League baseball teams in Europe,
                    which “everyone” was watching. In the course of the games word came to the [Code
                    Room for the ] Ambassador about the Berlin Wall, which at that point had been
                    under construction for some hours. The CBS correspondent in Bonn came up and
                    told the Ambassador [about the Wall]. It turned out that an officer from the
                    Legal Office of the Embassy had been duty officer. He had gone into the Embassy
                    and looked at the telegram from the U. S. Mission in Berlin, reporting that the
                    Wall was going up. He wrote, “Noted” on the telegram and never said a word to
                    anyone about it. So he was rather promptly transferred out of Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine Ambassador Dowling was livid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had never heard that story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Seriously?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never did. Well, in 1962 De Gaulle's visit to Bonn
                        received considerable attention. Something that I remember very well was
                        that Adenauer, under great pressure, dismissed Franz-Joseph Strauss as
                        Minister of Defense. Adenauer then promised to retire as Chancellor in 1963.
                        People found this hard to believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BROWN: There was also the visit, early on, from Secretary of State Dean Rusk. I
                    think that he was making the rounds of European capitals. I had known Rusk from
                    the very early days [of the UN] when he had initially been involved in UN
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before my time in Bonn. As I said, I arrived in
                        Bonn in the summer of 1962, just in time for some of those critical events,
                        such as the Strauss dismissal. That caused a lot of fluttering in the “hen
                        house” there [in Bonn].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then, in January, 1963, came the Franco-German treaty which was later denounced
                    by Ludwig Erhard, who was regarded as Adenauer's “Crown Prince.” There was even
                    concern, I believe—and I'd like your views on this—in the U. S. as to the
                    significance of the Franco-German treaty. Would you talk a little bit about how
                    the U. S. saw it?</p>
                <p>BROWN: As I said earlier, while this treaty was being worked on, I think that we
                    were genuinely concerned that it was going to break up the dominant position
                    that the United States had in post-war [Western] Germany. At the same time there
                    were mixed feelings on this. I think that my own view at the time, although I
                    was not the best observer, was that [the Franco-German treaty] raised more
                    problems for us. As it turned out, I think that, although enmity between France
                    and Germany had modified, the severe reactions that we had expected [did not
                    materialize].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, President Kennedy visited Germany in 1963. Were you
                        still in Bonn at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I had left. I don't recall exactly when Kennedy came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came in June, 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I left Bonn at the end of May, 1963, largely because my old office in
                    Washington, [UNP], wanted me back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then transferred back to UNP [as Deputy Director
                        of the office]. It must have seemed something like “deja vu” to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, it was “deja vu,” except that things were more difficult for me than
                    they had been in the 1950's, when we had a more or less automatic majority in
                    the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then came the assassination of President Kennedy. I am
                        told that President Johnson addressed the UN General Assembly and did fairly
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It isn't often that one gets to come back to an office where one had previously
                    served. How did you find your work different from the early 1950's?</p>
                <p>BROWN: First of all, the work was organized quite differently. UNP was an office
                    with several parts. There was a section which dealt with arms control,
                    disarmament, and outer space issues, in which, basically, IO [Bureau of
                    International Organization Affairs] was peripheral. There was another section
                    which dealt with dependent areas. Another section of UNP dealt with
                    organizational issues—slates, procedures, and the Chinese representation issue,
                    which was still with us at that time. Then there was a section dealing with
                    political issues in the Middle East, Cyprus, and the political issues in Africa.
                    I can tell you that it was an office where, every morning, you looked at the
                    cable traffic and discovered how many new subjects we had to follow. For its
                    part New York [USUN, the U. S. Mission to the UN] was also feeding in the
                    problems it had encountered on the UN circuit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a great deal of difference between the
                        operation of USUN in New York when different people took it over? You were
                        there under various U. S. Permanent Representatives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Exactly. I went from Herschel Johnson during the very early days, who was
                    a Career Ambassador; to Warren Austin, who had been a Senator from Vermont; to
                    Henry Cabot Lodge, also a Senator, from Massachusetts; and then to Adlai
                    Stevenson, a former Governor of Illinois. Then, for a good part of the time I
                    was in UNP in the 1960's, Arthur Goldberg, a former Justice of the Supreme
                    Court, was our Permanent Representative in New York.</p>
                <p>Some of these Permanent Representatives were “activists” and really wanted to run
                    the whole show. The U. S. Permanent Representatives had cabinet status. I won't
                    say that it went to their heads, but it at least gave them an independent voice
                    in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which of them was the most “activist”? Could you say or
                        were there several of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I suppose that our Permanent Representatives in the 1960's were the most
                    activist. I would have to go back and check this point. I suspect that, perhaps,
                    Goldberg was the most “activist.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Goldberg had a close relationship with
                        President Lyndon Johnson anyhow and had a pipeline to the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BROWN: Ambassador Adlai Stevenson also played a fairly active role. In the late
                    1950's I wouldn't discount Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, because he was a
                    leading Republican and had considerable influence both with his former Senate
                    colleagues and with the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Adlai Stevenson. In 1963 he was physically
                        attacked and denounced as our UN representative. Was that symptomatic of
                        sentiment arising against the UN or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think so. I think that places like Texas have always had these
                    groups. There's always been a group in the United States which has been against
                    the UN because they attributed to it power and authority which it simply does
                    not have. Today the so-called “militias” [in various states] think that the UN
                    rules and that it has troops at its disposal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964 there was the issue of UN Secretary General Kurt
                        Waldheim who was reported to have had some role in the Nazi SS organization
                        during World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think that he really did. I had known of this for a long time
                    because I had worked on arms control and disarmament issues with Waldheim and
                    the Swedish representative. I would have to go back and look [at the record on
                    this issue]. At any rate they were part of a group that was trying to find a way
                    to mediate between the U. S. and the Soviets on arms control questions. I had
                    met Waldheim and worked with him in that connection in New York. However, I must
                    say that my judgment of Waldheim related to how well he performed at that time.
                    He was not particularly outstanding. We certainly had no idea in the State
                    Department of his previous Nazi associations. I think that no one who had known
                    him as the Austrian Permanent Representative to the UN thought that he had the
                    strength to be a particularly good Secretary General. However, he was a
                    compromise candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1964 was also the year of the Goldwater campaign [for
                        president of the U. S.]. Much was said about the UN at that time—most of it
                        not very favorable. However, the organization survived. Then there was the
                        major confrontation, particularly with the Soviets, over their delay in
                        meeting their financial obligations in the UN.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The peacekeeping arrears. Now, in retrospect, with the U. S. so far in
                    arrears itself, it seems rather unique because we had one officer who spent
                    practically all of his time, with the help of a lawyer, figuring out why the
                    assessments were a treaty obligation and what could be done if a country didn't
                    pay its dues. Now the U. S. is in much the same situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Security Council expanded to 15 members in 1964. Can
                        you tell me how that came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, there had been considerable pressure for expansion to take into
                    account the new states that had come into existence since the end of World War
                    II, as well as the regions which had been basically unrepresented. There had
                    been a general understanding on how the seats should be divided up. However,
                    that meant that various regions had to rotate seats at a time when each region
                    felt that they were entitled to a representative of their own. The expansion
                    agreed to was, I would say, the minimum that met the demands of the time and
                    still did not expand the Security Council beyond a number which was workable.
                    For the Security Council to operate effectively, considerable consultations “in
                    the corridors” are needed. As the number of members rose, these contacts
                    proportionately become much more difficult to handle. We basically held the line
                    to keep the number of members at 15.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1965 there was another commemorative ceremony in San
                        Francisco. Did that have any particular significance for you,

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not really. As far as the ceremony itself was concerned, the events sort
                    of fade into the background very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1965 also brought a different vote on the Chinese
                        Communist representation issue [in the General Assembly]. The vote was 47
                        for and 47 against, which was apparently the first time that they had been
                        that close. There was much discussion as to whether membership was an
                        important question. Can you say anything about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The issue certainly had existed from the very beginning, as to whether we
                    were going to require a two-thirds majority or not. We had existed in the
                    specialized agencies [of the UN] with simple majorities where there were greater
                    pressures in many cases to bring Communist China in. They had participated with
                    a delegate to the World Health Assembly in 1965, I guess, when Chinese
                    representation didn't come up. It had been tougher to hold the line there. So,
                    while we talked about Chinese representation as an important question, I think
                    that we would have been quite reluctant to move it into that category.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: USUN had certainly liked Stevenson, and he had established a place for
                    himself in UN circles. He was a very attractive man, with a positive
                    personality. At the time I felt terribly downcast by his death, but once a

                <p>BROWN: Well, he became very interested in substantive matters. You'll have to
                    remind me of the chronology. He got awfully interested in Vietnam. I'm now

                    solutions to the continuing hostilities in Vietnam. He was a very strong-minded
                    individual. I think that he was more difficult for the State Department

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There were speeches about it, and we were criticized. We also were in a
                    bit of a dilemma because we wanted to maintain our own independence of action in
                    Vietnam. We were not interested in letting the UN [become involved] in Vietnam

                    to remember too well. There was so much going on. It was extremely difficult to
                    keep up with events. There were very strong, internal passions in the State
                    Department. At the time of the [passage of the] actual resolutions in the

                    think—and again I think that this is something that I'm going to have to look
                    up—that the resolutions which ended the fighting did not require withdrawal.
                    That had a good deal to do with personalities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli dispute has gone on the longest of

                <p>BROWN: Of course, that was at a time when sentiment throughout the U. S. in

                <p>BROWN: It played out in much the same way as it did with Hungary in 1956. This
                    was a case where many words were spoken in condemnation of the Soviet Union, but
                    the possibility of any action was just as unlikely as in 1956. It was a very

                    Republican politics. Perhaps it was out of a desire to get him out of
                    Washington. I really can't say. I'd be speculating there, I think. Goldberg,

                <p>BROWN: He was European oriented and he was in disagreement with our Vietnam

                <p>BROWN: No, I don't really think so. I'm searching my memory for any examples of
                    any big shifts but I don't think that there were any. By 1968 the UN was the
                    sort of animal which just went on, posing very similar problems to whatever
                    American administration was in office.</p>

                    I was the only woman in the Seminar. The makeup of the Seminar was extremely
                    mixed, I would say. We had an interesting time. We had a coordinator, Bert
                    Mathews, who had been edged out of his African post and who was rather
                    disaffected. However, it was a good year because it gave us time to sit back and
                    think and travel around. I found an interesting project.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I looked at the issue of “interest sections” in the Embassies of countries
                    which represented U. S. interests [in areas where we had broken diplomatic
                    relations with the host state]. At that time it included Switzerland, Spain, I
                    think the Netherlands, and the U. K. We were looking at substitute ways of
                    maintaining a diplomatic presence. It was an interesting exercise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's correct. It was sort of strange. I was initially assigned to
                    Ankara, Turkey, in the same position. I was asked to go over to NEA [Bureau of
                    Near Eastern Affairs] and told that the Ambassador in Athens had requested me
                    for assignment there. I could choose whether to go to Athens or to Ankara. I had
                    never been to Ankara. I had talked to my predecessor in Ankara about the smog in
                    winter. I had visited Athens very briefly on my way home from a conference in
                    Istanbul. After a lot of consideration, I said that I would go wherever NEA
                    wanted me to go. However, I have never known why Ambassador Henry Tasca [in
                    Athens] asked for me.</p>

                <p>BROWN: I don't know. I had known him slightly when he was a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs, but that was a very peripheral
                    acquaintanceship. I was clearing various messages with him and working on some
                    of the UN issues at that time.</p>

                <p>BROWN: About a month of very quick training, which didn't do me much good,
                    although I continued to study the Greek language in Athens.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BROWN: That's right—the days of “the colonels.” It was really my first experience
                    with a dictatorship with which we were on extremely good terms because it
                    related to [then National Security Adviser] Kissinger's approach to
                    international politics. It was very difficult because we had heard that the U.
                    S. had worked very closely with some of the old political leaders of Greece
                    associated with the governments prior to the establishment of the dictatorship.
                    We bent over backwards to get along with “the colonels.” For example, there was
                    a visit to Athens by Vice President Agnew, which was badly received in
                    democratic circles in Greece.</p>
                <p>This was my very first experience with that kind of regime. “The colonels”
                    themselves did not want to be seen as negotiating with the U. S. or appearing at
                    U. S. Embassy functions — although occasionally they did on something like July
                    4. The political section of the Embassy was permitted to deal with former
                    political leaders. When I held receptions, I would invite former members of
                    Parliament. Greek police used to stand outside the gate and would be denounced
                    by crowds standing outside. Barry King and I would stand watch and look out for
                    former Foreign Minister Averoff. We would sit outside, and Greek police would
                    stand behind some trees somewhere. We certainly couldn't have them over to
                    dinner. The Ambassador and the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] did not have any
                    contacts with these people, but I was sort of their “channel.” So I went to call
                    on the former Prime Minister. Before I arrived, there would be a policeman
                    sitting there who had come for the purpose. Anyway, it was a different kind of
                    situation and an interesting one.</p>
                <p>When I think back about Greece, I sort of wonder how “the colonels” lasted as
                    long as they did. There were two other things about Greece that were very
                    different from anything else in my Foreign Service experience. One of them was
                    the role of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] in Greece, which has been
                    pretty well described. The other was the Cyprus issue, which I had dealt with in
                    the UN and which really was practically the focal point of everything that
                    happened. Certainly, the situation in Cyprus became tougher and tougher. When
                    Archbishop Makarios died in Cyprus, the whole issue blew up, and “the colonels”
                    sort of left over night. It was the most chaotic situation I had ever seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. I had been told by some of my Greek friends — Averoff, for
                    example, had been coming to my house nearly every night. He had been telling me
                    that at any moment the whole situation was going to blow up in the faces of “the
                    colonels.” Papadopoulos was going to be pushed out. I never expected things to
                    happen as fast as they did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was your political section [in Athens]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BROWN: I had a total of six officers, two of whom were nominally “mine” but also
                    worked for CIA. Then I had three other people who were foreign nationals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of them Greek speaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Two of them were. One of them worked for CIA and one for a political
                    officer. The language was not a great problem, because most of the Greek
                    diplomats and most of the Greek political people spoke fluent English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when a bomb exploded in a parking lot and
                        killed two people in the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I didn't think too much about it. I had just had two visitors from
                    the United States who had gone off sightseeing. I had told them what a calm and
                    polite place Athens was. They came back to the Embassy in the late afternoon,
                    joining up with me to drive back to my residence. They couldn't get anywhere
                    near the Embassy because the bomb had gone off. Everyone said that the dead were
                    a man and a woman. She had dropped the bomb at the crucial moment and blew up
                    both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Papadopoulos government have much or any popular
                        support, in your view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that it had some popular support because the economy was
                    reasonably good. There had been a difficult time previously, but if you talked
                    to any of the better-educated Greeks, they were very upset about “the colonels.”
                    We had a visit from Secretary of State William Rogers when I was there and, as I
                    said before, from Vice President Agnew. They showed that the United States was
                    with “the colonels.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there differences within the Embassy regarding our

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There were certainly differences between the Foreign Service, if I can put
                    it that way, and the CIA Station.</p>

                <p>BROWN: While we still had a Military Assistance Mission there, they thought that
                    the Greeks were an asset to us. They equated that with stability, which they
                    thought “the colonels” brought. On the other hand they were quick to react when
                    the situation started falling apart. And it fell apart fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you had a visit in 1971 from Jim Lowenstein and Dick
                        Moose, who wrote a report for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which
                        was quite critical of the Embassy's attitude in this whole situation [in
                        Greece].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: First of all, those were the days when we were supposed to be extremely
                    nice to “the colonels.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though we'd had an embargo on shipping weapons to
                        them? This was rather confusing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was very confusing. I never thought that I would get into such a
                    mixed-up situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about view within the Embassy. Were there
                        differences between the way the Embassy viewed the situation and the way
                        Washington viewed it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Certainly, I think that the Ambassador and Washington were together on the
                    policy line of maintaining a stable Greece with this dictatorship [in power]. At
                    the same time, I think that the Embassy thought—I certainly did—that it was
                    desirable to avoid totally discouraging the figures in the former political
                    world, because everybody believed that, sooner or later, “the colonels” were
                    going to vanish from the scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1972 you began something called the “Home Port
                        Negotiations.” Could you explain that a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BROWN: I think that that was one of the mistakes made by the United States Navy
                    under Admiral Zumwalt [then Chief of Naval Operations]. He visited Athens and
                    felt that it was a lovely place to live. He felt that it had a very equable
                    climate. He thought that he could “home port” a large proportion of the U. S.
                    Navy [Sixth Fleet] there, bring the families over to this very lovely,
                    Mediterranean environment, and everybody would be happy because they had their
                    families with them. It turned out that the Navy, which brought in some part of
                    the normal infrastructure to support the “home porting,” found that it didn't
                    work at all. Of course, those who were against “the colonels” were absolutely
                    appalled. So we thought—I should say, the Navy thought—that we needed a bigger
                    naval presence in the Mediterranean. It certainly did not work [in terms of
                    “home porting” in Athens].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The families never came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A few families came. The Navy set up a medical facility there. The Navy
                    unfortunately picked a small community to put these young wives in, who had to
                    deal with a foreign language and a foreign culture. Naturally, it didn't work
                    out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period was there any anti-American feeling in
                        Greece which you sensed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There was some. But there had been such a long, family type relationship
                    [between Americans and Greeks] that, even the Greeks opposed to “the colonels”
                    thought that, in the long run, the U. S. would turn out to be helpful to
                    Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you invited to go around and speak in various places?
                        Was that common in Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. There are no organizations in Greece which do that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the later years that you were there, there was a
                        good deal of student unrest and protests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. The student unrest was related to the Cyprus crisis, as I
                    recall. This crisis led to the demise of the Papadopoulos government. At the
                    time the student unrest was described by CIA as inspired by leftists and
                    provocateurs. In the event this turned out not to be the case.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BROWN: It was genuine concern over the prevailing political atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they did away with the monarchy, so King Constantine
                        couldn't come back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the monarchy had been done away with before I arrived in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. But they proclaimed a republic. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. But that all happened in the late 1960's. At this point the issue was
                    strictly the government of “the colonels.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly “the colonels.” Did Greece have a republican
                        government at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, it was a republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Papadopoulos was elected president and was later
                        thrown out of office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. He was tossed out by his own colleagues. The situation became very
                    dicey. I had Greek friends who told me that, “any day now, 'the colonels' will
                    be gone.” And, in point of fact, they did go—almost overnight. Certainly, we
                    never expected it to happen as fast as it did. And the night when Karamanlis
                    came back to Greece was pretty wild. In the meantime, before he came back, the
                    Army had had the tanks out in the streets. There was a curfew. It was a very
                    difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were ever in any physical danger at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I don't know. We took different routes to get to the Embassy to
                    avoid the tanks and so forth. Athens is a city where you can cut off the center
                    with no difficulty and with a very light force. We all lived in the suburbs, so
                    it was not a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been an extremely busy period for the

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was a very busy period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Ambassador agree fully with what you were

                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BROWN: I think that the Ambassador agreed with us. We were reporting cautiously,
                    I think. I don't know whether we could have done more than we did, although I
                    don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then came the problems on Cyprus, to add to all this, with
                        the Turks moving [into northern Cyprus] in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That brought an end to the government of “the colonels.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the Greeks withdrew from NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They did briefly. Everything happened so fast. I've been over this period
                    with various people. Each time I think it through, I just can't imagine that
                    things happened as fast as they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that that was the time when Ambassador Rodger
                        Davies was killed in Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He was killed before then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he killed in 1974?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I think that he was killed in 1972 or early 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that I was at the Embassy in Copenhagen when it

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It all added to the mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you had a change of ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we did. It happened very quickly. This account may have to be
                    reconsidered or edited out. As the fighting increased between the Greeks and the
                    Turks, the situation became so dicey that the Ambassador, acting on his own
                    responsibility, sent some very overblown messages to such people as our
                    Ambassador to NATO and to the commanding general of NATO, asking for NATO
                    intervention. When those cables—which neither the DCM nor I knew about—hit
                    Washington, Secretary of State Kissinger became very irate. Early one morning,
                    about 2:00 AM, when I was the Acting DCM, the communications people called me up
                    and said that they had received a cable for the Ambassador and would I come into
                    the office. So I went to the Embassy at around 4:00 AM and took this cable to
                    Ambassador Henry Tasca. He opened it up, read it, and threw it at me. The cable
                    recalled him as Ambassador to Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have seen speculation that his recall followed a visit
                        by Assistant Secretary Joe Sisco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I don't think...Joe had come to Athens in the hope that we could
                    prevent hostilities from taking place. He had left Athens before hostilities had
                    actually broken out. His visit really had nothing to do with Ambassador Henry
                    Tasca's departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather not, from your story. Was there any increase at
                        that time of anti-American sentiment in Greece, or did that play...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, there really wasn't any anti-American sentiment. Everything happened
                    very quickly. “The colonels” were there one day, and the next day, they were
                    gone. Karamanlis came back. The people we had been dealing with came back into
                    power. Averoff, for example, became the Minister of Defense.</p>
                <p>Whatever was uncertain about the turn that events had taken, Secretary of State
                    Kissinger was certain about one thing. He wanted a stable Greece. He wanted to
                    have a stable Greece and to avoid an outbreak of hostilities between Greece and
                    Turkey. The Embassy's role was cut away back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that include the CIA role, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BROWN: That included the Agency's role, as well. I have to go back a bit on what
                    was said. You see, there was a period of roughly two months after democracy had
                    returned to Greece, so to speak. We were dealing with the former Greek political
                    world. Ambassador Tasca was meeting with Karamanlis—usually in the late
                    afternoons and sometimes in the evenings. Sometimes I went with him, sometimes I
                    didn't. The Greeks were appealing for help because they thought that the Turks
                    were going to attack them. I think that this is what led Ambassador Tasca to
                    send those rather extreme messages. It was a very complicated period, and a
                    whole lot of things were going on at the same time. There were people in the
                    State Department who thought that the Embassy in Athens could have done more
                    than it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, that we could have persuaded the Greeks to keep out of Cyprus. I
                    don't think that this was realistic. However, there were so many irons in the
                    fire at this time, including Washington, Nicosia, Ankara, and Athens. There was
                    an unstable situation in Greece. Anything could have happened, and maybe the way
                    it turned out was all for the better. [To replace Ambassador Tasca], we got an
                    Ambassador, Jack Kubisch, who had never had anything to do with Greece before.
                    Fortunately, the DCM was an old Greek hand. By then I was ready to leave Athens
                    anyway, as my tour was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had five, action-filled years [in Athens].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Four and one-half years. That was long enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had plenty of action in that regard. Did you become
                        involved in the bases talks we had with the Greeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We had a military affairs, POL-MIL [Political and Military Affairs]
                    officer. We worked together, though not to any great extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those things are usually handled by a combination of
                        military and political people, anyhow. Were you there when Richard Welch
                        [the CIA Chief of Station] was killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BROWN: No. The Chief of Station while I was there was Jim Potts, who had a close
                    relationship with “the colonels.” One of the first social events I went to in
                    Athens was at his home. Three of “the colonels” were fellow guests. Ambassador
                    Tasca came and subsequently read the riot act to Potts. He told him that he was
                    not to invite such people. He was succeeded by Stacy Hulse, who came very
                    briefly toward the end [of my time in Athens]. Richard Welch came
                    subsequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1975, then, you were transferred to The Hague [the
                        Netherlands], which was a change of pace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A real change of pace. Since you served in The Hague yourself, you know
                    that the situation is relatively tranquil there. Dutch diplomats not only are
                    very approachable but, like the Greeks, they tell you what they think. It was a
                    very tranquil period, I would say, without any major issues to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about issues, what about the stories about payoffs
                        to Prince Bernhard by Lockheed and Northrop? Did these stories cause a great
                        to-do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There was a certain amount of interest in the subject, but there was no
                    great to-do. I think that a more exciting event for us were the South Moluccan
                    takeover of the French Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little bit about the South Moluccans—who they
                        are, what they were doing, and how...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: When Indonesia became independent [in 1949], the South Moluccas was
                    something I dealt with in the UN context, when the hawks in the Bureau of Far
                    Eastern Affairs thought the South Moluccas should have been independent. That
                    was years before, and I never expected to hear of the South Moluccas again.
                    Anyway, they had been loyal Dutch subjects. I don't think that they ever gave up
                    the thought that they would eventually become independent. I arrived in The
                    Hague after the time when they had taken over the French Embassy, but I was
                    there when they took over a department store in Amsterdam and for the train
                    incident.</p>
                <p>This was interesting. I discovered that the Agency had all sort of fascinating
                    techniques like putting listening devices in trays of food and what not. That
                    was about the most exciting thing that happened [to me in The Hague].</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the Agency, it was during your period there
                        that Phillip Agee lost his residence permit in Amsterdam and was kicked out
                        of the country. He'd been a thorn in the side of the Agency for some time, I
                        know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I think so. For me service in The Hague was kind of a nice change. I
                    don't know what your experience was, but the people in the Agency in The Hague
                    [during my time there] were much more open and cooperative than had been the
                    case in Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. That tour in Holland was interesting because it also
                        gave you a chance to “test your wings” as a DCM, which is always an
                        interesting position. Tell me a little about that—how the Embassy
                        functioned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was an interesting Embassy because the Ambassador during most of my
                    tour was Kingdon Gould, Jr., whose interest in the political scene in the
                    Netherlands was somewhat limited. He really left it to the Political Counselor,
                    Martin van Heuven, and me to do most of the substantive work. In fact, he was
                    absent from the Embassy a good deal of the time. A good example of this is that
                    when Secretary of State Kissinger came to the Netherlands, the Ambassador hadn't
                    been in the Embassy for a month or so. He came back for one day and then left
                    with Kissinger, whose visit was extremely interesting. I don't know whether you
                    experienced anything like this, but Kissinger absolutely sought to cut the
                    Embassy out of everything except one luncheon. He told the Dutch, who ignored
                    what he had said, that they shouldn't share the discussions that they had had
                    [with him] with the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience in Israel when I was there.
                        That's a difficult situation in which to work, when your own Secretary of
                        State is doing things that you don't know about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Exactly. I'm sure that it was much worse in Israel. Actually, the issues
                    we had with the Dutch were not the kind of matters which were that difficult.
                    There really weren't any great political issues that came up during my tour in
                    the Netherlands. We had a rather difficult battle over whether to close down the
                    Consulate General in Rotterdam. We had a crisis when the Maytag people, who ran
                    an outlet store, came into Amsterdam and sold their merchandise cut rate. We had
                    a lot of stranded tourists there.</p>
                <p>During my tour we had a change of Ambassador, when Bob McCloskey was assigned.
                    This gave me an opportunity to see the difference between presenting credentials
                    in Greece, with much military fanfare, as had been the case when we had a new
                    Ambassador in Greece, and that quiet visit down in the country [in the
                    Netherlands] which Bob McCloskey and I made to see the Queen [of the
                    Netherlands]. Ambassador McCloskey had a limousine [and a driver]. Period.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a more relaxed atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A very relaxed atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that you and Bob worked very well together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. I enjoyed serving with him. Then, at the very end of my tour [in the
                    Netherlands] another new Ambassador came, but he was really there just to “meet
                    and greet.” That was it. You had him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had Geri Joseph, yes, and a very fine Ambassador, too.
                        Then you were assigned as a Senior Inspector. Tell me about that assignment.
                        How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was supposed to be assigned to another job, as you may have heard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a senior job, as a matter of fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I've never really known what happened, because I was never able to find
                    out why. For some reason the assignment was changed at the last moment, and
                    George Vest, the Director General of the Foreign Service, apparently could not
                    tell me why, except that Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher apparently had
                    gotten into the personnel machinery and shaken things up.</p>
                <p>So I ended up as a Senior Inspector, which was a perfectly reasonable assignment.
                    I worked with an old, former colleague of mine in inspecting the Bureau of
                    Public Affairs in the State Department. It was then under Assistant Secretary of
                    State Hodding Carter. This was a quite interesting assignment. I can't say that
                    we did anything great, except that we encountered some practices with contract
                    employees in the Historical Office of the State Department which were of a
                    somewhat dubious nature.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting experience. After that I retired quite happily and managed
                    to find a good many things to keep me fully occupied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the inspection function is really
                        necessary, now that we've gone through a great retrenchment in the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BROWN: I suspect that it's necessary because it does occasionally uncover some
                    problems. I'm not sure that it needs the extensive kind of effort that is made.
                    In terms of my own experience with inspections, I've been inspected both in the
                    State Department, in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, and in
                    the Netherlands. We were never inspected [during my time] in Greece, when there
                    might have been more reason for it than we wanted. I'm not sure that anything
                    terribly constructive came out of any of these inspections. However, in the
                    Netherlands the inspection was helpful to Political Counselor van Heuven and me
                    because we had been extremely hard on a junior officer. The inspectors thought
                    that there was no reason for us to have been more lenient with this officer than
                    they were. In a subsequent grievance case, it was a nice thing to have the
                    Foreign Service inspectors on our side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, looking back on it, your career was unique
                        because you saw things both from the civil service, the Foreign Service, the
                        Department side, and the field side. Could you say a few words about how
                        your perspective differs when you're in one place or another or—how will I
                        say it—when you're almost in a different system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that I was extremely fortunate because my initial years with the
                    State Department brought me into contact from the very outset with people I
                    would otherwise never have known—including Secretary of State John Foster
                    Dulles. I knew him [personally] by the time he was Secretary of State. The
                    associations with Senators and Congressmen whom I met in our General Assembly
                    Delegations and other prominent Americans in our Delegations [were extremely
                    interesting]. In New York [my contacts with] senior diplomats were truly unique
                    in a Foreign Service career. Once you move into the more normal, diplomatic work
                    in an Embassy, your opportunities are not nearly as great. I was very fortunate
                    because, both during my career in the Department and subsequently in Athens, I
                    was pulled off to go to international conferences which we haven't talked about
                    at all. However, they were also fascinating experiences.</p>
                <p>For instance, in 1964, I went to the conference of the Universal Postal Union in
                    Vienna with a lawyer from the Office of the Legal Adviser [of the State
                    Department]. The Universal Postal Union tried to throw out the South Africans.
                    We went to work on that issue. It was one of the most fascinating experiences I
                    ever had. I had to enlist the assistance of our Ambassador, James Riddleberger,
                    to protect my legal adviser when I needed him. It was really one of my most
                    exciting experiences. I want to discuss my experience with the international
                    organization of the Red Cross [International Committee of the Red Cross—ICRC].
                    This is a totally different area to deal with, at a different level. This was an
                    unusual experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were pulled out from Athens to go to conferences
                        like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BROWN: I went to Athens and then went to Rome for almost two months to a
                    conference of the International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO], designed to
                    stop hijacking of civil aircraft. It was a very interesting meeting, but not
                    terribly productive. It's always nice to be in Rome. It was a nice change.</p>
                <p>I think that my international organization experience really was, in many
                    respects, the high point of my career. However, I would not have exchanged that
                    for my experiences in Athens or in The Hague, either. All of my posts were
                    interesting, and the contexts were fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your years of service you've seen the position of
                        women in the Department and the Foreign Service evolve. Can you say a little
                        about that? Is there a “glass ceiling” that we read about for women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I don't know. I think that I was extremely fortunate because I was
                    initially in an area where I wasn't directly competitive with the Foreign
                    Service. At the same time, before I moved from the civil service to the Foreign
                    Service, I had spoken to the Director of my office about moving ahead and so on.
                    I was told, rather abruptly, as was the other woman in the office, that because
                    we were not married and did not have families, we didn't need any more money, we
                    didn't need to be promoted, and so forth. This was a little tough to take. On
                    the other hand, I think that the fact that I was in a non-traditional area
                    helped me, because I did move ahead quite rapidly—even after I went into the
                    Foreign Service. I went to Bonn as First Secretary. I was promoted while I was
                    in Bonn and promoted again when I returned to Washington. I don't know that it
                    was at all meaningful, but I was fortunate enough to be nominated and then
                    selected for the Woman's Award, which no longer exists. I was given this award
                    strictly on the basis of my UN experience.</p>
                <p>I think that today it's easier for a woman to move up in the ranks. I still think
                    that it's perhaps a bit more difficult [than for a man].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking back, would you today recommend a Foreign

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BROWN: I would, but I think that they would have to be prepared for a lot of
                    frustration and difficulty. Frankly, I remember the young people I have talked
                    to at the college level who were fairly interested in international affairs.
                    They seemed to have no interest in the Foreign Service. I met some students who
                    were candidates for graduate scholarships which DACOR [Diplomatic and Consular
                    Officers, Retired, an organization of retired Foreign Service people] gives.
                    There were about six of them, from both George Washington and Georgetown
                    Universities. I asked them if they were interested in the Foreign Service. They
                    were interested in economic development and in international corporations and so
                    forth, [but not the Foreign Service]. At the moment, of course, the Foreign
                    Service is pretty much closed [because of personnel limitations]. However, I'm
                    afraid that there isn't too much interest in it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That doesn't bode well for the future, because if we don't
                        have that life blood coming along—and this interest—we'll suffer in the long
                        run.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think so. But who is to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, any final comments that you'd like to make about
                        your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Only that I liked every minute of it—even some of the difficult times. I
                    have some regrets—particularly about Athens in terms of the limitations on our
                    work, largely because of the activities of the Agency. I wouldn't exchange it
                    for a different career. I would recommend the Foreign Service and I did
                    recommend it to some of these graduate students to whom I referred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much, Elizabeth. It's been a
                        pleasure, as always, to talk to you.</hi>
