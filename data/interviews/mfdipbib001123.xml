                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Joseph F. Stepanek on December
                        29, 1997. Joe, why don't you start off this interview by telling us where
                        you're from, where you grew up, and something about your early
                        education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Thanks, Haven. I'm pleased to plunge in with my background which, for
                    me, explains a great deal about why I went to work for USAID [Agency for
                    International Development] and how I saw USAID as a remarkable opportunity and
                    career.</p>
                <p>I was born in Houston, TX, on December 12, 1943. My father failed the military
                    health exam during World War II and ended up as a chemical engineer, designing
                    gasoline refineries outside of Houston. Obviously, we needed gasoline for the
                    war. While earning his Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering at Yale, he learned
                    about China from the establishment of the “Yale in China” program. Prior to
                    attending Yale University, he attended the University of Colorado, where he was
                    very active in the Cosmopolitan Club, which I think was his first introduction
                    to international students and international issues.</p>
                <p>Right after World War II my father applied for a job with UNRRA [United Nations
                    Relief and Rehabilitation Administration], the United Nations program in China.
                    He got the job and in 1946 left for China, initially leaving his family in
                    Boulder, CO, where we had moved. My family and I eventually followed him to
                    China, where we lived in the small town of Shaoyang in Hunan Province, where my
                    father was a technical adviser for what was, in effect, a Chinese Nationalist
                    industrial and agricultural “commune” for the production of all kinds of
                    equipment and inputs needed by farmers in the surrounding area.</p>
                <p>That tour “wedded” my family to the international life. After that assignment, my
                    father joined the United Nations Technical Assistance Program in Jakarta and
                    taught many of the Indonesian students who are now the “big names” in the
                    Indonesian Government. We lived in Jakarta from 1951-1953.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>From Jakarta we moved to Burma, where my father again worked for the UN. From
                    Burma we moved to India in the very late 1950's. This time my father was working
                    for the Ford Foundation. My schooling reflected this vagabond lifestyle. I
                    really had no formal education in the elementary grades. I started kindergarten
                    by correspondence from China. There were no schools for English- speaking
                    students in Jakarta, so my mother started what has become the largest,
                    international school of its kind. This school began to function in three, very
                    hot garages. I was the first student. During other overseas assignments in Burma
                    and in India, I took correspondence courses. After our assignment to India I
                    managed to be accepted at Yale University, where my father, uncle, and
                    grandfather had studied. Quite frankly, I was promptly “bounced” out of Yale. I
                    simply didn't have the study skills and habits needed to survive that kind of
                    disciplined approach.</p>
                <p>At the time, like most kids, I was worrying about college, a career, and a
                    family. I remember feeling a great sense of turmoil and uncertainty as to what I
                    might do over the long term. I recall that, during my student years, my father
                    thought that I might get into development administration. I didn't realize then
                    how right he would turn out to be.</p>
                <p>At the University of Colorado I received a B. A. degree in economics in 1965.
                    Then I went to the University of Minnesota, where I received an M. A. degree in
                    1967, again in economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You majored in economics throughout your college
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: My B.A., M.A., and Ph. D. degrees were all in economics. After two
                    years at the University of Minnesota, where I earned an M.A., I went back to the
                    University of Colorado at Boulder, CO. I majored in economics and took minors in
                    anthropology, sociology, and political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular aspect of economics that you were
                        interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I was interested in development and agricultural economics. My
                    undergraduate degree was in general economic studies. As luck would have it, and
                    I seemed to have my share of luck, my professor in the course, “Principles of
                    Economics,” was Rubin Zubrow, who died recently. Alice Rivlin, Director of the
                    Officer of Management and Budget in Washington, DC, now with the Federal Reserve
                    Bank, was also in classes under Professor Zubrow. Zubrow drew a lot of students
                    into economics. From that point forward I majored in economics, despite years of
                    uncertainty as to what I would actually focus on.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So my course was set. I eventually taught a course called, “Principles of
                    Economics.” I also taught this course to minority students in Colorado as well
                    as students drawn from the general student population. That teaching experience
                    convinced me that I wanted to teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you concentrate on in your thesis in the Ph. D.
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: My thesis concerned the beginning of India's “Green Revolution” under
                    the guidance of the Indian Government in the late 1950's and the early 1960's,
                    of course, with the involvement of USAID and the Rockefeller Foundation. I
                    hadn't realized the degree to which I would be involved in “Green Revolution”
                    work later on in USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that the “Green Revolution” was just getting
                        started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was just getting started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the theme of your dissertation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I considered statistical data on the growth rates of new seeds and how
                    their early successes were being shared and documented. It was very hard to
                    obtain such data in Boulder, CO, but I managed to get enough to convince my
                    faculty committee that I had enough to say in my dissertation so that I was
                    awarded a Ph. D.</p>
                <p>I survived the experience of obtaining a Ph. D. degree. It wasn't entirely
                    pleasant but I survived, in large degree, because of my father's push over a
                    period of a decade, which it took to get through the entire college-university
                    program. I met my wife, Caroline at the University of Colorado. We were married
                    in 1967 and went off to Mexico.</p>
                <p>I was very anxious to teach because of the teaching I had done as an economics
                    instructor at the University of Colorado. However, in 1970-1971 there simply
                    were no teaching jobs available. I still have a file with about 30 applications
                    for teaching jobs. There were just no jobs available.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Because of an assignment to Vietnam during the summer of 1966, the USDA [U.S.
                    Department of Agriculture] had my name in its files and wanted to recruit me for
                    a long-term career position. So USDA paid for my ticket back to Washington, DC,
                    in the spring of 1971. The USDA interviewed me three times in all. This was
                    broken up by the Vietnam War, of course. Had I accepted an assignment to
                    Vietnam, Caroline would have had to live in Bangkok or some other, nearby post,
                    as families were not accepted in Vietnam because of the war. I didn't see the
                    point of programming food aid. I was a cynic then with respect to our motives in
                    Vietnam. I've been a “worry wart” over the effectiveness of food aid ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I took advantage of the trip to Washington to look around for
                    other jobs. I knew a little bit about USAID. I had no names to refer to and no
                    appointments. I simply decided to walk across the Mall from my last appointment
                    at USDA and started knocking on doors in AID. I think that this was in April or
                    May of 1971.</p>
                <p>I ran into Paul Eisenman, who was then the USAID desk officer for India. I
                    remember vividly Paul saying, more to friends than to me: “T. Swayze is looking
                    for an economist. Go see T.” I found T. on the Pakistan desk of USAID. After an
                    interview that lasted no more than four minutes T. said: “You're it.” Five
                    months went by during a federal personnel “freeze,” the security checks, and all
                    the rest of it. Then we found ourselves headed to Washington to work for USAID
                    in a career which I hadn't been looking for.</p>
                <p>Joined USAID Asia Bureau as economist and assigned to Bangladesh - 1971/72</p>
                <p>It didn't take me long to realize that this was exactly what my background
                    suggested that I would be good at. I spent a year with T. Swayze and Walter
                    Bollinger, Ann Demscar, Herb Rees, Al White, and Don McDonald.</p>
                <p>It was right during that period, of course, that Bangladesh was being born as a
                    separate country. First there was a cyclone, followed by humanitarian
                    assistance. Secretary of State Kissinger tilted towards Pakistan during
                    Bangladesh's struggle for independence. This was followed by the establishment
                    of an USAID program in Bangladesh, which was a successor to the previous USAID
                    program that had been implemented in the unified country of Pakistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I remember vividly observing Herb Rees as he built the program. Herb considered
                    himself the Mission Director, and quite understandably so. He assigned Tony
                    Schwarzwalder to be the first Mission Director in Bangladesh. Herb had his own
                    list of favorite economists. First one, and then another, turned Herb down.
                    Maybe they knew Dhaka and knew what a difficult place it could or would be to
                    live and work in. On the third try another economist went out to Dhaka to look
                    at the job. I won't mention his name, but when he was leaving Dhaka, a
                    Bangladeshi customs official saw that he was leaving the country with brand new
                    currency notes. Rather than turn the currency in at the bank window or hand it
                    over to this customs official, this USAID employee tore up the currency in front
                    of this official. At this point the USAID officer was asked to stay in a hotel
                    for a little while until his permanent departure could be arranged.</p>
                <p>When I heard of this third rejection of an economist, I went to Herb Rees and
                    said: “All right, Herb, it's my turn now.” Herb said: “Yes, we'll give you a
                    chance.” I think that he said something to the effect that, “You're young and
                    don't know anything, but we'll give it a try.” So off we went to Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>To conclude this part of the story, we served five years in Bangladesh and then
                    four years in Jakarta. For me, of course, service in Jakarta was a return, since
                    I had been there previously with my parents. Then my wife and I spent four years
                    in Nairobi, Kenya, where I became a Program Officer. I had given up being a
                    Program Economist. Then I was USAID Representative and Mission Director in
                    Tanzania for four years, followed by two years in Zambia as Mission Director. I
                    retired from USAID just over a year ago [September 1996].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OKAY, let's go back to this first assignment in
                        Bangladesh. What was the situation when you arrived there? This was in
                        1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was in late 1972, one year after I went to work for USAID. We served
                    in Bangladesh from 1972 to 1977. We knew that we were going to be involved in a
                    very large, humanitarian relief effort, involving mostly food aid. We were
                    picking up after a major cyclone and the dislocations of the struggle for
                    Bangladeshi independence from Pakistan. Food prices were relatively high. There
                    was a famine in 1975. There was great concern about what effect this food aid
                    was going to have on Bangladesh. Bangladesh was known historically as “Golden
                    Bengal,” and there were questions about why Bangladesh couldn't grow its own
                    food, since it was supposed to be so fertile.</p>
                <p>So we did “double duty.” We administered food aid. We also began to talk to the
                    Bangladeshis and officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary
                    Fund about stimulating agricultural production. With the benefit of hindsight we
                    seem to have made a contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects or programs were you promoting at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The major projects at the time were providing food to obtain resources
                    for budget support. We used these resources as leverage to try to stimulate
                    agriculture and the “Green Revolution.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this food provided under Title I of the PL 480
                        law?</hi>

                <p>STEPANEK: It was Title I food aid, which later became Title III assistance. There
                    was an element of Title II food aid as well. For some time I think that we were
                    providing assistance under all three Titles of the PL 480 law.</p>
                <p>Title II food was used in the “Food for Work” Program. This fit in with an old
                    tradition in East Pakistan and then Bangladesh. Title I assistance was used to
                    serve the urban middle class. The food under this Title was sold initially at a
                    large subsidy, but gradually those subsidies were reduced. Food prices were
                    allowed to rise to foster the “Green Revolution” in the hands of the Bangladeshi
                    cultivators. Along with other aid donors we helped the Bangladeshi Government to
                    stimulate seed testing and distribution. We also helped to introduce wheat as a
                    winter crop, which was sold in urban centers to help to moderate rice price
                    increases.</p>
                <p>We had a major family planning program. Joe Toner was heroic in his efforts to
                    convince the Bangladeshis that they should be growing their own food and also
                    limiting their numbers. In conjunction with Jack Sullivan he was also
                    instrumental in helping to privatize the fertilizer business. So, in a nutshell,
                    we were promoting privatization and structural adjustment long before these
                    terms were even invented.</p>
                <p>For various reasons the Bangladeshi Government went along, somewhat begrudgingly,
                    with this general reorientation of the agricultural economy. The Bangladeshi
                    Government, like many governments in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent, was
                    a firm believer in public administration and planning, as well as state control
                    of the economy. Then we happened along. The independence struggle took place at
                    a period when people were starting to “re-think” this “statist” approach to
                    development. For budgetary reasons and because of aid donor pressure, and also,
                    I think, because Bangladesh was filled with bright civil servants, all of these
                    forces came together at a time which allowed, stimulated, and encouraged a very
                    major shift in their thinking.</p>
                <p>With the benefit now of data from the mid 1990's we know that Bangladesh is
                    approaching food grain self sufficiency. We know that family planning is taking
                    hold most dramatically. We know that jute fiber is no longer the sole foreign
                    exchange earner. Other things are blossoming. So it's an exciting picture.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>At the time we used to say several things, partly in jest. We knew that many of
                    us were young and inexperienced, yet we had no choice but to work hard and to be
                    risk takers. We commented frequently, first with Tony and then with Joe Toner,
                    that we “looked forward to looking back,” so that we would have the benefit of
                    hindsight to see what we were really doing. We also realized that food aid would
                    simply “grow more people.” In retrospect, I think that food aid and food for
                    development, as we coined the phrase then, helped to increase confidence that
                    the government could, in fact, be stable, could feed its own people, and that
                    Bangladeshi cultivators could feed the country. So despite the fact that, during
                    those early years, outside experts were saying, “Triage,” “Hopeless, hopeless,”
                    and so on, the truth of the matter is somewhat more complex than just sheer
                    pessimism. There is no doubt that Bangladesh faces severe problems and that the
                    population has grown. At the time of my arrival there the population of
                    Bangladesh was around 72 million. Now, it is almost 130 million. This is a
                    staggering increase. However, from my point of view, it illustrates the “right
                    mindedness” of tough policies, of market-oriented policies, and also of an USAID
                    presence. This contribution by the American people could not have been made by
                    flying in experts, by a “hands off” attitude, or by saying: “It's a poor
                    country. We're going to 'dump' food aid. Why worry about it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the things that you were specifically
                        responsible for? So far we have been talking in general terms. What did you
                        mostly work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I worked as a Mission economist, so I had a hand in most of the
                    projects and programs. However, almost all of my time and most of my energy went
                    into the programming of food aid for development. I looked at the conditions of
                    every agreement with Bangladesh. My colleague and I, Nizamuddin Ahmed, visited
                    the countryside once a month for five years. We knew what the “Green Revolution”
                    looked like up close. We talked to Bangladeshi cultivators, to tenant farmers,
                    to laborers. We tried to learn as much as we possibly could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: He was a junior FSN [Foreign Service National] employee of the USAID
                    Mission at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand. He was a Mission staff member.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. He had been wounded during the “war of liberation.” USAID
                    had hired him as a dispatcher for the Motor Pool. I asked Nizam one morning if
                    he would mind going out to the market and collecting price data for me. He did
                    such a good job that it was obvious to me that he was in the wrong job. So away
                    we went, out into the countryside. Nizam was instrumental in helping the USAID
                    Mission to understand rural agricultural Bangladesh in all of its complexities,
                    including its vocabulary, terms and conditions of old and new seed, and all of
                    that. That considerable early contribution made it possible for AID and the
                    Embassy, and then the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the other
                    aid donors, to understand the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working with any counterparts from the
                        Bangladeshi Government in this effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We worked with the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Food. Some
                    of those colleagues have since died. L.R. Khan was a close friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them to work with at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: They were a pleasure to talk to. The Bengalis are quite skilled in the
                    verbal arts. Most of those I met were Western educated. I personally had many
                    good conversations with them. I was dealing with technocrats, of course, who, in
                    turn, faced their own political difficulties. So there was a lot of “to-ing and
                    fro-ing, backsliding, and frustrations.”</p>
                <p>There was some suspicion of our motives. Just as we became concerned about
                    corruption in food grains, they became concerned about whether they could rely
                    on us. The Bangladeshis are terribly concerned about stability, and that meant
                    food for the cities. Therefore, for many years the priority was food aid, more
                    or less at any cost. At the time the Western aid donors had a lot of food aid to
                    disburse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was highly subsidized, I suppose, in the
                        cities.STEPANEK: It was, right. There were great “leakages” out of the food
                        system. There were great incentives to steal a bag of food or a ration card,
                        to divert a truck, or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you said that you gradually reduced the corruption.
                        Were you involved in bringing that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, I worked on that. That was part of the “package.” We worked on
                    subsidies, first for food grains, and then for fertilizer and irrigation
                    equipment. Much of that is now privatized, though I wouldn't say that this has
                    been done entirely. I had a chance, when I came back to Bangladesh from home
                    leave in the United States, to write a book about my Bangladesh experience. Herb
                    Rees and then Joe Toner let me use my free time, such as it was, to put a book
                    together. Pergamon Press published that book in 1979. Chapter IV of the book
                    that I am writing now is devoted to a perspective on this period. In writing it
                    I had the advantage of my own hindsights and my own notes. Also, a number of
                    USAID people have published papers, and I've been able to draw on those
                    documents as well to explain what we thought we were doing, what we think we
                    did, and what problems Bangladesh faces today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We need to make a citation in this document so that people
                        can refer to these papers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I'd be happy to do that. [See IFPRI studies, and documents by Daniel
                    Atwood and Donald McClelland.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role and how did you go about trying to
                        reduce subsidies and all of that? Did you have any particular approach to it
                        or any procedure that you followed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: On the food subsidies it was more a matter of vision than the “brass
                    tacks” of the budget. I didn't appreciate this at the time, but when Bangladesh
                    gained its independence, it inherited a considerable debt from the World Bank
                    and the International Monetary Fund. This was its portion of the debt owed by a
                    united Pakistan. Because of that debt and budget pressures the Bangladesh
                    Government knew that it could not afford to subsidize food, clothes,
                    fertilizers, irrigation equipment, or pesticides to any great extent. So they
                    were under constant pressure in this regard. Every visit by missions from the
                    World Bank or the International Monetary Fund [IMF] emphasized that pressure.
                    The World Bank and the IMF emphasized that the Bangladeshi Government simply had
                    to generate revenue, cut subsidies, and balance the books, if you will. This was
                    an old story. The USAID Mission, in a sense, benefitted from that pressure. It
                    made people in the Bangladeshi Government, who otherwise didn't care about the
                    Bangladeshi farmers, appreciate the fact that it needed to stimulate domestic
                    food production. It needed to make sure that purchasing power benefitted
                    Bangladeshi cultivators instead of American cultivators.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So, quite frankly, the “conversation” with the Bangladeshi Government was really
                    about a “dream.” The introduction of new seeds promised quite clearly that
                    yields would jump. With the new seeds it became possible to grow rice all year
                    long and not only during the rainy monsoon season. With the new seeds it was
                    possible to grow wheat during the dry season, using irrigation. All of these
                    things took convincing, if you will. The Bangladeshis had inherited from their
                    days as part of East Pakistan both a reliance on PL 480 food and a reliance on
                    West Pakistani wheat. Both of those, in one way or another, were frightfully
                    expensive. They involved the costs of subsidies, administration, and production.
                    They were also politically problematic, because continuing with this system
                    meant that, basically, the cities and towns of Bangladesh did not have to look
                    to their own farmers to the same degree that they would have had to do, if they
                    had had a policy of producing domestically grown food first.</p>
                <p>To be perfectly frank with you, I don't know that I ever went through the
                    Bangladeshi budget with Bangladeshi counterpart personnel. We worked with
                    Bangladeshis on the details of their PL 480 agreements. We met very often with
                    the Australians, the British, and representatives of FAO [Food and Agricultural
                    Organization, a UN specialized agency] to talk about specific details. By
                    specific details, I mean the language of the agreements on which we were in
                    accord.</p>
                <p>I know that, these days, it is important to talk about “ownership.” As early as
                    1973 we started to discuss these self help measures with the Bangladeshis. We
                    tried not to arrange these matters unilaterally in our own offices. We worked
                    with the Bangladeshis. We asked for draft language. This was the kind of thing
                    that we frequently discussed with the Bangladeshis.</p>
                <p>The American Ambassador and the then USAID Mission Director were part and parcel
                    of this discussion. I remember that Joe Toner, the USAID Mission Director,
                    chaired the first meeting ever held with representatives of the World Bank and
                    of the International Monetary Fund about the importance of food and agriculture,
                    and not just budgets and debt. So the World Bank became an ally in this process.
                    It didn't take the World Bank very long to realize that Bangladesh needed to
                    become a “bread basket.” It needed to become “Golden Bengal,” the traditional
                    term for referring to Bengal's fertility in producing food, for a good
                    reason.</p>
                <p>So the policy of displaying “vision” worked, if you will. In other words, I
                    didn't approach this issue as an economist, an accountant, or even as a food aid
                    person. I basically had a “dream” which, quite frankly, I probably “stole” from
                    other people. John Mellor was instrumental in applying this concept of a “Green
                    Revolution.” Herb Rees was magnificent in shipping out to us any expert that he
                    could get his hands on. At the time world experts like John Mellor, Gus Ranus,
                    Gus Papanek, and John Lewis were all curious about Bangladesh. They knew that
                    this was a “new” country which some people were “writing off” as “hopeless.”
                    Some of them considered it a “basket case.” So more or less accidentally the
                    USAID Mission in Bangladesh benefitted from people coming through and talking
                    about the “Green Revolution.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do a lot of the basic, economic analysis and
                        calculations of the subsidies and so on? Did you provide that to the
                        Bangladeshi Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, we did. We analyzed the cost of production of the old and new
                    seeds and the “pay off” of the new seeds. We followed seed stocks and flows. We
                    followed prices on a daily basis. We had charts on all of these matters. Quite
                    honestly, our first motive was worrying about food. We knew quite well that the
                    conversation with the Bangladeshis would “go off the rails” if there was a
                    famine or food crisis.</p>
                <p>I recall doing the kinds of analyses that I have just described. I don't recall
                    personally having done any budget analyses on the subsidies, although we may
                    have done so. I guess that I was a “practical” economist. I was looking at the
                    stocks, flows, and opportunities presented by the “Green Revolution” as the way
                    to tell the story, not only to the Bangladeshis but back to Washington. As you
                    can appreciate, a lot of the battle consisted of convincing USAID, the
                    Department of State, and particularly the U.S. Department of Agriculture that we
                    had to scrutinize these shipments closely, to make sure that they arrived in the
                    right amount, at the right time, and under the right conditions that would
                    support taking a broader “vision” of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there pressures to take on more food aid than you
                        thought was appropriate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Very much so. But we also learned, the hard way, that sometimes the
                    food wasn't available when we genuinely needed it. Also, during the middle of
                    that period, Bangladesh was selling jute sacking to Cuba, which actually led to
                    the suspension of a shipment or two of food aid. That was quite a shock, a very
                    sobering shock to the Bangladeshi Government and, I think, to the World Bank and
                    the International Monetary Fund, too. They realized that Uncle Sam wouldn't
                    always “be there.” In this case there were other, overriding foreign policy
                    considerations, from the U.S. point of view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the Title II, the so-called “Food for
                        Work Program.” How did you find that that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: East Pakistan had a long tradition of “shaping” its countryside to
                    further agriculture. By that I mean digging ditches, including irrigation and
                    drainage ditches, building small bridges, and building embankments to control
                    its mighty rivers. All in all there was a well-established tradition of using
                    food and cash to hire people in the off season so that there would be salaries
                    and food available for the underemployed, poor Bangladeshis.</p>
                <p>Several aid donors, including USAID and particularly CARE [Cooperative
                    Association for Relief Everywhere], became involved in major programs to
                    systematize this kind of rural infrastructure. The problem was a tough one. The
                    administrative costs of bringing food halfway around the world to do this were
                    obviously “sky high.” Corruption and engineering were problems. Furthermore,
                    since the 1970's the Bangladeshi Government has withdrawn some of the
                    delegations of authority to its district and local governments to administer
                    food aid. So the rural political system is not as “robust” as it needs to be to
                    administer food aid well. That's one of the conclusions I come to in the new
                    chapter on Bangladesh in my forthcoming book. The preliminary work really
                    depends on political decentralization of authority and talent, so that the
                    earthworks containing the rivers can be well managed by people who are
                    knowledgeable on the ground. These efforts cannot be run out of Dhaka, the
                    capital. Q: You found this administratively feasible and effective that people
                    would accept food for payment of their work, rather than cash? Was that a wise
                    way to go?</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The evidence is mixed. The infrastructure was, in fact, built. However,
                    the salary impact was not large, vis-a-vis the wages paid for planting the seed,
                    and especially the new seeds, themselves. So rural public works were a small
                    proportion of total, rural income. It was never that large. The nutritional
                    impact has been debated intensely. Depending on which study you want to look at,
                    it's either modest or negligible. All in all, this is a difficult program to
                    justify. It continues to go forward because the need is great, particularly when
                    people are hungry and certainly when they are starving. However, this is a “stop
                    gap” measure at best, and a very expensive one at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into Title II payments in cash for wages and
                        all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, but I don't recall the details of how much food and how much cash
                    was provided. I know that we experimented with both. One of the beauties of the
                    program was that we all considered it, all of the time, as a full time
                    experiment. Very little was “proven” because the minute you had something
                    “proven,” there would be a “curve ball,” and we would have a change. There would
                    be a flood or a lack of cash and so we had to make do with food. Seldom did we
                    have the flexibility to go back and forth easily between food and cash.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>It was very tough. I've always admired CARE for being willing to administer the
                    program for us. It was a huge job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CARE handled most of the Title II program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. Again, I'm relying on my memory of more than 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Title III assistance, which was an added element, required
                        more stringent conditions, action by the Bangladeshi Government, and so on.
                        How did you find that worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Title III assistance came along in part because of visits to Bangladesh
                    by members of the staff of the Agriculture Committee of the U.S. House of
                    Representatives. The Bellman amendment arose out of the spoilage of PL 480 food
                    which was observed by these staff members of the Agriculture Committee. We had
                    to take great care to ensure that the food and seed stock situation did not lead
                    to spoilage of food aid, or to a substantial price disincentive.</p>
                <p>Title III itself was designed to “forgive” debt accrued under Title I. We saw in
                    poor countries that this debt certainly would not be repaid. We also saw that
                    the Title I “self help” measures were basically a “fig leaf” and were not really
                    respected in as many cases as they should have been. I think that USAID can take
                    some credit for having gotten the food assistance program going in Bangladesh,
                    at a time when there was legislative “ferment” in Congress. I don't think that
                    Title III came out of the Bangladesh experience alone, but I think that we had a
                    very large influence on it. I recall seeing the draft legislation and having a
                    chance to edit it myself.</p>
                <p>It was fascinating. These staff members of the Agriculture Committee to whom I
                    have referred were in close communication with us after their visit to
                    Bangladesh. They saw our “view” of the situation. They saw the possibility of
                    using food aid to help Bangladesh grow its own food. They saw that PL 480 could
                    be used, as and when needed, to bolster that larger effort.</p>
                <p>Title III provided “grant” food aid under our very close scrutiny. As I'm sure
                    you're aware, the Title III programs around the world are scrutinized very
                    closely back here in Washington. Some people would say too much so.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Later, after I left Bangladesh, I was involved in several PL 480 Title III
                    programs. I pushed some and cancelled others that were poorly conceived, too
                    idealistic, or what have you. I suppose that you could draw a parallel between
                    Title III and what it enabled us to do in Bangladesh and the DFA [Development
                    Fund for Africa] in Africa. Title III was an example of “courageous thinking” by
                    lots of groups, at least back here in Washington, which were often at
                    loggerheads.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the food aid program during the time that
                        you were in Bangladesh? Can you remember the magnitudes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that the maximum amount of food aid received in Bangladesh in
                    any one year was about 450,000 tons. Over the many years of this program our
                    share was roughly 45 percent of all food aid. The Bangladeshis paid for a
                    little, commercial food, but most of it was a grant from food aid donors.
                    Without a doubt AID provided the largest amount of this kind of aid. The
                    tonnages are available in public documents, but I don't have them at my
                    fingertips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find coordination of this assistance with
                        other aid donors? Were there any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that, with the benefit of hindsight, there were problems in
                    only one quarter. That was with the U.S. Agricultural Attach� in Bangladesh. He
                    was determined to sell U.S. food, and Bangladeshi interests and Bangladeshi
                    agriculture be damned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He saw Bangladesh as a market for U.S. agricultural
                        exports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, that's right. I think that this was the one time during my career
                    in USAID that I “lost my cool” in front of the Ambassador. It's a little
                    surprising to say that our other aid colleagues in providing food aid became our
                    partners. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had no knowledge or
                    necessarily any experience with food aid. At the time the FAO [Food and
                    Agricultural Organization of the UN] didn't have much experience with food aid.
                    The World Food Program [WFP] was “learning the ropes,” just as we were learning.
                    I would say that during the period from 1973 to 1975 the Bank economists and the
                    other aid donors all started with the same “sheet of music.” Warts and all, I
                    think that this program was an example of effective, international
                    cooperation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding the family planning program in Bangladesh, I
                        gather that what you're saying is that it began during your time there. What
                        was involved in getting this program launched and how was it received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't know this as well as I know the food assistance program. Mike
                    Jordan and Dallas Voran were staff people under Tony Schwarzwalder and Joe Toner
                    who worked hard on the family planning program. Joe is the person who, I think,
                    deserves most of the credit for appreciating that Bangladesh could not just go
                    on “growing more people.” They had to deal with both sides of the equation of
                    food and people. They simply had to grow more food and had to make family
                    planning services available.</p>
                <p>Joe Toner did something that is more or less unheard of these days. He went on a
                    personal campaign to the capitals of the donor assistance countries, making the
                    case for family planning “or else.” He said that donors had to be very tough
                    minded. I recall that he went to Bonn and London, as well as one or two other
                    capitals. I think that Joe felt very disappointed when he came back from this
                    trip. I think that he felt that he had been out “at the end of the plank,” as it
                    were. He felt that there weren't many voices helping him along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't much reception for his support for family
                        planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Not at the time. Today, looking back on it, making family planning an
                    issue as he did, in his meetings with President Zia of Bangladesh and with every
                    senior civil servant that he could talk to made quite a difference. The
                    Bangladeshis themselves also made a very special contribution. They developed a
                    cadre of women family planning workers. That one step, over and above the “push”
                    from the aid donor countries, also explains why family planning is taking hold
                    in Bangladesh today. The “contraceptive prevalence” or use rate among married
                    couples in Bangladesh is as high as 45 percent today. It is a remarkable
                    achievement. Birth rates are coming down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the family planning program sponsored by a government
                        ministry or were there private groups involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: There is a private element involved in this program as well. As I'm
                    sure you're aware, most of these family planning programs are, in fact, financed
                    by a blend of public and private resources. Probably most of the money is
                    provided by the public sector, using public officials. There are condom sales
                    through private mechanisms, using advertising. It is a multi-faceted
                    approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any cultural resistance to this program that you
                        recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Bangladesh is a Muslim country. I recall that there was resistance.
                    However, basically the civil service and the political leadership supported the
                    necessity of the family planning program. I can digress from this for a moment
                    and tell you how this was dealt with. In Tanzania Julius Nyerere called all of
                    the church and religious leaders together to talk about family planning. They
                    had a very low key program in Tanzania funded by the NGO's [non governmental
                    organizations] throughout the socialist experiments in the 1960's and 1970's.
                    They had nothing but disdain for Western family planning programs. The Tanzanian
                    Government treated our program with great suspicion at first. President Nyerere
                    called the religious leaders together and talked about the importance of family
                    planning and voluntary acceptance of it. He said that Tanzania couldn't go on
                    doubling and tripling its population. Well, the Protestant and the Catholic
                    representatives in Tanzania stood up and, in effect, said: “Nuts to you!” The
                    Muslim representatives also said: “Nuts! We don't believe in family planning.”
                    At the end of this meeting President Nyerere said: “I'm glad that you all agree
                    with me. We are going ahead with family planning. Thank you very much.” That's
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're getting off the subject a bit, but we'll come
                        back to it. What convinced President Nyerere of the need for family
                        planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I can only guess. The world has changed so fast from the point of view
                    of world leaders. In their lifetime they can see this. President Nyerere must
                    have seen this. He was the founding father of an independent Tanzania, when the
                    population of the country was 10 or 11 million people. Today the population is
                    29 million. The GNP [Gross National Product] is flat and per capita income,
                    nutrition levels, and literacy are declining. You would have to be awfully dumb
                    not to see that things are “out of line.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in Bangladesh what was Joe Toner's line with the
                        Bangladeshi leadership in trying to convince them? Were they hard to
                        convince or was it pretty obvious to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that his determined “push” behind the family planning program,
                    year in and year out, made a difference. His argument was two-fold. One, there
                    was a food-population problem. Secondly, Joe also drew on USAID's worldwide
                    experience. We know about voluntary family planning. We know about family
                    planning services. We know about counseling. There is nothing that is cohesive
                    about it. There is nothing “mechanistic” about it. It's simply a question of
                    making family planning services available for people who may or may not be
                    interested. The truth of the matter is that if the men of the world would just
                    get out of the way, it is now clear in the 1980's and 1990's that family
                    planning is very quickly accepted, once women have a chance to make a judgment
                    on it. This is happening in Tanzania and Zambia, and it's beginning to happen in
                    Egypt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about this women's group in Bangladesh. Was it
                        part of a government agency or were they just on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I'm sorry. You may have misunderstood me. Where I'm working now, IFPRI,
                    Nurul Islam, who was then Chairman of the Planning Commission in Bangladesh and
                    is now here in Washington, working with the International Food Policy Research
                    Institute, said to me, right out of the blue: “You know, Joe, the thing that
                    made the difference is that the Bangladeshi Government decided to hire women and
                    not men as the outreach component of the public, family planning program.” So,
                    right off the bat, you had women carrying the family planning message. You can
                    imagine that it would be a very different story if the outreach component of the
                    family planning program were exclusively made up of men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. Was family planning linked in with general
                        child care and the health program, or was it a separate effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In the early years I believe that it was linked with the MCH [Maternal
                    Child Health] program, but not with general health reform. I don't exactly know.
                    I think that it was child-focused on family planning and general health.
                    However, it was not specifically linked with the health sector as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was USAID in Bangladesh involved in the health
                        sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I believe that we are now. I don't recall that we were so involved in
                    the Bangladeshi health sector at that time. We contributed to the health sector
                    through the Cholera Lab. We supported the first oral rehydration experiments,
                    and the eradication of smallpox. There are major success stories in these areas.
                    I've talked to my friends who are involved in health matters and have urged them
                    to start writing about it. The health stories are as exciting as some of the
                    agricultural stories. I don't believe that they've been written up. They deserve
                    wide, American understanding. Around the world the USAID health contribution has
                    been dramatic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. There is a general presumption that Bangladesh is
                        in perpetual crisis from floods, storms, and so on. Masses of people are
                        wiped out. Was there any effort to try to minimize the damage of these
                        periodic disasters? People talk about all sorts of public programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I recall working on early warning systems and training for early
                    warning. Our earthwork projects involved the construction of some major
                    embankments, but I don't recall any large scale, USAID funded program. I think
                    that there is an appreciation that Bangladesh is, in fact, frequently “on the
                    edge” of disaster and that its ability to deal with extra high floods and storm
                    surges out of the Bay of Bengal is quite beyond any engineering capacity.</p>
                <p>When Bangladesh was still East Pakistan, we had tried to build shelters. I think
                    that just after the independence of Bangladesh we built a few more shelters, so
                    that people who lived down on the lowlands, called chars, would have a place run
                    to in case of a high storm surge. In retrospect, I think that they were very
                    modest contributions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard that there were major efforts by the World Bank
                        and others to develop some sort of structures that would help to minimize
                        the flooding and so forth. I don't know whether this was a wise decision or
                        not. Some people debate that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. I was involved in a major policy debate within the USAID Mission
                    on exactly this point. The World Bank, working with East Pakistani engineers,
                    had designed a program of building “polders” in all of the flood-prone area of
                    Bangladesh. That basically involved building protected islands, wherein there
                    would be embankments to provide protection against major storms. There would be
                    drainage and irrigation facilities provided. In other words, donors would have
                    to design a system for flood-prone Bangladesh to protect it against floods, to
                    provide ensured drainage, and irrigation in the dry season. When all was said
                    and done, it became extraordinarily expensive to attempt to control Mother
                    Nature. My philosophy was to live with Mother Nature and not to fight her. I
                    remember distinctly that this was a hotly debated issue within the Mission. We
                    had major discussions, and a lot of ill will was generated.</p>
                <p>You've probably heard the names of some of the people involved in these
                    discussions. I don't need to mention the names to you. Our Director was a
                    diplomat and a gentleman who didn't take sides. However, he vetoed this project
                    for what he probably considered were his own good reasons. He saw something that
                    I had not appreciated. That is, this kind of project of providing major
                    protection for flood-prone areas of Bangladesh would have required a very large,
                    American staff out in the field, implementing this project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have involved the construction of dikes and
                        such things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the alternative? I gather that you have a
                        different idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: The alternative is to recognize that Bangladesh is normally subject to
                    flooding, every year. About 60 percent of the country goes under water normally,
                    every year. In the light of that fact Bangladesh rice is either planted and
                    harvested before the floods or some of it, the so-called “deep water rice,”
                    grows with the floods. The “deep water rice” of Bangladesh contributes a
                    significant amount to the total food basket. In other words, Bangladeshi
                    cultivators, over the millennia, have gradually selected “deep water rice” seed
                    varieties, which are now new and improved, for these “deep water”
                    situations.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I would add that the Bangladeshi private sector has picked up
                    where the government has allowed the decontrol of irrigation equipment. The
                    private sector is now providing pumps for dry land agriculture during the
                    winter. So areas that had been dry and fallow before are now producing rice,
                    wheat, vegetables, and all kinds of other crops. That's another way of
                    accommodating Mother Nature in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we heavily involved in agricultural education and
                        extension programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't believe so. I don't believe that we got involved in
                    agricultural extension programs as such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we get involve in distributing the new varieties
                        of seeds and introducing them to the farmers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that the World Bank, British aid, and one or two, other donors
                    had a major involvement in the extension program. Quite honestly, I'm not much
                    of a fan of public extension programs to extend improved seeds. Farmers
                    basically copy what they know to be good practices. You don't need to convince
                    them if you've got something to “sell.” They will buy it. Bangladesh is a fairly
                    small country, and the seed research people go everywhere, involving farmers
                    directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in agricultural research efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way were you involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: There were American scientists from The International Rice Research
                    Institute (IRRI), who conducted research, training, and seminars.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not from U.S. universities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In the 1960's we were involved in institution building for agricultural
                    research. As part and parcel of American “land grant” support for Indian
                    universities we supported the University of Mymensingh. I'm sorry to say that I
                    think that that effort was a “bust.” I don't know that much came of it.</p>
                <p>The seed research center was a separate institution which had separate USAID and
                    Ford Foundation funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know the name of the center or what it was
                        called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, or the BRRI. It was a
                    sister organization to the IRRI [International Rice Research Institute at Los
                    Banos in the Philippines]. Like everything else, I've sort of lost touch with
                    the BRRI. I heard a comment recently that some of the senior BRRI research
                    scientists have been “enticed away” to the international system. If this is
                    true, it is potentially worrisome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have anything in the way of educational or training
                        programs of any kind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't recall. I think that we sent a few participant trainees to the
                    U.S. in the 1970's, but I don't believe that we had a major training program, as
                    such. We did not have curriculum reform programs for the school system or for
                    the universities.</p>
                <p>I think that what we did, Haven, was to spend an awful lot of dollars on food and
                    also on fertilizers. You know, these are “big ticket” items. They really used up
                    the money. As I recall it, family planning “commodities” also “chewed up” a lot
                    of dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what the total program amounted to? What
                        magnitudes are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't remember. If you'd like me to track it down, I'll be glad to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The idea is to give people who read this interview some
                        sense of the scale.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: The overall USAID portfolio in Bangladesh in the late 1970's approached
                    $1.0 billion annually in total over these early years. It was very large. Food
                    aid was a little more than half of that. AID in project form provided about $200
                    million a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very substantial program.STEPANEK: Yes, it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were the biggest aid donor, apart from the World
                        Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We were the biggest, bilateral aid donor. Right, including both dollars
                    and food aid, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the fertilizer side, were you also involved in the
                        privatization effort? How did you go about that process and make it
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Dean Alter was the staff person who led the way in this direction. We
                    did it in much the same way that we handled the introduction of wheat to
                    stabilize urban prices. We agreed with the Bangladeshi Government to try this
                    out, on a pilot basis. So we agreed to the “private sale” of fertilizer in a
                    few, selected districts, just to see if it would work. We didn't pretend that we
                    knew it would work. We just said: “Let's give it a whirl.”</p>
                <p>The Bangladeshi Government sensed that the fertilizer administration and the
                    fertilizer subsidy were bankrupting the civil service and the budget.</p>
                <p>We worked hard with people from “Muscle Shoals,” Alabama , who were brought out
                    to Bangladesh by USAID. They were instrumental in convincing the Bangladeshis on
                    the basis of their worldwide experience that it would work. It has faced
                    problems, just as the public distribution of fertilizer in Kenya has faced
                    problems. You know, the vested interests and sometimes the military get
                    involved. I think that there were some “reversals” in the 1980's. I believe that
                    that has now been sorted out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were private companies formed, and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: There were dozens and dozens of them established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, private sales companies, not companies processing
                        fertilizer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: There is a parastatal fertilizer producing company in Bangladesh which
                    we helped to finance and build, using locally produced, natural gas. It was done
                    in part with our money, but the World Bank was in the lead on this project.</p>
                <p>Regarding fertilizer privatization, we tried this at the retail level first. From
                    that point we worked toward the wholesale level and to importation. It was a
                    gradual process. In retrospect, Haven, I think that that kind of incrementalism
                    is terribly important. That is, the willingness to say: “We don't know for sure
                    if this is the right path, but let's try and experiment.” That is, the
                    willingness to start small, to reverse course if you make a mistake, and the
                    willingness to go on pushing if it looks as if it is working.</p>
                <p>I think that we learned an awful lot about the concept of structural adjustment
                    in the government administration of Bangladesh two decades before it became
                    popular, say, in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you persisted in trying out an idea and kept it going
                        long enough to be really sure that it was a good one. But then you imply
                        that the climate was right, that there was a government which sufficiently
                        recognized the importance of allowing this to go ahead or even to
                        experiment. This is a situation which you do not often have in some
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. One of the things that I concluded, as I said, in Chapter IV of my
                    forthcoming book is that the Bangladeshis had to make this “vision” their own.
                    Otherwise, this program would not have gone forward. There is a certain role for
                    a “push” from the aid donors, and there is a certain role for a unilateral kind
                    of donor “push.” However, after a certain point the national government has to
                    feel either that the program is theirs or is not theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular techniques that you used to
                        persuade the Bangladeshis to feel this kind of “ownership” of an idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We used every trick in the book. We cajoled and lectured them, traveled
                    together, drank together, visited the field together, looked at evidence from
                    other countries, sent them on trips to other countries, and used every possible
                    device, including setting conditions on our aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In this particular case I think that it was part of the jigsaw puzzle.
                    It's one of those “tricky” situations. They know and you know that you're not
                    going to cut off aid and go home. So you know that you have to negotiate
                    carefully and convincingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way in connection with the food aid program there
                        used to be very substantial conditions and precise requirements, as I
                        recall. You had all of that to contend with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, the conditions were difficult. I recall vividly that occasionally
                    a cable would come back from USAID in Washington or from the Department of
                    Agriculture that said: “Well, that's not good enough. Stiffen it.” This was all
                    very well and good, but in some cases we had spent months negotiating particular
                    language covering an agreement with the Bangladeshis. We then found it
                    extraordinarily difficult to go back at the eleventh hour to the Bangladeshis
                    and say: “Sorry, but Washington tells us that this language is not good enough.”
                    So there was both a risk of being too “gentle” and a risk of being too
                    “tough.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that you'd like to mention about
                        your Bangladeshi experience you want to refer to at this point? You can
                        always add it later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: This assignment to Bangladesh taught me a great deal. For myself and my
                    family it was a wonderful first posting. It was extraordinarily demanding, but
                    we didn't seem to realize that. We just did our job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Embassy, apart from the
                        Agricultural Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We did. The Economic Officer, Don Born, in the Embassy was a “friend in
                    court.” I spent a lot of time working with him. As I recall, the Ambassador and
                    the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] were helpful. I saw some of the political
                    reporting. My views were often asked by Embassy officers. There were the usual
                    tensions and strains with the Embassy but, by and large, we functioned as a
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from the jute bags being shipped to Cuba, were there
                        other instances where U.S. political and security interests were overriding
                        or undercutting what you were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The jute story is the one little “crisis” that we had. The other,
                    general or generic problem was that the USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture]
                    was rather late in “getting on board” with respect to the purpose of Title III
                    of PL 480. They were very happy with Title I transactions. They could sell
                    commodities under Title I wherever they could sell them. Title III transactions
                    were another matter and that situation was aggravating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on the State Department side, the political side, what
                        were our interests in that part of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't recall. As we all know, Bangladesh was not on the “front
                    burner” of American foreign policy interests. The period of which I am speaking
                    was the height of the Cold War. We were still in Vietnam, and our interests were
                    elsewhere. I think that the senior level in the State Department felt that
                    Bangladesh was part of India. India was to be “brought along” gradually, but our
                    “ally,” so to speak, was Pakistan. So for several reasons Bangladesh was not
                    high on the foreign policy agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding relations between India and Bangladesh, were we
                        involved in any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I wasn't involved directly, but there were simmering tensions,
                    particularly over water. There was the issue of the Farraka Barrage, a well
                    known “flash point” between India and Bangladesh which has been resolved only
                    recently. There was food smuggling across the border, of course, as well as
                    migration issues. Several factors led to tensions between the two countries.
                    There were no large crises that I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unless there's something else that you want to add to your
                        recollections of your Bangladesh assignment at this point...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I guess that I'm a little embarrassed that my recollections are so
                    vague. I should have more of these numbers at my fingertips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not unusual. Well, you finished up in Bangladesh in
                        what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return to Washington to the USAID Policy Bureau - 1977</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was in the summer of 1977. I came back to USAID Washington to work
                    for the PPC [Policy and Program Coordination Bureau].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in PPC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The position title placed it within the Rural Development Division,
                    under Doug Caton. The Rural Development Division itself was first under Ed Hogan
                    and then John Eriksson, I believe. In fact, I worked as a Title III “wallah”
                    [expert], more or less directly for Alex Shakow. Interestingly enough, I had a
                    wonderful experience during this assignment. Tony Schwarzwalder suggested to Dr
                    Peter Bourne, who was on the White House staff, that I would be a good candidate
                    to work on the White House World Hunger Working Group.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So, during a long and very wet winter [1977-1978] I traipsed over to the Old
                    Executive Office Building to work as part of that team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Trying to solve world hunger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That, of course, brought me face to face with Kay Bitterman, who at the
                    time was head of the Food for Peace office, and with all the powers that be from
                    USAID, USDA, and the White House. It was a very, very interesting
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the result of that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Not a thing, but we had a good time discussing the matter and, I think,
                    we said the right things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: What we tried to do was to mobilize the federal bureaucracy to do a
                    better job of things that we were all supposed to be doing. In other words,
                    helping the poorer world get on its feet. We all know why that kind of thing
                    doesn't work all of that easily. It did not result in a report that recommended
                    more food aid, more largesse, more CARE [Cooperative Association for Relief
                    Everywhere] packages, or what have you. I think that this team was a good
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this all covered in the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was recommended in the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: It recommended that we not set up a World Hunger Commission, which, of
                    course, President Carter did. So there was a Commission, with Commission
                    members. They also issued a report, which also yielded nothing. I don't think
                    that anything came out of any of this. As we all know, President Carter was
                    quite an idealist who felt that, with enough good will, he could solve any
                    problem. So we turned to doing that.</p>
                <p>As a young man from USAID, fresh from the field in Bangladesh, of course, I felt
                    that I had all the answers and so I had a great time learning that I didn't have
                    a “clue.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The politics were considerable in that connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The politics were considerable and, despite the disappointments on that
                    side, I think that Alex Shakow and I, as well as others, were instrumental in
                    putting Title III of the PL 480 law firmly in place and firmly on the side of
                    development. That was a lasting contribution. At the end of that period Title
                    III and all that it represented were firmly rooted in the government
                    bureaucracies. So I think that in that sense my personal role and other people's
                    work yielded the kinds of results that they were supposed to yield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with the Interagency Food Aid Committee,
                        which made all of the decisions on food allocations and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I was involved with that some of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an unusual phenomenon, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. I don't think that I was a regular member of the
                    Committee but I went to many of its meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It did work. Sometimes we, as a Committee, were too demanding about the
                    self help provisions. However, I think that, all in all, the Committee people
                    listened to reason. One of the things that Alex Shakow was able to do was to
                    keep the State Department representatives from being too “political” with
                    respect to PL 480 agreements.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I had a fascinating experience. Vice President Mondale, who served under
                    President Carter, had promised a Title III program to the Indonesians. I was
                    asked to go out to Indonesia with Harry Petrequin to negotiate a Title III
                    agreement. We realized that the Title III program would be small, cumbersome,
                    and, quite frankly, “demeaning.” I went back to Washington and said this to Alex
                    Shakow, who agreed with me. We decided not to go ahead with the Title III
                    program and, in essence, break the promise that had been made to the
                    Indonesians.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget a meeting between Alex Shakow and some officials from the State
                    Department. They looked down their noses at Alex and said: “Well, we're going to
                    have to take this matter to the White House.” Alex said: “Go to it.” That was
                    the last that we ever heard of it!</p>
                <p>Alex was instrumental in “cleaning the lines up” between Title I, Title II, and
                    Title III of the PL 480 legislation which had different, express purposes. Not
                    that the law was perfect, but clarifying its provisions was a step in the right
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine that the Treasury and OMB [Office of Management
                        and Budget] had an influence on certain uses of the PL 480 law. I suppose
                        that they were all heavily involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I believe so. Yes, they were. OMB was usually the quickest to take the
                    developmental point of view, which, more often than not, was very helpful to us
                    in USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Treasury's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Kind of passive, as I recall, in those cases. This was before the
                    period of “structural adjustment,” and I was not directly involved in getting
                    Treasury approval of World Bank and International Monetary Fund agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Treasury a member of the food aid committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't recall. They may have been involved, but I don't remember. One
                    of the things that I did, maybe wrongly, when I retired and came to Washington
                    and started working on my book, was to throw out all of my files after just a
                    cursory look, and almost everything that related to my professional life in
                    USAID.</p>
                <p>OMB was quite an ally. Ruth Greenstein was an activist as well. She was the one
                    who came to the regular meetings of the food committee and was very supportive.
                    In retrospect, I guess that that was a special era.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were fishing very hard on “conditionality” and the

                <p>STEPANEK: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. This put Alex Shakow and me in the position of being the
                    “compromisers.” This made it easier for us to do what we really wanted to do.
                    That is, to have people “balancing” each other. Otherwise, it was too much of a
                    “one way” street in dumping food aid. The State Department approach is that they
                    didn't care what it looked like as long as the numbers added up large enough to
                    keep our friends happy in various foreign countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any special commodity pressure from USDA [U.S.
                        Department of Agriculture], saying that “We want to 'push' wheat over rice
                        or rice over wheat”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, that was part of the equation. Occasionally, there would be
                    pressure about other kinds of commodities, like oil. We got a “bum deal” in
                    Bangladesh when we imported low quality cotton that was filled with dirt. Of
                    course, USDA said: “That is not our responsibility. It's the responsibility of
                    the Bangladeshis.”</p>
                <p>There was probably an “ugly story” there some place. Possibly the Bangladeshis
                    had accepted low quality cotton in exchange for a “kickback.” I recall a story
                    that somebody was “paid off” with a paper bag full of money, and the
                    Bangladeshis used the money to buy their Embassy here in Washington. There was
                    something like that, but I don't know who is to blame.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your other functions in that role, in PPC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I tried to write a food aid policy paper, with the full blessing of
                    Doug Caton and Alex Shakow. I got clearance from everybody, except for Charley
                    Palillo. Charley didn't believe that a policy of any kind could help poor
                    people. So he “sat” on this paper for two years. After I left USAID, Don
                    McClellan was instrumental in getting that paper out as an official USAID policy
                    statement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust of that paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was the Bangladesh story, just written up generically. The idea was
                    that it was possible and even desirable to use food aid to help countries grow
                    their own food.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the Bangladesh experience was
                        transferrable to other countries, by and large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, that the agricultural situation should be market based. There
                    should be a set of prices for cultivators. Inputs should be supplied through
                    market channels. You have to respect the necessity of a food security system
                    because governments are responsible for handling that, in some ways, even though
                    households and markets can help you greatly in times of crisis. It is possible
                    to use American resources to foster those objectives.</p>
                <p>I used the whole paradigm of “food for development” as a way of describing it in
                    shorthand terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there were a lot of critics saying that, in
                        fact, food aid was a “disincentive” in a lot of situations. It tended to
                        “flood the market” and undercut...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's very true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how does one prevent that situation from
                        developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The mechanical way to watch it was just the timing and amounts of the
                    shipments of food aid. So, generally speaking, food would arrive when market
                    prices started to move upwards, well after the end of the harvest. Thus,
                    governments could use food arrivals to sell and keep the prices of food from
                    reaching a temporary “spike” and therefore causing more people to be
                    impoverished.</p>
                <p>The intellectual argument is a simple one. Applying it in practice is often
                    “tough,” if only because a ship tends to arrive when prices are “soft” and
                    stocks of food are high, rather than the other way around. At least in concept
                    this idea is something that's worth pushing for. Q: But it requires a careful,
                    management process.</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It does. It takes courage to try to turn ships “on and off” as the
                    situation warrants. I'm sure that you're aware that many countries can grow food
                    in less time than it takes to access, order, and deliver American food. This is
                    another reason why these kinds of things tend to be “cyclical” rather than
                    “contra-cyclical.” This is a great source of frustration.</p>

                <p>STEPANEK: I had several TDYs [Temporary Duty] on Title III issues. I went to
                    Khartoum [Sudan], Mogadishu [Somalia], and Jakarta [Indonesia], which I have
                    already mentioned. These were all very interesting experiences. I worked on

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: No. If there were, Haven, I just don't recall them. Doug Caton was very
                    generous in letting me work more or less full time for Alex Shakow and for the
                    World Hunger Working Group. I was there for two years. The TDY period on Title
                    III issues led to a job offer from Walter Bollinger and Tom Niblock to work in
                    the USAID Mission in Indonesia, much to my complete amazement. I had “trashed”
                    the promise from Vice President Mondale to the Indonesians. Then I was invited
                    back to serve in Indonesia. You know Tom Niblock better than I do. You can
                    imagine that that was somewhat of a surprise.</p>

                    this discussion. That's all that he could talk about. Others talked a lot about

                <p>STEPANEK: Yes.</p>

                <p>Assignment in Indonesia as mission economist - 1979</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In 1979. I told Walter Bollinger that because of my experience in USAID
                    in Bangladesh I had decided that I was not going to work for USAID Program
                    Officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, because I found them to be arbitrary and “territorial.” I just
                    felt that life was too short to waste time fighting with these fellows. I
                    explained to Walter Bollinger that I'd be happy to come to Jakarta, provided I
                    could answer to him as a Mission Economist and not be under the Program Office.
                    Again, much to my surprise, Walter said: “Yes.” So it worked out fairly well. I
                    got “cross wise” with Tom Niblock on a couple of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bollinger was the Deputy Mission Director, and Tom Niblock
                        was the Mission Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, that's right. That was a whole different kettle of fish because
                    Indonesia is very much its own empire, in charge of its own house. It is very
                    powerful and an amazing country to serve in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation that you saw when you arrived
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Indonesia was becoming very important. The scale of the wealth that was
                    beginning to flow into the country was impressive. Indonesia was struggling with
                    the beginnings of its social programs, provincial planning, rural credit, family
                    planning, irrigation, and various kinds of “devolution” issues. In the case of
                    Indonesia “devolution” is not quite the right word because it is very tightly
                    controlled by the central government's civil service, as well as the military.
                    Nonetheless, the process involved “devolution” from their point of view.</p>
                <p>I got involved in programs to evaluate irrigation and rural development programs,
                    and health. The health people in the USAID Mission liked my support. We
                    developed a “Development Studies Program” which, I think, was a very fine idea
                    whose time had come. Mainly, the idea was to give resources to Indonesian
                    technocrats so that they could figure out their own programs and hire foreign
                    and Indonesian experts to help them study the problems. It was a nice breath of
                    fresh air.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The highlight for me about Indonesia came out surprisingly. I think that, as a
                    Mission Economist, I was slowly realizing that I was “right” but “irrelevant.” I
                    got kind of fed up. As a consequence of that feeling of being in “limbo,” a
                    couple of things happened. Number one, I wrote to Ray Love, who was then, I
                    think, your immediate successor (Deputy Assistant Administrator, Africa
                    Bureau).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Successor, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Also, Bill Fuller showed up as Mission Director in Indonesia. For
                    reasons that aren't at all clear to me, they decided to use me as an “in house”
                    management consultant. I was assigned to decide how to understand and “get on
                    top of” this unwieldy USAID Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it unwieldy? What was this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Because there were about 55 “direct hire” American personnel. Each
                    division was a bit of an empire of its own. Bill Fuller sensed that right away.
                    He went through an exhaustive review of the entire portfolio of USAID projects.
                    I think that he felt, early on, that some of them were “rubbish,” and he had a
                    very hard time controlling it.</p>
                <p>So, first because of Bill Fuller, I realized that I really liked to handle
                    management issues. I had never thought about this kind of a job before. I had
                    grown up in USAID, hating Program Officers, and I swore that I had no use for
                    any of them. Because of Bill Fuller and his driving energy and the kinds of
                    questions that he threw at me, I was instrumental in getting the Development
                    Studies Program going and this internal review process, where I acted as a sort
                    of side kick to Bill, dealing with a range of management questions which I had
                    sensed but had never really thought about rigorously. Then, in answer to my
                    letter to Ray Love, he called me on the telephone one fine night and said: “Joe,
                    here's a scope of work.” I said: “That's a very exciting scope of work. What's
                    the position?” He said: “Well, it's as Program Officer.” I said something like:
                    “Over my dead body!” And then we agreed. Ray said: “You know, you take the job
                    and write your own scope memorandum.” I said: “I'll do that, provided that I
                    don't have to be a Program Officer.” Ray said: “Fine, I don't care what you call
                    it.”</p>
                <p>So I became a Program Officer in Nairobi [Kenya]. This meant, primarily,
                    responsibility for the ESF [Economic Support Funds] program.</p>

                <p>STEPANEK: That's fine.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the dimensions of the program area in
                        Indonesia that you felt were effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, at the risk of arguing with Tom Niblock, I think that much of it
                    was effective. Tom pushed rural electrification and irrigation very hard. I
                    think that we were doing some small roads projects. In retrospect, a lot of that
                    was probably useful to have in place as Indonesia sensed its own increasing
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>This was a time when there was a major debate going on among the Indonesian
                    intellectuals about whether there was any “trickle down” taking place and
                    whether poor Indonesians were benefitting from all of this “macro” stuff. I
                    recall being sympathetic to critics, but also appreciating the fact that
                    something was going on that we didn't understand. Today, we now realize that the
                    Indonesians have “knocked the hell” out of their poverty rate. Family planning
                    is working very well. The Green Revolution is working very well. Poverty is
                    being reduced very sharply. It was a remarkable performance on the economic side
                    of the house, apart from what one may feel about Indonesian “democracy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you account for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, I think that it's real, in the sense that the Indonesian
                    Government planned a very deliberate “trickle down” process that turned into a
                    flood. They paid attention to the Green Revolution. They paid attention to the
                    family planning program. For the past 26 years President Suharto has directed
                    his cabinet, every week, to pay attention to family planning. It's as simple as
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a major accomplishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: You're exactly right. Behind the scenes, we worked hard on family
                    planning, we contributed to health, we contributed, indirectly to seed research
                    and to irrigation and to the devolution of provincial authority to locally
                    directed public works projects. I don't think that very much has come of that
                    last subject. The rest of it was timely, in the sense that the ideas were shared
                    with the Indonesian bureaucracy. Pilot projects were tried out just as all of
                    the money started to become available to the Indonesians from their own
                    resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>We put all of this together, and Indonesians, for their own good reasons, fully
                    realized that the benefits of development had to be shared. And it was shared.
                    There are no two ways about it. That is not to say that they could not have done
                    it in a different way, that they could not have tried a little democracy, and so
                    forth. Nevertheless, you look at the Indonesian performance, compared to other
                    countries, and Indonesia, without a doubt, has an impressive record. You always
                    have to say: “So far.”</p>

                        that time in the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, we were training Indonesians in the U.S. under three of the
                    project portfolios at this time. I don't recall a major scholarship program, but
                    there must have been one. I don't recall our focusing our energies on a training
                    program, although I know that many, many Indonesians had been trained in the
                    U.S. I knew this personally because my father had been UN technical trainer for
                    many of these people who have since become senior civil servants in Indonesia.
                    So when I returned to Jakarta, I knew these people personally. These were
                    “family names” in our household. People like Widjojo, Mohammed Saidli, Suryo
                    Sediono, and many others were part of my upbringing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with these people after you went to Jakarta
                        with USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you establish rapport with them and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, I did. I would be the first to say that I was not playing a major
                    role in contacts with them. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
                    were heavily involved in Jakarta. We in the USAID Mission were by no means a
                    major donor of aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time was there an economic advisory team from
                        Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, they were in the woodwork, both for planning and for food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that they were fairly instrumental in
                        connection with some of the economic policies adopted by Indonesia. Were you
                        associated with them at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. We chatted with them now and then, but I won't claim to have been
                    an “equal” or to have been involved in the deliberations they had with the
                    Indonesians. In that sense I would be the first to say that that part of my job
                    was a disappointment. Either I wasn't up to it or I didn't get my Ph.D. from
                    Harvard, so forget it. For whatever reason I didn't get very far with them.</p>
                <p>I tried to follow the macroeconomic scene. I talked to officials from the World
                    Bank and particularly from the International Monetary Fund. The man from the
                    Fund was a personal friend of mine. In fact, there were two or three of them
                    whom I knew fairly well. So I followed these macroeconomic issues pretty closely
                    and reported on them. However, I won't say that I was an “activist” in this
                    area. I suppose that this led to some of my frustration. Here I was, second
                    generation in Jakarta and knew all of these people. However, I was not involved
                    with them, for various reasons. I was changing gears, quite frankly, from being
                    an economist to being a manager, without really appreciating that my interests
                    were changing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Indonesians to work with at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, I learned from my Title III experience that they worked well. At
                    the time that I was in Jakarta on TDY [Temporary Duty], working on a possible
                    Title III agreement with Indonesia, they appreciated my candor. You see, without
                    my having permission to do so, what I did was to lay out all of the requirements
                    that would be leveled on the Indonesians regarding a Title III agreement, as I
                    had worked them out in connection with Harry Petrequin. I didn't say, “You guys
                    would be 'dumb' to take this.” I simply said that these are Washington
                    requirements. They could see for themselves, thanks to my friendly candor, that
                    this was just a good deal more than some “lousy promise.” This was a potential
                    millstone around their neck.</p>
                <p>When I was later assigned to the USAID Mission in Jakarta, some of them
                    remembered that and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their reaction to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Eventually, they decided that they didn't want to have anything to do
                    with this proposed Title III agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they rejected this proposed Title III agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: They didn't have to. We ended the discussions and saved them the
                    trouble of rejecting it. They would probably have taken the agreement to “save
                    face,” but it would not have served their interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they really need this Title III agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: No, of course not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the argument have an influence on whether to have an
                        aid program there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, it was part of the debate, which also concerned the size of the
                    USAID Mission and its traditional character. We weren't being sufficiently
                    “innovative.” U.S.-Indonesian relations were very important for all kinds of
                    other reasons, not the least of which were scientific R&amp;D [Research and
                    Development] and military relationships. The issue of East Timor came up. The
                    Kennedy era flights came up. All kinds of issues came up. I left Indonesia,
                    feeling that our interests in Indonesia were very large and that our aid program
                    was a “side show.” I did not recommend a large aid program because the
                    relationship was so important. I just felt that the relationship was
                    sufficiently diverse and sophisticated that we should certainly recognize that
                    and use other tools. Indonesia is an important country. It sees itself as a kind
                    of “empire.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By implication our aid program in Indonesia became
                        decreasingly relevant in that kind of environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that it became less relevant, particularly in the light of
                    their own resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a different formulation for a program or was the
                        idea just not to have an aid program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Maybe I'm exaggerating this. A lot of things that I did in PPC [Program
                    Office] in Washington, Haven, is that I got involved in a lot of the discussions
                    and am mixing my viewpoints in different jobs now. There was this ongoing,
                    informal discussion about other ways of maintaining a U.S. presence in foreign
                    countries. I remember being involved in that discussion throughout most of my
                    career in USAID.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Jakarta was a very good example for this. Why build roads and ditches and promote
                    family planning for the Indonesians, when they are fully capable of funding
                    things whose value has been proven? Why not just focus on technical assistance
                    and on joint experimentation, for instance? I still believe that and I still
                    think that it represents a very fine, middle income strategy. Whether services
                    are provided on a grant basis or “fee or services” should be determined on a
                    case by case basis. However, I think that there is still a very large role for
                    USAID in middle income, developing countries.</p>
                <p>Transferred to USAID/Kenya - 1983</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that in a larger context. Well, we move
                        on from there to Nairobi, [Kenya], where you were Program Officer despite
                        your reservations. Where were you Program Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In the bilateral mission in Kenya, I worked under Allison Herrick, then
                    Charles Gladson, and then Steve Sinding. All three of them continued my
                    education. I learned a lot from all three. I also learned that ESF can be a very
                    troubling program to run. I worked first with Dick Greene, and then with Kurt
                    Toh. I had a fine office of people working under me. I had very good
                    secretaries. The program analyst assigned to my office was marvelous. I had a
                    marvelous program economist and a very good Deputy Program Officer, so I walked
                    into a situation that was “robust” and remained that way during my four years in
                    Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During those four years what kind of program strategy were
                        you trying to encourage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It involved negotiations of policies agreed to under the base rights
                    agreements, for which ESF was the funding mechanism. I spent most of my time
                    worrying about “leverage” and the “conditionality” of base rights - ESF -
                    agreements, which were renegotiated annually. We also worked on a Title I
                    agreement under the PL 480 legislation. I was involved to some extent on other
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of “conditionality” did you seek to
                        promote?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Under ESF there was an agreement to “liberalize” the economy, which
                    involved liberalizing the foreign exchange system and grain marketing. As best
                    as I can remember, we accomplished nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Because the Kenyans had already contributed their share of the ESF
                    agreement, namely, access rights. They didn't feel like contributing a second
                    time. I can't say that I blame them for that. They knew it, and we knew it, but
                    we were much too idealistic to admit it.</p>
                <p>There was a very famous “showdown” when Peter McPherson [USAID Administrator]
                    visited Nairobi to review progress made under the ESF. We had briefed Peter
                    McPherson well. Little did I realize that that was a mistake! Halfway through
                    the meeting with senior Kenyan officials, Peter “blew his stack,” slammed his
                    hand on the table, stood up, and said, “I've got to catch a plane.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he was not getting anywhere with the Kenyans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. They were “backsliding,” they were “hemming and hawing,”
                    and they had no intention of letting go of state controls on the Kenyan economy.
                    Even today the Kenyan economy is still pretty tightly controlled. Kenya knows
                    that it's an attractive investment haven in Africa. It's a very attractive
                    tourist center. Aid donors love being there. The Embassy has at least 300 people
                    assigned. So it's one of those problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And despite that we continue to provide assistance? This
                        didn't affect our support for Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, that particular program came to an end. Following the hostage
                    crisis with Iran and the seizure of our Embassy in Tehran, the U.S. military
                    decided - years later - that they really didn't need Kenya any more. The State
                    Department, not surprisingly, became the proponent of the ESF program. However,
                    I think that even the Embassy people would have to admit that it didn't amount
                    to much.</p>
                <p>Over the past five or six years the AID program has been caught up in the debate
                    about democracy, pluralism, and so forth. So the program is smaller, staffs are
                    down, the ESF program has since been ended. I believe that it has come to an
                    end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was ESF mostly used for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was used for fertilizer and the procurement of replacement parts for
                    American made machinery. We set up an elaborate, administrative program to run
                    the CIP [Commodity Import Program], in spite of other problems. Again, we were
                    building “barnacles upon barnacles” for what should have been an open trade
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this? Was it because of the Kenyan situation in
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: It also was tied to USAID. We had to police the program to insure that
                    there were competitive bids, quality controls, and sole source procurement. It
                    was a good example of how not to conduct an aid program. There was a rural
                    enterprise program which was fine in concept, but it proved to be a nightmare,
                    bureaucratically. I'm not sure that it ever did get going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it a nightmare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: There were committees on committees, complicated rules and regulations,
                    oversight arrangements and approvals, return flows of moneys, and all of those
                    aspects. It was so complicated that very few people in the USAID Mission ever
                    understood what it was about.</p>
                <p>On the “good news” side we set up an umbrella organization for NGO's [Non
                    Governmental Organizations]. I think that it was one of the first in the world.
                    We were able to provide a lot of money outside the grip of government. We tried
                    to get a scholarship program going, but I don't think that it was ever
                    launched.</p>
                <p>This was a period, though, following on Bangladesh and Indonesia, when Gary
                    Merritt and others, with Steve Sinding's support of course, got a very major
                    family planning program going. I think that that's still working well, though I
                    may be wrong. We also supported Edgerton College agricultural graduates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a time when it was “embarrassing” to move into an
                        institution at the university level? Was there ever an issue about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. We were mostly arguing about winding down our program and getting
                    out of Kenya. Then we decided that we didn't have the courage to do that. We
                    weren't about to take our “flag” out of Edgerton College and allow the Japanese
                    to raise theirs. So it remained AID-funded. David Lumberg was intimately
                    involved in it. I was a critic of this program but was on his side on other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Edgerton College as an institution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It's impressive to see. I believe that there are many graduates of it
                    who hold very good jobs. So I guess that, under conditions of state control,
                    Edgerton graduates are fairly well used in the public and private sector.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, I did. A little bit on business but, quite honestly, mostly for
                    pleasure. My family and I went camping very frequently. We enjoyed that
                    immensely. We didn't see all of Kenya but we saw a good part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the rural communities that you were able
                        to observe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I did not get to know rural Kenya, face to face, the way I felt I knew
                    Bangladesh. I think that, as Program Officer, I felt sort of removed from the
                    country a bit. Honestly, I don't remember very many business trips. I like
                    developmental tourism. I think that I'm about the only USAID employee who's ever
                    taken his family on R&amp;R [Rest and Relaxation] to Djibouti. I used my R&amp;R
                    time to go and see USAID Missions in other countries because I was very
                    interested in the forms of aid programs around the world.</p>
                <p>However, much of my time in Nairobi was disappointing. I spent an awful lot of
                    time with the Kenyan Minister of Planning, who became a well respected friend.
                    However, he was caught, just as the aid donors were caught...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the whole political situation? Was there any corruption
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, very much so. The Kenyan Government was, in fact, using our
                    foreign exchange administrative system, set up at our expense, to “skim” margins
                    on foreign exchange. We never had the guts to stop these practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the aid donor community? Did you work with them
                        very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Less so. That was a period when I remember going to meetings, but I
                    don't know that much was accomplished. I don't feel that I took issues to be
                    discussed in the donor forum or paid much attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in any of the Consultative Group
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was pretty routine and predictable. Promises were made, and reports
                    were prepared and read. It was a period in the history of Kenya's relationship
                    with aid donors before things started coming to a head. Things were “bubbling.”
                    You could sort of see issues coming. People predicted that a showdown would
                    come. It was before the era of the presidential jet or the president's
                    skyscraper in Kenya. It was during the period of the Airbus “deal” and
                    corruption and the building of Karkana Dam, involving great cost and a lot of
                    corruption. It was a period of wildlife “poaching.” However, it was also a
                    period when there was a tourist “boom.” It was a period when Nairobi was still
                    known as a pleasant place to walk around in, but those days were clearly coming
                    to an end. It was a period when we started to plan the office “move” to new
                    quarters. This covered the period from 1983 to 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a REDSO [Regional Economic Development Service
                        Office] in town at the same time. Did you have any dealings with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Oh, they were sort of professional friendships, or maybe it was just my
                    engaging nature. I'm not sure. However, I thank my lucky stars that I said nice
                    things to all of them because when I became Mission Director later, it paid
                    dividends every which way I turned. I was very fortunate. I worked with the
                    FSN's [Foreign Service National, or national employees of the Mission] well and
                    with the American staff. Although I did not appreciate it at the time, that paid
                    dividends for four years in Tanzania and two years in Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the USAID Mission in Kenya use the REDSO very
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: As Program Officer I didn't have much to do with the REDSO. I think
                    that our technical people did. I didn't see that much of them. I spent a lot of
                    time with the Embassy and particularly with Embassy Economic Officers, dealing
                    with “conditionality” and reporting on the macroeconomic situation. I helped to
                    brief people coming through Kenya. I passed judgment on projects which were
                    either “cooked” or “not cooked.”</p>
                <p>I'll never forget a very important meeting with Chuck Gladson. Chuck swore up and
                    down that it was just a preliminary meeting to another meeting at which a
                    decision would then be made on a given issue. After the meeting I said to Chuck:
                    “Well, you did a nice job of approving that one.” He got really angry with me
                    for saying that. Six months later he came into my office and said: “Joe, you
                    were right.” The program had been approved, although nobody said so.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I think that one of the things that drove me away from being an economist is that
                    I gradually started to gain a sense that there were bureaucratic “games” going
                    on which acquired their own momentum. I learned how these systems really worked.
                    You think that you're in “control,” but you're not. It was very frustrating. I
                    grew to be very fond of Chuck Gladson. Allison Herrick was a bit distant at
                    first; the warmth and the stories come later. I worked closely with her and
                    learned about over control. Chuck was just a different kind of character. First
                    of all, he is a lawyer, a golfer, a smoker, and a Republican. I thought that,
                    clearly, I had nothing in common with this guy and I might as well pack my bags.
                    Well, it turned out to be completely the other way around. We talked a lot. We
                    didn't really socialize together in the evenings but, in the office, it was a
                    very strong relationship, which I enjoyed thoroughly. He would always come into
                    my office, which faced the setting sun side of the Union Tower building. We had
                    a lot of fine conversations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of how the USAID Mission
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Oh, I guess fairly well. The reason I say that, Haven, is not because I
                    knew whether it was working well or not. I just knew that I wasn't in Jakarta.
                    Jakarta was a “war zone.” There were nasty, nasty frictions, not involving me
                    but other people. And other people had ulcers, lay awake at night, there were
                    tears and aggravations around Niblock himself, the Program Officer, the Deputy
                    Program Officer. It was all very unpleasant. In retrospect and in many ways this
                    was one of the things that drove me in the management direction. I realized that
                    anybody could do a better job than these “turkeys.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than driving you away it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you have anything more to say about your
                        experience in Kenya at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A month at the Federal Executive Institute</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, during that time I attended a one-month training course at the
                    Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville. I was selected to go there. I
                    think that it was there that I saw a video recording, “In Search of Excellence.”
                    It contains an interview with Steven Jobs, wearing blue jeans. He has his feet
                    up on his desk. Somebody asked him: “Why would a bright, software designer like
                    you get into management?” Steven said just what I've just said. He said: “I
                    looked around and I figured that anybody could do a better job and I decided to
                    do it.” And at that point the light went on. I realized myself that I had made
                    the transition without realizing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I was lucky in Kenya. I got into a Program Officer job with a strong staff. I
                    could play to my own strengths and not be mired down in handbooks and details.
                    My relations with my staff were excellent. I'm still in touch with some of them.
                    Relations were very close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Federal Executive Institute program
                        for training people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: You have to wonder whether it's worth the Agency's money. With all of
                    the Agency's training, as you know better than I, we tend to “fire” people
                    rather than promote them. In the case of that one-month course at the Federal
                    Executive Institute it certainly was an eye-opener to the rest of the federal
                    system. It was a wonderful learning experience, just as the Senior Seminar in
                    the State Department was a wonderful learning experience. This was one of those
                    things where, if you have the money and the time, everybody who is moving up in
                    their career ought to be exposed to that kind of experience.</p>
                <p>If I had to put my finger on anything concrete that came out of this course, it
                    was that it reinforced my own feelings that “collegiality” works. A long time
                    ago in Dhaka Joe Toner, the USAID Mission Director, said: “Joe, the way to
                    manage is to give things away. You give away information, you give away rewards,
                    you give away decision-making authority. You just give it all away. That's how
                    you get rich.” I think I realized at the time that he was saying that first in
                    Kenya, then in Tanzania, and with the reinforcement of the Federal Executive
                    Institute course, I began to realize that, in my view, that management style was
                    very much what I wanted to aspire toward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then let's go on to your next assignment. You were now a
                        manager. What year was this that you made your next move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Appointment as USAID Mission Director in Tanzania - 1987</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It would have been early in 1987. I wanted to move on to a senior
                    management job. I had my heart set on the Deputy Mission Director position in
                    Kinshasa, [then Zaire, now Congo], for two reasons. I wanted to be “forced” to
                    learn French, so that I would have a second language. I wanted the management
                    experience of being a Deputy Mission Director.</p>
                <p>I talked to Dennis Chandler, but there was no warm relationship there. Later, I
                    found that I didn't get the position. At the time Chuck Gladson was talking to
                    Larry Saiers about a possible, future assignment for me. So my name came up
                    regarding an USAID mission that was almost closed, in Tanzania. At the time
                    there was a risk that the mission in fact would be closed, but there was a
                    tentative agreement with the International Monetary Fund, so AID would stay
                    open. So the business of closing the mission was basically held in abeyance,
                    subject to further negotiations with the IMF.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I agreed to go to Tanzania as the USAID Representative for a Mission that
                    supposedly had one person assigned to it. As I had been in Kenya, I was
                    interested in neighboring Tanzania. I was obviously delighted to be in charge. I
                    felt that, as I had been a Program Officer for four years in Kenya, I knew
                    something about USAID. I had worked very closely with the three USAID Mission
                    Directors in Kenya and knew the full range of things to do. Also, I knew about
                    relationships with the Embassy and all of the other U.S. agencies there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Tanzania at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Visually, it was like the last scene in the film, “On the Beach.” There
                    were broken windows, newspapers fluttering in the wind, dust, and the dead and
                    dying. It was still very quiet, very poor and desolate. The USAID Mission had
                    not been closed. I found that, as one of USAID's great secrets, they claimed
                    that the Mission had been closed. In fact, it was doing quite well. There were
                    about 40 FSN [Foreign Service National] employees. They were handling various
                    projects. There was a lot going on. It took me a little while to appreciate the
                    fact that there was a lot going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue which had put the USAID Mission in this
                        condition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The issue was whether the Tanzanians, for once, would stay “on board”
                    with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This time around they
                    did. So very gradually, step by step, and person by person, we rebuilt the USAID
                    Mission. Ultimately, it qualified as an USAID Mission, and I became an USAID
                    Mission Director. The budget gradually grew. I inherited some useful projects.
                    One of them was to support “TAZARA” [Tanzania-Zambia Railroad Authority].
                    Another was to support a roads program. We designed a family planning and a
                    scholarship program and terminated a Zanzibar malaria control project. During
                    all of this time I worked closely with Ambassador Peterson and then with
                    Ambassador de Garette. The assignment proved to be a very rewarding
                    experience.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights was to recognize that our FSN's had not had their salaries
                    adjusted for about 10 years. On average, their salaries were about 10 percent of
                    what State Department comparability reports claimed they should have been. It
                    took me three years to fight this issue through the State Department. However,
                    ultimately, I had the immense satisfaction of standing in front of our FSN
                    employees and telling them that they were about to get an average salary
                    increase of about 800 percent! I still get “thank you letters” for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine. Well, let's take some of these programs,
                        like family planning, for instance. Wasn't there a family planning program
                        before that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: The Tanzanians had kept family planning at arms length. There was no
                    public family planning program, but there was very modest public support for a
                    family planning NGO [Non Governmental Organization], called “UMATI” and
                    recognition of the leadership, what it took to keep that going through the “thin
                    years.” Other aid donors were involved in public health and a little bit of
                    family planning. I knew that I was there as an American diplomat and was
                    regarded by many senior Tanzanians with great suspicion. They wondered why we
                    were in Tanzania. Why did we support the “TAZARA” [Tanzania-Zambia Railroad
                    Authority]? Were our aid technicians just “spies”? Regarding family planning,
                    their attitude was that, “You guys are only interested in controlling our
                    numbers.” So I did not barge into family planning. However, I also knew
                    instinctively that somehow, some way, it would be very important to get a family
                    planning program going.</p>
                <p>My assistant, Paula Tavrow, was instrumental in working in the fields of health,
                    malaria, and scholarships. She got to know the Tanzanian health people and the
                    health aid donors very well. One fine day I was informally asked if I would come
                    to a family planning meeting if I was invited. I said that I certainly would.
                    Also, I was asked if I would agree to provide resources to support a family
                    planning program if a request for such resources were made. I said, “Absolutely.
                    Yes.”</p>
                <p>I checked this out with a key Tanzanian official, Peter Ngumbulu. Later, I was
                    invited to an informal meeting with the then Tanzanian Permanent Secretary for
                    Health. This all worked out. This is one of the stories I am most pleased with.
                    We knew that we would be working on a very sensitive subject. So we tried to
                    think of everything carefully, including how to approach groups and people, how
                    to deal with issues, how to pave the way, and how to make it very clear that we
                    didn't have any ulterior motive in supporting family planning.</p>
                <p>Part way through this process, Paula Tavrow's birthday came up. So we decided
                    that we were going to have a birthday party. We suggested to Paula that she
                    invite everybody that she had been working with. I asked Paula how many that
                    would be, so that my wife, Caroline, could plan for it. We thought that it would
                    amount to about 30 or 40 people. Well, about 200 people showed up! It was very
                    interesting. It turned out that it was the first time that all of these people
                    had gotten together. It was the first time for me to say, “Thanks” to
                    everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were all of these people Tanzanians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: They were mostly Tanzanians, with a few foreigners mixed in.</p>
                <p>All the while, well, I won't mention any names, but people in Washington were
                    calling me up on the telephone and saying, “Are you going to sign this family
                    planning agreement or lose the money?” In other words, they were saying, in
                    effect, “Get off your backside.”</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I stalled for one annual budget cycle. It wasn't until 18 months later that we
                    actually signed a $20 million program for Tanzanian family planning. The biggest
                    surprise about it and the most gratifying aspect of it was that by the time I
                    signed the agreement, I finally realized that we had 18 months of implementation
                    under our belt before the signing. The “collegial work” had really paid off. It
                    was all negotiated, understood, learned, and sorted out well in advance of the
                    signing ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the stress in the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was primarily the expansion of public sector supplies and services,
                    through the public system, to every nook and cranny of Tanzania, with a private
                    sector role through condom advertising and sales. At the time, we had been
                    “leading the charge” to pave the way. Anyway, at the time, one of the documents
                    that I signed was pm am jpmpraru or pro forma basis. That was for the
                    Demographic Health Survey (DHS). The thing that was so wonderful about that is
                    that, at the time, I knew that this was going to be a very major contribution,
                    because Tanzania was very proud of its “social achievements.” The truth of the
                    matter is that all of Tanzania's “social indicators” had gone to hell. The DHS
                    survey would document for the first time what was actually going on in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Sure enough, five years later, this survey documented the acceptance of family
                    planning. This proved a lot of things to me. One is that we don't need money to
                    handle development. Secondly, “collegiality” counts for a lot. Thirdly, you can
                    get results fast if you're all pulling in the right direction. So that was
                    pretty powerful stuff, and my time in Tanzania was a very rewarding time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the other sectors that you
                        worked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: One that I mostly inherited from Satish Shaw was a roads program. The
                    Tanzanian roads had gone to hell. They were all in the public sector. They were
                    all donor provided “turn key” roads. USAID and the World Bank had built some
                    roads twice and even three times. The government capacity to maintain the state
                    system of roads had just fallen apart. I don't recall how the first step to
                    improve this situation was taken. However, Satish and his “gang” visited
                    Tanzania before I arrived. One of the subjects that came up was the
                    privatization of roads.</p>
                <p>At some point somebody in the Ministry of Communications and Works must have
                    said: “We know that this is a mess. We know that we're to blame. Let's try
                    something else.” Satish presumably said: “Amen!”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: He was the Senior Project Officer in REDSO. I think that he later
                    became Director of REDSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In any event, Satish “latched on” to that wonderful opportunity. We put
                    together a roads program which was really a “feeder roads reform program” or a
                    “feeder roads privatization program.” The Ambassador and I went to see President
                    Mwinyi of Tanzania to explain what we had in mind. President Mwinyi said:
                    “Roads, roads, roads. I need roads and I don't care who builds them.” At this
                    point the Ambassador was kind enough to stand up and walk away, leaving me “to
                    feed the bear,” so to speak. So I got the pleasure of explaining to President
                    Mwinyi why it was so important for Tanzanians to be building their own roads,
                    rather than having foreigners doing that. The upshot of that meeting was
                    convincing President Mwinyi to go out on tour and see the roads for himself.</p>
                <p>President Mwinyi did this. He stood on the hood of his Land Rover and talked to
                    rural people. He said: “Years ago the Americans gave us food aid and then they
                    taught us how to grow our own food. Now they're teaching us to build our own
                    roads.” This program is a partial success. The World Bank is still building
                    “turn key” roads, and so are the ILO [International Labor Organization] and the
                    other aid donors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust of what you were trying to do in your
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was an effort to try a new way of building feeder roads. The
                    sequence of events was as follows. We used the promise of about $25 million to
                    reinforce the Tanzanian Government's commitment to experiment. Part of this
                    foreign exchange was used to support an American team in the Ministry of Works
                    to design a system of roads in which spare parts for road equipment were brought
                    into Tanzania . Under the USAID program, vehicle spare parts were purchased by
                    public and private entities. The cash value of those parts went into a fund to
                    pay private Tanzanian contractors to build and maintain feeder roads. So the
                    actual contract work was done only by local firms and was paid for out of the
                    cash paid for the imported spare parts.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Again, good luck counted for a lot. The Caterpillar Company [of Peoria, Illinois]
                    had been investing in Tanzania for years and years. They had 600 tractor
                    “carcases” in Tanzania but no foreign exchange to buy spare parts. All of a
                    sudden, Caterpillar equipment and that of other tractor makers were up and
                    running for the first time in many years. They were forever grateful for this
                    American program. The fact was that the owners of the broken-down tractors paid
                    Tanzanian shillingi [shillings] for the spare parts. The proceeds of the sales
                    went into the fund and made this program work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there private Tanzanian road-building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, that was the “hook.” The problem is that the big contractors were
                    Tanzanian Asians. However, we designed the road-building program in such a way
                    that there was a lot of subcontracting encouraged. My understanding is that, at
                    any one time, there were 30 or 40 Tanzanian subcontractors that worked on
                    segments of the roads. This involved the construction or repair of culverts,
                    grading, clearing, and so forth. So this represented a start on black-owned
                    Tanzanian small businesses repairing the road network.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons, to be perfectly frank, why Tanzanian President Mwinyi was
                    happy to let the World Bank build roads on a turn key basis was that he got sick
                    and tired of paying all of that money to Tanzanian Asians. It was the old
                    dilemma. He had been suspicious of commerce and industry run by minority groups
                    in Tanzania during his whole career, as business tended to go “offshore.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that road development program associated with the big
                        World Bank loan of $800 million? Was this what they called the “sector
                        program approach?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, it was part of that. However, I don't think that the World Bank
                    showed much willingness to be innovative. I think that most of this program was
                    handled on a turn key basis. I could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong in that
                    regard.</p>
                <p>In the case of family planning the cooperation approach worked very well. When we
                    get to Zambia, I can tell you a similar story. In the case of the road building
                    program people would say the right things at meetings, but in practice they were
                    mostly interested in spending “their” money on hiring “their” contractors. They
                    didn't really much care about Tanzanian ownership or sustainability. It was
                    disheartening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of aid donors involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: There sure were. There were easily a dozen aid donors. I cite the
                    example of the ILO having 10 expatriates out on a works project supervising
                    Tanzanian workers. That's the kind of unsustainability which I find appalling.
                    We had one foreigner and one only. He sat in the ministry, not with us. He was
                    out in the field most of the time. The Tanzanians loved him dearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other programs in Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I used the collegial approach in a different kind of decision. I
                    “terminated” USAID's last malaria control program. I worked hard with the
                    Zanzibaris, with my staff, and with experts in and out of Tanzania to figure out
                    what this malaria control project was contributing. The answer was, “Zero.”
                    Nobody had the courage to “turn it off,” so I went ahead and turned it off
                    myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why wasn't it contributing to the control of malaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, because in the “bad old days” the malaria control program
                    required a military kind of program to mobilize people, spray villages, drain
                    culverts, and so forth. Furthermore, mosquitoes had become partially resistant
                    to DDT. The mosquito parasite was partially resistant to chloroquin. The
                    Zanzibari project officer was busy using the vehicles and money for his own,
                    personal use for his houses. Also, I believe he had “burned his bridges” with
                    his own political structure in Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Zanzibari?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. In a situation like this, Haven, I found that we were simply
                    carrying all of the “water.” I had a fine Project Officer who were carrying all
                    of the burden. I found that thoroughly unbecoming. We spent about a year and a
                    half, trying to move the burden back into the hands of the Zanzibaris. This
                    simply did not work. They just assumed that they'd get everything that they
                    wanted and perform on none of the requirements. I finally decided that “enough
                    was enough.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I found terminating this project painful to do. However, it was a period when
                    people were starting to talk about “impregnated bed nets” and, of course, a
                    malaria vaccine which has yet to be developed. It was at that time that Mike
                    Wallace came to town. I gave Mike 90 minutes of tape. Thank goodness for me, he
                    boiled that down to 22 seconds. He was a little flabbergasted that I was
                    prepared to turn off a malaria program, when babies were dying like flies across
                    Africa and still are. I also turned off a Title II program through Catholic
                    Relief Service. Again, I spent a lot of time with staff in the field and with
                    the Ambassador, checking all of the strategic points. I found that this program
                    was mostly political, not nutritional, not allocated on the basis of need. There
                    was some corruption. CRS' [Catholic Relief Service] own director in Tanzania had
                    tried to turn off this program. She had been shot down by CRS headquarters. I
                    inherited this mess and decided to turn this program off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems in doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Not as much as I expected. In that particular case the phone did not
                    ring. Our Ambassador was tired of being “poked in the eye” by other Ambassadors
                    who “goosed us” over dumping food aid. People knew that it was Catholic Church
                    politics involved.</p>
                <p>In Indonesia one of the things that I forgot to mention is that I put a lot of
                    time into an evaluation of a CRS-operated, Title II program. I found that it was
                    quite disappointing. I'm sure that you're aware that on the health side of
                    things there is a lot of empirical capacity to evaluate the impact of
                    nutritional interventions. So it's fairly easy to say “Yea” or “Nay” to a
                    particular program. This was not inherently because of Title II. However, Title
                    II, plus CRS, led to a rather costly and ineffective program. I admired the CRS
                    representative greatly for having taken the stand that she did before I got to
                    Tanzania. I felt that, finally, I had to honor her original decision to close
                    this program down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other, food assistance programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. We took the Title II program and “monetized” it to liberalize the
                    food and grain trade. Quite frankly, that effort was not successful. Later on,
                    we decided not to extend it, because the Tanzanian Government did not have the
                    budgetary discipline to deposit the money for food grain landed in Tanzania.
                    This was quite a disappointment. It should have alerted me to the weaknesses of
                    the banking system. I guess that it alerted me to other problems that I got into
                    later on. That was a pilot program that did not work.</p>
                <p>Since then, I think that the Tanzanians have liberalized their grain trade. Maybe
                    we planted a seed that took root, although this is hard to say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there regional parts of the aid program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Because of the racist regime in South Africa, the U.S. Congress, USAID,
                    and the State Department developed close ties and a special program for the
                    so-called “front line” states [i.e., countries close to or bordering on South
                    Africa]. Tanzania's share of this was $50 million. Actually, we had access to up
                    to $50 million. I think that Allison Herrick and others in Washington were
                    having a hard time trying to figure out how to spend the money. Satish Shaw had
                    sent a team down to talk to TAZARA and look at possible USAID support. The team
                    figured out that they needed some parts and a lot of management to “clean up”
                    this binational, parastatal entity. Well, that wasn't good enough. Allison said:
                    “Well, you've got to spend some money.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a parastatal company for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I'm sorry. The TAZARA railroad line was built by the Chinese. It
                    connected the Zambian copper mines with the port of Dar Es Salaam, so that
                    Zambia would not have to rely on rail lines that passed through South Africa to
                    export copper. The binational, parastatal company has been jointly owned and
                    operated all this time and still is. The railroad was Chinese-built and
                    equipped. By this time their locomotives were worn out. There were some German
                    “re-engineered” locomotives, but basically what the railroad really needed was
                    to be privatized and commercialized. However, they didn't take that step.</p>
                <p>Because of political pressures we decided that we had to spend money on procuring
                    new locomotives. There were several, unrecorded phone calls in which Satish Shaw
                    was simply ordered to buy new locomotives. The regional team had said that it
                    would be unwise to bring in locomotives under these circumstances. However, we
                    all know USAID. I landed in Tanzania in time to sign an agreement for 17 new
                    locomotives.</p>
                <p>In this context I learned more about being a PDO than I ever wanted to learn. On
                    the personal, as well as the professional side, it was necessary for me to learn
                    about railroads and railroad management and technology. It was absolutely
                    fascinating. I met some wonderful Tanzanians and am still in touch with them. I
                    am very proud of the relationships that I built up. Sadly, this railroad is
                    still a mismanaged, parastatal entity. There still is not much justification for
                    the locomotives. However, to see something real land...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the locomotives are still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: They are there, and half of them are in use. The rest have been
                    wrecked. I've been back to Tanzania since then. I've stayed in touch with the
                    Tanzanian side of the railroad by virtue of being in Lusaka [Zambia]. I went
                    back to see friends, see the locomotives, and see the workshop that we built in
                    the southwest corner of Tanzania. From such visits I learned, grudgingly, that
                    the locomotives were not being well maintained. This was a source of great
                    disappointment. A well-maintained locomotive can last for at least 50 years.</p>
                <p>The sad truth of the matter is that the economies of both Zambia and Tanzania,
                    having enjoyed their “socialist experiment,” have been “trashed.” The load
                    factor for the railroad has remained a very small fraction of what it was
                    projected to be. So the demand for the locomotives never really grew to meet the
                    new “load.” The new locomotives filled in for the older ones that were being
                    “trashed.” Now, the new locomotives are being “trashed,” in turn, and so I'm not
                    sure who's going to be the next “sucker” to supply new locomotives. Q: Just to
                    keep the railroad going.</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But our side built a road, and it wasn't that perfect, was
                        it, at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We did. There was a race. Not surprisingly, there was privatization of
                    truck traffic, and privately owned trucks were allowed to circulate on the
                    highway during this whole period. We built a road, as you know better than I,
                    which was literally “neck and neck” with the construction of the railroad.</p>
                <p>There's a wonderful story about a crossing where the road was supposed to cross
                    the railroad, which the Chinese were building. Apparently, one of the Americans
                    working on building the road had a bulldozer which was in the way of a Chinese
                    survey engineer, who happened to be a woman. She asked the American to move his
                    bulldozer. He didn't move it. So the story goes that she went over and “slugged”
                    him! Maybe because of surprise, she knocked him on his rear. The story has it
                    that he up and left the construction site. He couldn't take this. Anyway, that
                    story is still famous. The crossing is still known as the site of this
                    incident.</p>
                <p>I have to stay, on the personal side, that I lived in China as a kid. My parents
                    stayed in touch with China, and my brother speaks Chinese fluently. My working
                    with the Chinese who worked for TAZARA [Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority] was a
                    wonderful experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I will gloss over the signing ceremony for the subsequent procurement of American
                    locomotives for this railroad. This project was worth some $46 million. The
                    Tanzanian and Zambian Governments said that they would not sign the agreement,
                    which had to be signed during the last week of the U.S. fiscal year, or the
                    allocation of the money would become invalid. The Tanzanians and Zambians had
                    $46 million “swinging in the breeze.” I found out that the reason for the delay
                    was suspicion of Americans. They wondered why the U.S. would want to send
                    technicians to work on a Chinese built railroad. Key Tanzanians and Zambians had
                    suspicion of our motives. The Ambassador and I had to spend a lot of time
                    convincing them. We said: “You people approve the 'scope' agreements. You know
                    what they're doing. We are not here to 'spy' on you, the Chinese or anybody
                    else.” The Tanzanians and Zambians finally signed on the last day of the U.S.
                    fiscal year. USAID Washington had been “beside itself” over the delay.</p>
                <p>Two days before the signature of the agreement, somebody in the Tanzanian
                    Government finally said to me: “Joe, you've been patient with us, and your
                    patience is going to 'pay off.' We will sign the agreement.” Boy, it was
                    close!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know that situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: The relationships with the Chinese worked quite well, partly because of
                    my own background. I went out of my way to meet them and involve them in
                    everything. When there were ceremonies, they were right there. So that was a
                    very nice experience.</p>
                <p>Sadly, they saw the railroad as we see it today. They saw mismanagement and felt
                    terrible disappointment over this project, despite the huge investment that they
                    had made in it. It was truly an heroic feat of Chinese engineering in Africa. No
                    doubt about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now the circumstances have changed, and so forth, so
                        the demand for the use of the railroad is not as great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. I've written about this in the chapter on African
                    agriculture in my book. That rail line still runs through a gorgeous part of
                    Africa. Some day all of those little stations will be bustling, booming market
                    towns. It won't happen in this century, but it may happen by the middle of the
                    21st century. The railway line itself is “indestructible.” There is a trained
                    cadre of Tanzanians and Zanzibarians working on it. Administrative and
                    management rules, in some cases, with respect to the desired labor conditions,
                    are set in law. It will take another generation of political courage to relax
                    those rules.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Anyway, one of the “thrills” of that particular assignment to Tanzania was to be
                    able to stand on the beach in Dar Es Salaam, knowing that the ship with the
                    American locomotives aboard was about to come over the horizon. Sure enough, it
                    did. It came right at us and turned into the harbor. The next morning we went
                    down to the port and watched the American locomotives being unloaded. There was
                    a great ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't get into any procurement difficulties in the
                        purchase of the locomotives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Oh, thank you for raising that! I was lucky in that I recruited Zach
                    Hahn and then John Starnes as PDO's [Project Development Officers]. We did two
                    things. We made sure that the locomotives were precisely what the Tanzanians
                    wanted for the railroad. The technical specifications we received from the
                    railroad were lengthy. The chief engineer for TAZARA was Lucas Chogo. Without a
                    doubt he was the technical brains of the whole operation. He wrote and
                    negotiated those specifications so that we knew precisely what TAZARA's needs
                    were. Having said that, thanks to Zach Hahn and to John Starnes, we also worked
                    to set forth “generic” specifications for the locomotives, so that there would
                    not be any arbitrary “bias” toward either GE [General Electric] or GM [General
                    Motors].</p>
                <p>Again, we had good luck in that we had negotiated those first two sets of
                    requirements very carefully. GM and GE both thanked us later for the quality of
                    the work of preparing the specifications. More because of luck than anything
                    else, GM was “flooded” with orders, and GE was not. The GE bid was well below
                    GM's bid, so it was an “open and shut” case. However, as I was USAID Mission
                    Director at the time, this was one of the few times that I felt that this was
                    like a “shoot out at OKAY Corral.” I got to cut the seals. I got to look down
                    the line and see the costs. It was a little nerve-wracking because we knew full
                    well that many of these large contracts were contested. However, in this
                    particular case good homework and good, commercial relationships between the two
                    company representatives at that time explained why this was a “peaceful
                    agreement.” The agreement was completed, there were no contests, and there were
                    no “hitches.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly with the American attitude and a potential
                        Canadian involvement...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Quite honestly, I think that GE and GM would have chosen a Canadian
                    place of final assembly, using American made components. Anyway, it gave me an
                    excuse to join Lucas Chogo and go to the GE plant in Erie [PA] and see the
                    locomotives being assembled. It was quite impressive. It was very exciting, and
                    I was very proud to see how the African engineers were being trained and how
                    they put the “final touches” on the locomotives when they arrived in
                    Tanzania.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In the aid business there are always wonderful stories to tell. They are never
                    the whole story, but at least there are things to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, are there any other dimensions to the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I should mention my wife Caroline. We had “inherited” a famous German
                    mansion to live in. We also inherited the strained relationships between
                    Tanzanian socialism and American capitalism. Caroline and I sensed that we
                    needed to spend a lot of time on official “representation” activities. So, over
                    the course of four years in Tanzania Caroline organized and ran about 400
                    business get-togethers, receptions, parties, breakfasts, and luncheons. I have
                    to say that USAID Washington and the State Department didn't even bother sending
                    us a “thank you” letter for these efforts. I know that this is typical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These social events were for whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: They were for Tanzanians, for our development work in Tanzania. You
                    know as well as I that this is a very common story with USAID spouses,
                    worldwide. They put in an immense amount of work and deserve a lot of credit. In
                    fact, I wrote up a cable nominating Caroline for an award, but that didn't go
                    anywhere, either. That's a “sour note” but only one “sour note” in what was
                    otherwise an incredibly good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were a Mission Director now. Now that you had
                        finally arrived as a manager, what did you think about being a manager?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I thought it was glorious, absolutely glorious! At the time and now I
                    would be happy to say that if I had known that it was going to be so exciting, I
                    might have been ambitious! I had never had any interest in being an USAID
                    Mission Director. I did not know that this job could be so interesting, so
                    challenging, and so rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, perhaps this is time for a pause. Is there anything
                        else regarding your Tanzanian experience that you would like to mention?
                        What was the economic situation at that time in Tanzania? How did you relate
                        to that more generally? You were an “old hand” in the economic policy
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: The Embassy Economic Officer and I, as well as an FSN economist,
                    followed and reported on the macroeconomic situation. We worked with
                    representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. We were
                    not “big time players” but we certainly had a point of view as to what was
                    working and what was not working. Very slow progress was being made. In
                    retrospect, I think that you'd have to say that there was precious little
                    progress. Tanzania is still finding it very hard to move ahead. There are
                    frequent interruptions in the supply of water and electric power. Investment,
                    and particularly foreign investment, is very modest. It's been a very tough time
                    for Tanzania since independence in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why has it had so much economic difficulty, compared to
                        other African countries which seem to have been torn apart with ethnic
                        crises and so forth? Tanzania has been free of that, yet still can't move
                        along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Maybe the seeds of corruption and disillusionment, and maybe more of
                    the latter than the former, have “disemboweled” the bureaucracy in Tanzania.
                    However, their mistrust of Tanzanian Asians prevailed, and there was tension
                    with Zanzibar. Despite the fact that the Tanzanians are very agreeable people,
                    possibly they are just too “relaxed.” It's very hard to know why this should be
                    so. It was instructive to have served previously in Kenya and to feel, as a
                    white “European” in Africa for the first time, that the Kenyans tended to “hate”
                    me because of the very fact that I was a white. Therefore, I should just have
                    learned to live with that. At the end of my first six months in Kenya, I
                    concluded that that wasn't true. The fact was that the Kenyans really hated the
                    Kenya Asians. The Kenyans weren't really focused on the Europeans. I thought
                    that they hated the Asians. That explained the level of animosity that I
                    sensed.</p>
                <p>By the end of the first of my four years in Kenya, I decided that I was wrong
                    again and that the Kenyans really hated each other. They didn't have time to
                    waste, hating Europeans or Asians, because the tribal friction within Kenya was
                    so severe. I tell that story purposely because, after living in Tanzania and
                    then in Zambia, it was like night and day, being in a country where the people
                    were so congenial, friendly, warm, and sincere. However, all of that natural
                    “resource,” if you will, doesn't get turned into mobilizing growth.</p>
                <p>One of the many tragedies that befell Tanzania was that Julius Nyerere had
                    decided that the Tanzanians were not going to be “money grubbing,” middle class
                    people. The Asians living in Tanzania would be tolerated to handle trade and
                    commerce, while ethnic Tanzanians would be rural and communal in their outlook.
                    They would only train enough Tanzanian students through secondary school and the
                    universities to supply the few, civil servant positions needed. For that reason
                    Tanzania actively discouraged secondary school education. To this day Tanzania
                    still has the lowest, secondary school enrollment of eligible students of any
                    country in the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It's true, even though it's an appalling fact which describes the
                    penalty that is paid by some of this “economic philosophy.” To be crude and
                    fair, I think that most of the aid donors, most of the time, subscribe to this
                    philosophy. This view even included USAID. In the case of USAID, subscription to
                    this philosophy may have gone on for fewer years than in the case of other aid
                    donors, but the fact is that we were there, too, supporting this socialist
                    “Paradise on earth.” We were doing rural development and all sorts of things
                    which were basically state-controlled. On reflection, it was not a pretty
                    picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the World Bank also subscribe to this view, from the
                        early days and through the time that McNamara was its President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have the massive investments supported that outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. Now they're faced with, not only corruption, but HIV/AIDS
                    [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] and international debt. And this pertains
                    to a country that is inherently rich, wealthy, diverse, and wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And relatively at peace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Absolutely. Tanzania is more than at peace. Tanzanians are justifiably
                    proud of the work that they do to keep peace in the region. You may not agree
                    with all of it, but the truth of the matter is that they spend the resources
                    that they don't have to look after refugees and foster peace in Uganda, Burundi,
                    Rwanda, and Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you would attribute to Nyerere's socialist approach
                        the “dampening down” of a more entrepreneurial approach to development that
                        you found in other places? Do you think that this is the reason why the
                        people are not more entrepreneurial, compared to other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. This probably says more about me than anything I've ever learned.
                    I just had a unique belief that the entrepreneurial spirit is evenly distributed
                    around the world. I think that, depending on parents, culture, and educational
                    and market systems, this spirit is reinforced or discouraged as the case may be.
                    I've met plenty of Tanzanians who are full of life and would “blossom” in a
                    market economy. On the other hand, if a government spends more than 20 years
                    putting that spirit down, inevitably there's going to be an impact. Tanzania may
                    yet be one of the few cases where the impact of this effort is basically
                    devastating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you made the point that there is such a small
                        percentage of young people in secondary schools. I suppose that that concept
                        then applies at the university level. Everybody says that education is
                        really the “power” in a society that drives the economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If education has really been “dampened” down, is that a
                        major factor in the results in Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think so. The donor aid program in Tanzania is huge. We all spend
                    very large amounts of money on foreigners, not Tanzanians. The money is tied to
                    debt repayments and to importing commodities. Very little of the money actually
                    goes to institution building or rebuilding the spirit of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were not involved in an education program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: No. As I recall, I actively kept us out of agriculture and education,
                    because I considered them to be such a nightmare that I could not compete with
                    other donors who were funding what I thought were the wrong things. I couldn't
                    possibly reform the Tanzanian Government. That was not the case in Zambia where,
                    I found, the time was more than ripe to get into the health field because there
                    was a systemic change under way. In Zambia we were involved in health and
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p>However, in the case of Tanzania, it was easy for me as USAID Mission Director,
                    with a limited budget, to find reasons for staying out of agriculture and
                    education. I think that there were good reasons. USAID Directors and programs
                    are marvelous at getting into things more deeply than they should. Yet,
                    sometimes, even a little “seed money” can go a long way. And USAID Directors
                    “love” that sort of world. I think that it's one of the nice things about USAID
                    generally and about the USAID presence in a given country. You see opportunities
                    where one trip, one scholarship, one adviser, or one idea may not amount to
                    much. On the other hand, sometimes it does.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've been in Tanzania for a long time. Were there any
                        remnants left over from previous USAID programs? There must be something
                        hanging around that showed some results.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, and there was a lot of pressure on me to fund agricultural
                    training, extension, and universities, because we had done this in the past. In
                    fact, the only time I ever received a direct “order” to do anything in USAID was
                    from Charles Gladson, then Assistant Administrator in the African Bureau, to
                    sign an agreement between Sokoni Agricultural University and Tuskegee Institute.
                    My staff and I felt that there wasn't much in such an agreement to contribute
                    much one way or the other. However, I was “ordered” to sign the agreement, and
                    so we did it.</p>
                <p>I cite that as an example. You can work in USAID for 25 years, most of the time
                    overseas, and survive, if you will, or at least “do well,” receiving only one
                    order like that. It's a remarkable commentary on the USAID system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an agreement between Tuskegee Institute and

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Sokoni Agricultural University, the Tanzanian agricultural
                    university.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this involve the training of faculty members of

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, faculty training and exchange arrangements between the two
                    universities, plus a little bit of “overhead.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Oh, my, what else? After I left Tanzania, my successors got involved in
                    democracy, through the funding of “political” NGO's [Non Governmental
                    Organizations].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: However, apart from the roads program, you weren't
                        involved in any private sector initiatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: We laid the foundations for them but we did not get involved. Again, I
                    looked at it and felt that it was premature for any such initiative really to
                    work. The foreign exchange system had not been liberalized. The banking system
                    was collapsing. The investment code was state-run, if you will. Let me give you
                    an example. The Tanzanian Government was very proud of its investment center and
                    its Investment Director, and they displayed this gentleman around Dar Es Salaam.
                    However, if you went to the Investment Center, the Director would say: “See all
                    of these projects sitting on the floor? All you have to do is pick one.” That's
                    all I needed to know. No, I just didn't see the point of that.</p>
                <p>The country's overhead just continued to collapse. Private business in Tanzania,
                    to this day, has a very hard time keeping generators and electric power going.
                    Piped water is running short. The Japanese rebuilt all of the roads in Dar Es
                    Salaam. These roads are now full of potholes, less than five years after they
                    were rebuilt. It's kind of disheartening. There are disputes with Zanzibar which
                    consume a lot of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact at all with Nyerere? He was not
                        President at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I never met him and had no contact with him. I personally didn't seek
                    contact. I guess that I felt that he was sufficiently to blame for the problems
                    of Tanzania. I didn't feel inclined to go and get his autograph, or anything
                    like that.</p>
                <p>I have to tell you a Nyerere story through the eyes of his chief “buddy” from
                    Edinburgh of Fabian socialist days, Joan Wicken. Joan followed Nyerere back to
                    Tanzania after he was a student in Great Britain and served as his confidante
                    and personal secretary for years and years. I heard a lot about her and thought
                    that the least I could do was to go and say “Hello” to her. I had a marvelous
                    time. She was as lovely to meet as anybody's favorite aunt, until she opened her
                    mouth. Then you got quite a blast about the glories of socialism and the dangers
                    of capitalism. I said to myself: “Well, I've managed to step on all of the land
                    mines,” and I thought that I'd get onto a safe subject. So I started to talk
                    about computers and their value in modernizing Tanzania. She said: “No way.
                    Computers put people out of work, and, besides, Tanzania is about to be
                    self-sufficient in typewriters.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, it was lovely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I gather that they're going into computers now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: She had one on her desk. At this stage in world history growth in
                    Tanzania should be like India, not only assembling computers but writing the
                    software. They're not. India has a revolution going, writing software. This is a
                    wonderful story. I wish I knew more about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the food situation in Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I would have to say that it is pretty good. Tanzania has many different
                    “crop zones.” In that climatic diversity is safety for the food supply. They
                    have liberalized marketing, trucking, and storage controls, so I think that
                    prices now rule more than they used to. My impression is that, although harvests
                    are still subject to the rains, generally speaking Tanzania is in a good
                    situation with regard to food. Tanzania came to Zambia's rescue in late 1995.
                    The Zambian Government in Lusaka was wringing its hands over the scarcity of
                    food at that time and turned to the traditional aid donors for help. They found
                    that the Tanzanians had a huge harvest in Southwest Tanzania, right on the
                    border with Zambia, as did the South Africans. So those private deals to
                    purchase food ultimately served Zambia well. Of course, there needs to be a
                    great deal more of such private trading.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you care to mention on your Tanzanian
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Oh, I have a lot of personal and developmental stories. Unlike in
                    Kenya, while I was in Tanzania, I tried to get out into the country on business
                    trips. I had the excuse of following the development of the “TAZARA”
                    [Tanzania-Zambia] railroad and the roads. I went to Zanzibar several times in
                    connection with the malaria control program to try to understand that myself. I
                    went to Sokoni University two or three times to meet with people. I was involved
                    in emergency seed distribution and drought relief, just to see, at first hand,
                    what the problems looked like.</p>
                <p>I managed an office move, which was a very nice, personal experience. I pretended
                    to handle this collegially, but the truth of the matter is that I didn't do
                    that. I designed the floor plan in such a way that the Tanzanian staff and
                    secretaries would have their fair share of windows and light. I enjoyed doing
                    that for my USAID Mission. I was also able to have wood paneling installed on
                    the walls, which looked very good. The office is in the airlines building. It
                    was a nice experience to “map out” the space involved, so that form would follow
                    function and seniority according to substantive criteria, and not according to
                    whether you were American or Tanzanian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I left Tanzania in June, 1991. We were very fortunate to be able to
                    spend that return trip, visiting our “hometown” in China. I had never been back
                    since we had left it. My brother had since married and had a child. He and his
                    family, and my wife, children, and I met in Hong Kong, took the train to
                    Changsha, and then a bus from Changsha into Shaoyang. We saw the house where I
                    had lived as a child. I remembered it very well. We met friends of the family.
                    Altogether, it was a most amazing experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the situation in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was very different. In the house where we had lived as a single
                    family there must have been 50 people living there. In the streets that I
                    remember vividly as muddy and poor there are now bars and karaoke cafes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a form of economic development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Absolutely. Our compound had been rural, surrounded by a bamboo fence
                    and rice fields. Today there is not a single rice field in sight. The area
                    around our former house is now entirely industrialized and urbanized. Anyway, it
                    was a marvelous chance to go back. We went from Shaoyang to Xian to see the
                    “terra cotta” army. We went to Beijing, where my brother and sister-in-law
                    worked. So we were well cared for and got invited around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, after that experience, what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A year in the Senior Seminar - 1991</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I wanted to come back to Washington to be the chief economist for a
                    greatly reduced position and office filled with economists. The day I got back
                    to PPC [Program Office]...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this job was in PPC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. The day I got back, I found that my proposed job, my officers, and
                    my office had all been abolished. I knew what USAID Washington thought of
                    economists but I thought that that was just a little extreme. In any event, I
                    have to say that, before I could even bother to get upset about this, Peter
                    Bloom came to my rescue by suggesting to somebody who mattered that what Joe
                    Stepanek ought to do is to go to the Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy at the
                    State Department. Talk about manna from heaven! That was the most amazing
                    experience. It was quite beyond words. So I had hardly gotten off the plane from
                    Dar Es Salaam and China when I found myself on a Boeing 727 in Alaska. I had a
                    very fascinating nine months in the Senior Seminar. I learned a great deal.
                    Sadly enough, I learned most of it virtually at the end of my career in USAID,
                    but such is life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was so unique about the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, the part of it that was special for me and, I think, for other
                    USAID people who attend it, is that USAID people came out of the Kennedy and
                    Vietnam era when there was high idealism and a high level of suspicion of the
                    U.S. military. Maybe I'm generalizing it unfairly, as I do this on the basis of
                    a sample of two people. My friend and I, who have attended the Senior Seminar,
                    both agree that our respect for the U.S. military skyrocketed as a result of
                    this experience. Our respect for the State Department stayed about where it was
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you knew the State Department better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, we knew it better. We also got to rub shoulders with people from
                    the U.S. military and the intelligence community, which was all very valuable
                    and very interesting. If you're going to continue to work for the federal
                    government, clearly those contacts and that knowledge are essential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was substantively useful about the Senior
                        Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Chief of the Development Planning Office, Latin America Bureau - 1992</p>
                <p>STEPANEK: From the Senior Seminar I went to the Latin America Bureau of USAID in
                    LADP [Latin American Country Development Planning]. I drew on my experience from
                    the Senior Seminar to understand U.S. military involvement in Latin America and
                    how the U.S. military saw Latin American development. I was surprised and
                    gratified to find that the U.S. military plans its programs in Latin America
                    very much the way USAID does. That is, poverty is the root cause of the trouble,
                    and so forth. I found that gratifying.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>While I was in Zambia, I don't recall drawing on this experience very much. It is
                    only when I am writing now that I find that the experience has broadened my
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write a paper for the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I did. I wrote a draft on USAID legislation reform. I forget now what I
                    said. In preparation for writing it, I spent a month up on Capitol Hill. After
                    the Senior Seminar experience, I went off to the Latin America Bureau of USAID
                    for two years. This was an educational experience but probably not very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1992?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: This was from 1992 to 1994, first under Jim Michael. It was very nice
                    to know and work with him. He faced his own “60 Minutes” crisis. I also worked
                    for the late Eric Zallman and many other, very fine people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I was head of a DP [Development Planning] office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some initiative that you were trying to take?
                        What was going on then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Closing USAID Missions, I suppose, is one thing that I had to watch.
                    There were lots of audits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we closing USAID Missions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: This was budget driven. During the period 1992 to 1995, the U.S.
                    Government cut USAID resources and PL 480 resources for Latin America by about
                    two-thirds. That meant “winding down” staff and some offices. This happened even
                    before the pressure caused by the arrival of Bryan Atwood and Larry Byrnes. So I
                    helped to “carry the water” a little bit. I joined Carol Lancaster in Costa
                    Rica, for instance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a particular approach to mission programs that
                        you took?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I wish there had been such an approach, Haven. The truth of the matter
                    is that all of the discussion about “transition models” was basically put aside.
                    There seemed to be a willingness to talk about it, but not enough to act. Quite
                    frankly, I think that the feeling was that within USAID it would be easy to
                    reach agreement on transitions, but this would never “sell” on Capitol Hill,
                    because it always looked like an “end run.” All they were interested in on
                    Capitol Hill was the “count.” An USAID Mission either was closed or not closed.
                    Bodies assigned to them were either “in” or “out.” There were no two ways about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Quite frankly, USAID doesn't have the stature “within the Beltway” [that is, in
                    Washington, DC] to have carried a transition program convincingly. From my point
                    of view this would have required close cooperation with OMB [Office of
                    Management and Budget], Treasury, the Department of Commerce, and other
                    government departments to be a really effective, transition program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That could have been billed particularly as a “middle
                        income” strategy for a program relationship on Capitol Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This did not come to any conclusion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Not that I'm aware of. Now we all know that USAID Missions don't always
                    close when they claim that they're going to be closed. So there is a number of
                    USAID offices in Latin America which are “one person” offices. I don't know that
                    there are any offices that are “no person” offices. There are models in which
                    you have a relationship in a given country but no person assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there are continuing USAID relationships with, what,
                        Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, I believe so. These offices haven't actually closed. My personal
                    strategy with respect to Costa Rica was to say: “You, sir, are under a direct
                    order from Carol Lancaster and Larry Byrnes to close this Mission. Do so. We
                    both know privately that it will not close, but let other people carry 'those
                    coals' for you.” I think that's what they did, because we are all “short timers”
                    in a sense, and the relationships between our country and developing countries
                    will be sustained in one way or another. Literal “closure” of an USAID Mission
                    seldom happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they close the Mission in Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I don't believe that it's closed yet, although I may be wrong. You've
                    aroused my curiosity. There's no office in San Jose with a senior FSN [Foreign
                    Service National] employee in charge, or an USAID function performed by the
                    Embassy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't swear to that, but they're acting as if the
                        Mission has been closed. We have this other approach, and I shouldn't be
                        talking, but in some of these countries they use Central Bureau resources to
                        generate strategy. Whether this was something in your approach...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's right. Not that I liked this very much, but conceptually it is
                    an important approach.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I spent two years on budget and audit management, pressures for closure,
                    and worried a good bit about the situation in Haiti. I visited Haiti once, got
                    to the Dominican Republic once, but did not get to South America,
                    unfortunately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sense of the Latin American Bureau of
                        USAID at that time? What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, it was the famous “empire” that everybody claimed that it was,
                    with very talented people working there. Eric Zallman was the kind of fellow
                    who, like Norma Parker and a few others, knew not only every project but every
                    program, position, and everybody who has been in every position from the very
                    beginning. If you think you're going to compete with them, you should just think
                    again, because you're not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I'm glad that I learned about my own hemisphere, although in some ways
                    I suppose that it was a waste of the time of the Latin America Bureau, as well
                    as my own time. I felt really pressed to swim in that sea. I guess that I made
                    some small contributions. The Bureau got high marks from Larry Byrnes for
                    closing down audits. I think that we got high marks for being “transparent” in
                    our budget analyses. Also, I managed to hit it off personally with Dick McCall
                    very well. He was part of the new team coming in. In some ways it was a
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any Congressional activity at that time? Were
                        you...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: The one time that I did, it was a “bust,” because I shared planning
                    year numbers with people on Capitol Hill, by mistake. And that is a “No, no.” I
                    was duly embarrassed and sheepish over that. I am much too straightforward a
                    person ever to deal with the people on Capitol Hill. Other people who had been
                    doing that for years “knew the ropes,” and that's fine.</p>
                <p>USAID Mission Director in Zambia - 1994</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, after that you went off to Zambia, was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: For the first time in my life I found that my next step in USAID was
                    one that I sought for myself. All of the other assignments had started with
                    phone calls to me.</p>
                <p>I started at that late date in my career to realize that my “career clock” was
                    ticking and that I'd better think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean, you were about to be affected by the “time in
                        grade” rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. And I recall talking to McDonald, the chief executive officer in
                    the Personnel Office, on several occasions about what was going to be available
                    for me. I guess that, according to policy, he was very open and very helpful. I
                    had a very good idea of what was coming and had a chance to think about it.</p>
                <p>I wanted to be USAID Mission Director in Jordan, but that was not in the cards.
                    Then I turned my attention to Africa because I knew Africa and felt comfortable
                    there. I had the choice between Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. It didn't take any
                    time at all to realize that I much preferred Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, first of all, I didn't know that country at all, and I knew the
                    other two countries. I also knew that there were the beginnings of a political
                    and economic reform program in Zambia. I found that exciting. So, with no
                    “campaigning” on my part, the SMG [Senior Management Group] approved my name for
                    this appointment. My appointment as USAID Mission Director to Zambia went
                    forward, and that worked well. It was a very exciting two years.</p>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I arrived on September 3, 1994. On September 6, 1994, McDonald called
                    me and said that I'd been “fired.” You know the technicality as well as I do.
                    You're not literally “fired,” but I had not been approved for a second LCE
                    [Limited Career Extension]. So I then knew that I was only good for a one year
                    assignment in Zambia. At this point the African Bureau nominated me for what I
                    think was called a “607 extension.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Boy, these numbers disappear fast from memory. In any event, I “won”
                    that, thanks to the Africa Bureau, so I knew that my remaining USAID career was
                    then set: two years in Zambia and then retirement. That's what happened, and it
                    worked well. The Zambian Government was so busy betraying democracy that, when I
                    left, it was clearly time to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was one of great hope that the new government, which had won a free
                    and fair election from Kenneth Kaunda, was sustaining its economic policy and
                    implementing broader, democratic reforms. The Zambian Government sustained the
                    economic reform program, but not the political pledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under Frederick Chiluba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. So, as in Tanzania, I inherited a program that I liked very much.
                    I worked with it and shaped it. One part of that puzzle was a $15 million
                    democracy portfolio. This gave us entree to all of the political “actors” in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do under that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In a nutshell, to provide funding to make it possible for “alternative
                    voices” to be heard. Not so much opposition parties, of course, but to provide
                    training to opposition parties to “level the playing field” and provide
                    technical assistance on how to run a political party and so on. Also, to provide
                    resources for NGO [Non Governmental Organization] monitoring groups and civics
                    education. This covered basic civics education, involving women's groups and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>We monitored the course of political reforms which the government had pledged
                    itself to carry out, like the privatization of the press, for instance, and
                    streamlining cabinet processes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this in cooperation with the government or
                        separately.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Some of it was in cooperation with the government and some of it was
                    not. When the government manipulated the constitution to prevent Kenneth Kaunda
                    from running, which happened in the middle of 1996, we and other aid donors
                    decided to send “signals” that we disapproved of this “backtracking” on
                    democratic processes. I helped to draft a statement which was approved by the
                    NSC [National Security Council] and which announced that we were cutting off
                    some of the project support to the Zambian Government. So that was an
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have an effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I suppose not. However, I was instrumental in convincing the aid donors
                    not to provide budget support to the Zambian Government. Budget support was all
                    cut off, and I take some credit for that achievement. In that sense all of our
                    taxpayers were better off. Project aid continues, and the aid donors, as a
                    group, watched the political situation very carefully. As you know, Kenneth
                    Kaunda was jailed on Christmas Eve of 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meantime, were the World Bank and the International
                        Monetary Fund proceeding with the economic side of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, and Chapter 7 of my book covers more than you want to know about
                    that. It's all spelled out. It was an “ugly story.” The Bank and the Fund are
                    concerned about maintaining stability and maintaining the flows of aid donor
                    funds to maintain the debt repayments on schedule. It's not a pretty
                    picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile, did we reinstate our balance of payments
                        support to Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: No, and, to the best of my knowledge, there is no balance of payments
                    support from any aid donor. I think that all of the aid donors agree that it's a
                    pretty messy situation, created by President Chiluba. Meanwhile, project aid
                    continues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects were we continuing to support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In addition to support for democracy, we had an agricultural project to
                    reform the agricultural program. We started a very major health, HIV/AIDS, and
                    family planning program. That's an exciting story. It was done carefully and
                    collegially.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what is the story?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: In the case of Zambia the story is a little like the story in Tanzania.
                    We were “late to arrive” on the block. My predecessor had been caught up in the
                    drought and the reform program and didn't have time and apparently not too much
                    interest in the health program. I am an economist by training and not a Health
                    Officer but I have always been sympathetic to that side of USAID's
                    contribution.</p>
                <p>Other people and I recruited Paul Hartenberger from the Latin American Bureau,
                    who was one of USAID's best Health Officers. With Paul in the driver's seat we
                    signed up major programs for AIDS, for family planning, and for health more
                    generally. The Zambian Government had already mounted a reform program affecting
                    all aspects of health care in Zambia. It had recruited aid donors for this
                    effort, and we were “late to the table.”</p>
                <p>So while I was in Tanzania, there were sensitivities of a somewhat different
                    kind, but, nonetheless, there was great concern that USAID, with all of its
                    “bucks,” was barging into this area of activity late, grabbing all of its
                    favorite pieces, and upsetting the apple cart with respect to all of the
                    pre-existing agreements with the Tanzanian Government and with the other aid
                    donors. In the case of Zambia, Paul and I made sure that that did not
                    happen.</p>
                <p>In fact, the other aid donors were “speechless” that we would be so genuinely
                    “collegial” and so genuinely prepared to pick up programs where there was mutual
                    agreement, without upsetting anybody.</p>
                <p>Haven, I have to tell you one of my favorite little stories in this connection. I
                    was struck by the fact that even USAID, which talks about ownership,
                    sustainability, and collegiality, often pushes projects through the Global
                    Bureau without ever asking a government official. So this particular,
                    unsolicited proposal passed through the Global Bureau, was parallel with the
                    major Zambian Government health reform program, which we were negotiating
                    separately. It was a small request, but the principle mattered. So I went to the
                    Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health and said: “We're working with you
                    on this health reform program. We have this tangential effort. I am very
                    interested in knowing what you think of it and whether we should change or
                    modify it. What do you think?” The conversation came to an end, and the
                    Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health just sat there, stony-faced. I
                    thought to myself: “Oh, boy, I really misspoke this time.” The Permanent
                    Secretary then said: “Joe, you have to give me a minute to collect my thoughts.
                    Nobody's ever asked me before for my views.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You asked him what he thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. The sad truth is that the aid donors must be awfully “pushy,” all
                    of us. It's no wonder that government officials in Africa have a hard time
                    getting on their feet and standing on their feet. This is an index of
                    development.</p>
                <p>In Indonesia you would not dream of “pushing” an Indonesian Government official.
                    Today the first line and second line officials in the ministries in Indonesia
                    have some depth to them. They are clearly in charge, and that kind of donor
                    attitude never comes up. You wouldn't dream of “cooking up” a project without
                    clearing it with the Indonesian Government. Sadly, it is a different situation
                    in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the pieces that we picked up in the population
                        area? Was there anything very specific or special?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that we handled a lot of training. We picked up decentralized
                    health systems management and monitoring. I believe that it is true that the
                    other aid donors welcomed us in those areas. They had seen USAID's strength in
                    other countries and knew that that was what we were good at.</p>
                <p>In any event, the only thing that I know for sure and that I think counts is that
                    everybody was smiling. In the case of the Ministry of Health the Deputy Minister
                    eventually became the Minister. His name was Katele Kalumba. A medical doctor
                    led the health reform process in the Zambian Government after the elections of
                    1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was truly a multi-donor approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, and it was led by the Zambian Government. So it was everything
                    that theory tells us it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. And did they have the capacity to carry out this
                        health reform program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Not initially, but, step by step, they built it. I'm sure that, behind
                    the scenes, there is still heavy dependence on the aid donors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that include an HIV/AIDS component?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. That, in turn, includes a very large, private sector component.
                    The private sector handles condom sales, advertising, and that sort of thing. It
                    also includes the Zambian private sector in health, as well as Zambian
                    traditional “healers.” I thought that this was a very nice step. Not that we
                    embrace traditional healing practices. However, these folks have rapport with
                    the local communities and obviously have to be partners in this exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you also thinking of making reforms in the field of
                        agriculture? Did I interrupt your thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes, let me finish this comment on health reform. As I was leaving
                    Zambia in October, 1996, there was some evidence from doctors and nurses that
                    the rate of Sexually Transmitted Diseases was showing some signs of coming down,
                    that the rate of HIV/AIDS increase was tapering off, and that family planning
                    was starting to be accepted. So I think that we are seeing...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was HIV/AIDS as devastating as people predicted that it
                        would be, in terms of “wiping out” a lot of middle management types?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. It's a “horror story” that one tends not to see. It's only now
                    that the evidence of funeral processions clogging the streets makes an impact.
                    In an office setting you see death notices which tell you that this or that
                    person will no longer be there. Any business that has any sort of personnel plan
                    today now has “back up” personnel in train. They just know that they have to
                    have them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also feel this in the USAID Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: You recognize the names of FSN's [Foreign Service National employees]
                    who have died. You occasionally visit them in a hospital and occasionally attend
                    their funerals. We always passed the hat to raise money for their families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about employing people? Did you have to have blood
                        tests? Or didn't you ask?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: We had an USAID “test policy” for participants in our programs. I think
                    that we had one for FSN's as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about reforms in agriculture.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's an example of possibly “getting in” too early. Within the
                    Ministry of Agriculture the whole parastatal system of state control was being
                    dismantled. However, the bureaucrats within the Ministry, the aid donors, and
                    particularly the World Bank, had no “vision” or equivalent “concept” as existed
                    for health reform. There was no Zambian official in this area, such as a Deputy
                    Minister or Minister in charge of an agricultural reform program. The
                    agricultural reform program suffered mightily for not having a “vision” of what
                    was wanted.</p>
                <p>The Ministry had the policies, because the reform program was “on track.”
                    However, that sector did not have a concept of what the new Ministry of
                    Agriculture should look like, in a market economy. As a result, most of the
                    bilateral aid donors were forever “kicking the hell” out of the World Bank, and
                    for good reason. The World Bank was primarily interested in moving money. For
                    once, the aid donors were primarily interested in “doing the right thing” to
                    sustain the liberalization program. There was controversy over this situation
                    when I was in Zambia, and there is controversy to this day. It will probably
                    take a while to sort out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What particular issues were involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, the core issue was whether the agricultural bureaucracy would be
                    retrained and reestablished as it was, as the controlling influence on seed,
                    extension, on “marginal lands,” and so forth. The alternative was a “vision”
                    that encompassed the Zambian Government working with private investors as
                    partners or working with seed companies, for example. The government could work
                    with foreign companies which were already there, growing roses, for example, or
                    allowing farmers to be free to switch away from cultivating maize [corn] and
                    into better, dry land crops. In short, all of the marketing reforms which have
                    to do with an “agreement in principle.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you bring up agricultural reform, or did you think
                        that there wasn't much chance that anything could be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: To be honest with you, this issue was very troubling for several
                    reasons. One was the lack of “vision.” Another was the fact that our officer
                    responsible for project work was a very bright but “difficult” individual. I
                    found myself supporting the “brightness” but not the “difficulty.” This was very
                    hard to do. Ultimately, I kept the officer on, though many people hated me for
                    it and still do, to this day. The new policies just warranted “toughness,” and
                    so we were at an impasse, quite frankly. We were funding a very small project in
                    which CLUSA, a well-known USAID supported firm, was trying to arrange “business
                    extension” of commercial farming, on a “pilot” basis. That was about all that we
                    were doing in this field.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We had a lot of money for this purpose, but it wasn't being spent. It is probably
                    a good thing that it wasn't being spent. The avenues just weren't open and clear
                    enough to warrant all of the “front end” costs involved.</p>
                <p>I think that the other aid donors were “schizoid” on this subject. They were
                    coming to support this kind of program but were not at all comfortable with the
                    lack of leadership and the lack of “vision.” Private investors, Zambian and
                    foreign, were working to develop Zambian agriculture, and that much was very
                    exciting. But it wasn't the kind of partnership that we wanted.</p>
                <p>I'm writing about this in my book, Chapter 6 on African agriculture. Briefly,
                    there has to be a ministerial willingness to embrace all actors. The idea that
                    the Ministry of Agriculture can do it all, know it all, and control it all is
                    just nonsense. Those days are long gone, and aid donors should not spend a dime
                    supporting any such concept. Anyway, agricultural reform is a sad story and a
                    great disappointment. If I had it to do over again, I think that I'd get a
                    different officer to handle it.</p>
                <p>The other penalty in all of this was that USAID was helping to fund “wildlife
                    management.” I was new to this field but had been active in wildlife management
                    in Tanzania. This is a story that I didn't emphasize or mention in the section
                    on Tanzania. In Zambia I inherited a program that I grew to like very much. It
                    had to do with community management of wildlife, on a sustainable basis, so that
                    resources obtained from hunting would be shared with the community. It's a long
                    and involved story, filled with contention. The idea is sound, and it is now
                    working out.</p>
                <p>It turned out that my Project Officer didn't like this program, for reasons that
                    I never understood. I was there in Zambia only two years. The question of this
                    Project Officer's extension for a second tour was out of my hands, so I didn't
                    get a chance to withhold my approval for his second tour. The concept was
                    important, and I felt that it was worth sustaining. Africa has to learn to use
                    its wildlife to best advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this project “shaped like”? What were we trying
                        to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was a “regional project” funded out of Harare [Zimbabwe] and then
                    Gaborone, with implementation and monitoring by the USAID Mission. The national
                    parks of Zambia are surrounded by Game Management Areas [GMA's]. No hunting is
                    permitted in the parks, but hunting is permitted in the Game Management Areas.
                    Within these GMA's it is in the community's interest to regard wild life within
                    them as a resource, so that they are used as a tourist attraction, both for
                    cameras and for guns. The resources obtained from “hunting licenses” are “plowed
                    back” into the country and into the communities, so that there is a personal
                    “payoff” to village chiefs, to scouts, and to the citizens. This money is used
                    for salaries, as well as for schools, bridges, clinics, and so forth. Africa
                    needs a game management system, wherein the “off-take of game” is scientifically
                    determined. And they're on the verge of doing that. Any particular Game
                    Management Area will know that there are, say, two lions and three bucks of
                    whatever species that can be “culled” per season, whatever the number is. The
                    information available on this subject is very impressive. Translating this
                    information into a working program is a challenge, all tied into satellite
                    “imagery,” game counts, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This process was just getting started while you were there
                        in Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was started about a decade or more ago. The process is slow, in the
                    face of corruption and poaching permitted by some government officials. It's
                    been a real, tough slog.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working in Zambia, compared to Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was working better in Zambia than it had worked in Tanzania. I grew
                    very fond of the Zambian people. I could easily live there again. I worked on
                    behalf of the FSN's to raise their salaries through promised State procedures. I
                    also hired Zambians and moved them into senior positions. I enjoyed that part of
                    my job in Zambia a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zambia has been characterized as a country that's been
                        dominated by its urban areas, to a large extent. In a sense, it's the most
                        urban, African country because of the copper mines and all that. It required
                        a form of social transformation to balance urban/rural relationships. Did
                        you think that that was called for? Did Zambia begin to shift to more of an
                        agricultural base and a broader, production base, rather than being
                        dependent on the urbanized centers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's interesting. I've never heard it phrased that way. It is clear
                    that Kenneth Kaunda had decided that Zambia was going to grow maize [corn], or
                    else. So the cultivation of maize was funded, lock, stock, and barrel by the
                    national budget. Maize was grown, as THE crop to feed the cities, and farmers
                    were really “civil servants.” They were protected by input prices, marketing,
                    procurement, and all the rest of it. That system is now being “liberalized” but
                    also compromised. It is being privatized. Now you put the two together, and 50
                    years from now I would guess that there would be large scale employment in
                    modern agriculture, as well as in value added from copper mining. If you're
                    willing to give me 50 years, I would be willing to bet that both sectors will be
                    dynamic.</p>
                <p>It is true that Zambia is the most urbanized of all of the African countries. The
                    “line of rail,” which is the “code word” used to describe the urban zone between
                    the copper mines and the capital, Lusaka, is where 50 percent of the population
                    lives. However, I have to tell you again that when you are in Java [Indonesia],
                    Dhaka [Bangladesh], or Calcutta [India], you have a vision of humanity that
                    leaves no doubt in your mind as to what it is to live “cheek by jowl” with other
                    people. You get to Zambia, and people say: “Well, it's 50 percent urbanized, and
                    everybody lives along the 'line of rail.' So you go to the “line of rail,” and
                    there is nobody to be seen. That visual comparison is pretty powerful stuff!</p>
                <p>But I have to balance that story with another one, though. Just to change the
                    subject for a minute, there is evidence that the increasing tensions in Africa
                    are all rooted in poverty and pressure on the land, particularly in Burundi and
                    Rwanda. Behind the “genocide” that has taken place in Rwanda, there is intense
                    pressure on land. My wife, Caroline, and I saw that for ourselves. Again, the
                    comparison goes back to Java.</p>
                <p>If you travel the length of the island of Java, you can see the pressure of that
                    immense population on that relatively small island, which is forcing the
                    cultivation of food crops higher and higher on the volcanoes. On almost all of
                    those mountains the bases are planted, and the people are moving their way up
                    the sides of these volcanoes. They may now be a third of the way up.</p>
                <p>Well, in Burundi and Rwanda, as you may know, they cultivate the tops of every
                    hill as far as the eye can see. That is the visual index of what the population
                    pressure is like. So as much as Africa may seem to be “empty,” there are parts
                    of Africa where there is very great population pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, is there anything else about Zambia that you want to
                        say at this point? You finished up your USAID career in Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I did. I left Zambia at the very beginning of October, 1996, just about
                    a year ago. We took a long-planned trip through West Africa. We spent time in
                    Abidjan [Ivory Coast] with Bill Pearson; in Bamako [Mali] with Joel and Abhaya
                    Schlesinger; in Senegal, with Anne Williams and Gary Merritt. Gary had been the
                    Family Planning Officer in Kenya who got that program going. Then we went to
                    Cape Verde and spent time with Larry and Gloria Benedict. Larry was the
                    Ambassador. He had been the Deputy Economic Officer in Dhaka [Bangladesh], at
                    the very beginning of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you compare East and West Africa, from your
                        observations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: It was much too short a visit to say. Abidjan is clearly a bustling,
                    metropolitan center, filled with foreign ethnic groups. In that sense it is more
                    sophisticated and more dynamic than, say, Nairobi [Kenya]. I would imagine that
                    it was equal to Johannesburg [South Africa] in some ways. We went to Timbuktu
                    [Mali] and got a small sample of Sahelian problems. Dakar, Senegal, is
                    culturally very rich and cosmopolitan, as well as very interesting to see. I
                    came away from this visit with a strong sense that the agricultural systems are
                    essentially “dormant.” Nobody is really touching the potential of these
                    countries. There is very little regional cooperation of any kind. The French
                    have been quite a “curse” on these countries. Some day these countries will all
                    break free. I spent entirely too much of my time seeing friends. We spent most
                    of the time, sitting in the kitchen, talking about old times, rather than being
                    out and about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired from Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I had written ahead and had applied for grants in order to write. I
                    didn't win any grants. However, I had written to IFPRI [International Food
                    Policy Research Institute], and “out of the blue” they said: “By all means, you
                    are welcome to the use of an office.” So I've had two academic years at IFPRI,
                    writing furiously. I've taken on far more time than I ever imagined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have you been writing about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I have a draft book composed of 10 chapters. The chapters are ordered
                    by subject matter and not chronologically or in terms of my autobiographical
                    experience in AID. I find that I can use an awful lot of the stories that have
                    developmental impact to fill in the narrative and make it more credible. I'm
                    trying to write as a “generalist” for a broad, American audience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I will be happy to tell you. The first chapter is all introduction,
                    setting out my purpose. The second chapter is about USAID in Washington and what
                    that means both for our flexibility and the constraints under which we operate.
                    The third chapter is a review of developmental theory and practice since the
                    Marshall Plan [1948-1958 in Europe]. The fourth chapter is about the Bangladeshi
                    agricultural story of the 1970's, written with the advantage of hindsight. The
                    fifth chapter is about life “in the field,” our presence, so to speak, and what
                    it means to live and work overseas, instead of in Washington. The sixth chapter
                    is about African agriculture and why it is so profoundly important for the
                    future of Africa. Chapters seven and eight are about structural adjustment and
                    democracy, mainly on the basis of what I had observed in Zambia. However, I
                    believe that both chapters provide a generic story about the problems facing
                    African structural adjustment and democracy. I find that, in most cases, the
                    problems lie more with the aid donors than with the Africans. I have some pretty
                    hard things to say about what donors do and don't do. The ninth chapter is about
                    American training and advisory services for many parts of the world. They were a
                    heroic success for Asia but a tragedy for Africa. Chapter 10 is about everything
                    that I left out in previous chapters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. That's quite an undertaking. It's a very interesting
                        concept. Obviously, we'll have to wait for the book. Let's take a few
                        minutes, if you have the time, to talk about your more general views on aid,
                        development, and so on. Is there any way of characterizing, from all of your
                        experience, what you think works and what doesn't work in the “development
                        business”? That's a big question, but could you talk about your approach to
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I felt, as I left Tanzania and Zambia, that USAID as an institution
                    knows a great deal about development practice and administration. In the best of
                    all possible worlds, in which USAID as an institution might have a greater
                    degree of freedom than we have had, we could have done more but we still have a
                    lot to offer to the poorer world. It's very sad that that capacity seems to be
                    in the course of being dismantled, to some degree, if not totally. Even some
                    close friends of mine say: “Joe, wake up to the fact that AID is dead, and that
                    era is over.” I think that the American people, even those who live outside the
                    Beltway [i.e., outside of Washington, DC] don't know the AID story because we
                    were necessarily caught up in the Cold War, in micromanagement, in “earmarking”
                    funds, and in serving other, foreign policy priorities. This is all
                    understandable. It's just unfortunate.</p>
                <p>I feel that my own career in AID was a great privilege. I would do it again in a
                    minute. I have very few regrets. I'm very proud of the fact that our country has
                    this kind of agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize USAID as an institution in the
                        world development business, compared to other donors or sources of
                        assistance? Is there anything particularly distinctive about USAID? You've
                        hinted at some aspects.</hi>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that U.S. foreign aid, since the days of the Lend-Lease program
                    [during World War II], the Marshall Plan, and the “Point Four” program
                    [technical assistance to the underdeveloped world] has stood out as an
                    innovator, and we still stand out. We are still respected and looked to. When we
                    are not able to measure up to our own standards, our absence is noted, and this
                    is being noted by other aid donors today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are some of the areas where USAID is particularly
                        distinguished for the innovations which it has introduced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: First off is the fact that AID people overseas are respected for their
                    “open door” attitude, for candor, and for friendliness and constructiveness. We
                    represent American culture overseas, in the largest sense. We have had a degree
                    of authority that other, bilateral programs don't have. We don't always have the
                    best officers in a given place and at the right time. However, more often than
                    not, we handle our “portfolio” very well, not only in the project sense but in
                    the sectoral and macro sense.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding problems back here in Washington with certain personalities,
                    AID's health record overseas is a fine one. I learned early on in my career that
                    if I invited in a team of health people, I didn't have to worry about its
                    quality at all. By that I mean that the health team would probably have visited
                    the country previously, would have been students and teachers of local
                    counterparts, would have known the “story,” and would have known how to work in
                    a collegial sense.</p>
                <p>I could not say that about AID agricultural projects. In my personal experience
                    and for whatever reasons, AID's ability to build a constituency behind our
                    agricultural portfolio never worked very well. In retrospect, I know just by
                    observation that something was working very well during the days of the “Green
                    Revolution” when we cooperated with the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and
                    with American universities and agricultural schools. However, for whatever
                    reason this record didn't continue in later years. Not in Africa, anyway. Also,
                    the work that I did in Bangladesh came from me. It did not come from the
                    American agricultural tradition. It could have, perhaps, and should have, but it
                    didn't. The pressures which I faced originated with the USDA [U.S. Department of
                    Agriculture]. At the time I had few, if any, allies in this connection. Or maybe
                    I just met the wrong people. I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other sectors, other areas in which you were
                        involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that, despite all of the biases in AID legislation, my
                    impression is that our PDO's [Project Development Officers] do a good job of
                    developing tangible programs. The locomotive procurement and road construction
                    situation in Tanzania were handled, not only with great skill, but with wisdom.
                    We did some very fine things.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Program aid in general, though, is a mixed story. There were too many motives and
                    too many undefined objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your experience did you find that U.S. political and
                        security interests supported or conflicted with the development objectives
                        that you were trying to pursue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: As I say in my book, I had the good fortune to serve in countries that
                    were not strategically important to the United States. This was only
                    accidentally the case, but I think that it let my predecessors, and then, later,
                    me, focus on development more than we might have been able to do in other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then why were we in these countries, if they weren't
                        particularly important to the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: They were important because of the AID legislative commitment. First
                    and foremost, this commitment is to poor people in a poor environment. So when
                    we are able to focus our energies, in the way that we have been directed to do,
                    we focus on poor countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you consider that in U.S. foreign policy interests
                        there is a genuine priority for development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Yes. I would say that it is “genuine.” I would not say that it is
                    always a “high priority.” Again, Haven, I've been lucky in the very few
                    instances when I have had differences with an Ambassador about a U.S. foreign
                    policy interest, versus a developmental interest. I think that in almost all
                    such cases the Ambassador decided in favor of the developmental interest. That
                    was very gratifying to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working in USAID as an organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, I joined USAID in 1972, when people said that morale had never
                    been lower. For the following 25 years people said much the same thing. I think
                    that a lot of us learned to complain that morale was low. However, the truth of
                    the matter is that we all “carried on.” Most of us with great spirit, cheer, and
                    enthusiasm. This was partly because we were overseas, but not entirely so. Even
                    today I guess that most of the people here in this blessed new building are
                    working hard. They like what they are doing and prefer to be there, rather than
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the foreign assistance program has made
                        a difference in world development conditions about which we hear so much? We
                        hear what's wrong with the world, the crises, and so forth. Some people
                        would say: “Well, what have you done with all of that money for all of these
                        years if we have all of these crises?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: That's the lowest of low “cheap shots.” The truth of the matter is that
                    most of that money has gone to serve U.S. Government priorities which are not
                    about development. If you take away that portion...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, whatever country during whatever era you want: Central America,
                    the peace accords between Egypt and Israel, base rights in Turkey, and on and
                    on. Fishing in the South Pacific, Ireland, you name it. If you grant anybody the
                    luxury of stripping all of that away, I think that AID has contributed very
                    impressively to development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would you think that USAID made the greatest
                        impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think that one of our greatest impacts was probably one of our
                    earliest. That was American technical assistance to Taiwan and South Korea. We
                    were the one assistance donor. They were in charge. We weren't “playing games.”
                    We were technical, not political. The policy was already decided. They were
                    determined to develop their economies with our help. They wanted our help. They
                    wanted us there. We wanted to leave at a fixed time. They wanted us to leave at
                    a fixed time. Furthermore, both Taiwan and South Korea said “No” to food aid,
                    early in their development period.</p>
                <p>Successes in other countries come down mostly to training. Training in Indonesia
                    and Turkey. Training and agricultural assistance in India. There were a lot of
                    family planning successes, not just bilateral but involving the UN family of
                    agencies. I don't know that anybody has looked at this, Haven, but it would be
                    fascinating to figure out what the intellectual contribution of AID has been to
                    WHO [World Health Organization] and the intellectual contribution of AID and the
                    USDA, bless them, to the FAO [Food and Agricultural Organization] and to the
                    World Food Program. It would be hard to sort that out, but there may be
                    something there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that you can pick out certain development themes,
                        which were the pioneering efforts, and how the HIV/AIDS program evolved with
                        USAID assistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>STEPANEK: There are some instances where we might want to take some credit and
                    some where we don't deserve to take credit. That is in the case of East Asian
                    and Southeast Asian adherence to market principles. This was probably very much
                    of their own doing. Indirectly, we probably contributed through providing
                    training, but not so much through other avenues. There have been no World
                    Bank/IDA loans to Malaysia or Taiwan. There were no cases of a dozen aid donors
                    arguing over “second order priorities.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But do many of these countries continue to seek a
                        technical or economic relationship with the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I think so. I think that there will continue to be a demand for our
                    services, if we have the freedom to divide up our portfolio in a different way.
                    In this connection I think of questions of good governance, taxation,
                    expenditure controls, democracy, pluralism, and other, specialized subjects. We
                    could play the role of an IESC [International Executive Service Corps], doing
                    some of these activities for a fee. I envisage AID being a “window” through
                    which the poor and developing countries have access to the U.S. economy and the
                    U.S. Government. We could provide some of these services ourselves but basically
                    we would function as a “hiring hall” and referral service. We know how to
                    “package” services. We know how to test demand. We know how to “target.” We
                    could do that with a very few field missions. There may be no demand for such
                    services. The last thing we should do is to go looking for business. That is,
                    looking for business a second, third, and fourth time in a given country. We
                    would obviously want to offer our services on the World Wide Web and be in touch
                    with likely candidates. However, we should not be in the position of “pushing”
                    our services.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: I would say: “Grab the opportunity!</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: If you have more questions, I'd be happy to try to answer them. Sure,
                    in terms of the highlights of my career, we've covered a lot of ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>My book says a lot, but it doesn't say everything. Regrettably, I don't have the
                    time or the knowledge to look at AID management under present circumstances. I
                    think that it's important, Haven, because this “re-engineering business” cuts
                    across the whole federal government. I also think that much of it is profoundly
                    wrong headed. This subject deserves attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is it profoundly wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Because it treats professional civil servants as automatons or drones,
                    both in terms of respect, experience and with regard to technology. You're
                    supposed to sit in front of screens and push buttons. I don't believe that
                    that's what the American people want. I don't think that it's what the federal
                    government must offer to a very sophisticated, American economy. The idea that
                    we can be pushed into little boxes and face video screens all day strikes me as
                    foolish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then that's your way of understanding this process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: However, I'm not trying to be all-encompassing. This is one aspect of
                    what I see. To be fair, I know that there's more to it than that. Some of it's
                    good, but I think that the negative side of this has hit USDA [U.S. Department
                    of Agriculture] hard and the Economic Research Service hard. It has certainly
                    hit AID and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] hard. I think that it's
                    hitting other federal agencies and I think it's an idea which was “still born”
                    at the beginning. It's been pushed by Vice President Al Gore and others. I don't
                    think that it's taken us very far. To see Carol Peasley, for example, in an
                    office that is one-third the size that an AA [Administrative Assistant] should
                    have is contemptible, I think. I don't see putting AA's in boxes.</p>
                <p>This goes back to the baggage which, I think, we all carry. This is much more a
                    personal comment than something for the record, but I don't mind putting it on
                    the record. You join the federal service and you carry this image that you're a
                    public servant. Many people outside the federal government service consider that
                    you're “on the dole,” and your job is simple. The view is that the private
                    sector is where the real challenge is. This couldn't be further from the
                    truth.</p>
                <p>Senior public servants have remarkably complex jobs. Nowhere in the private
                    sector, except maybe at the topmost level, do you have people working under such
                    complex conditions and such pressure. Private sector jobs are not nearly as
                    complex and demanding as government jobs. I'm very proud of what I've
                    learned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEPANEK: Well, maybe I'm just being “provincial,” but I think that it's more
                    complex, because we are all “multi-cultural.” That's a new factor. And not by
                    comparison with the governments of poor countries and their citizens but
                    Embassies, which have different agendas built right in, cheek by jowl. So you
                    have tensions that other kinds of corporate forms don't have to the same degree.
                    I suppose that the Bureau of Indian Affairs [in the Department of the Interior]
                    would say: “Well, we've got to deal with Indians and with state governors, and
                    there are tensions there.” That's understandable.</p>
