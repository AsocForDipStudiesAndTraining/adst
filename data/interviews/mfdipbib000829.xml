                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Morad began his career with USIA in May 1960 as a
                        Junior Officer Trainee. During the next 33 years as a Foreign Service
                        Officer he served in various capacities in Latin America, Europe, and
                        Washington. His overseas assignments included Assistant Cultural Officer in
                        Rio de Janeiro and Branch Public Affairs Officer in Fortaleza, Brazil;
                        Information Officer in El Salvador and later in Madrid, Spain; Public
                        Affairs Officer in Brussels; and Deputy PAO in Paris. His varied Washington
                        assignments included Policy Officer for Latin America; Deputy Director of
                        the Office of European Affairs; and Chief of the European Division of the
                        Voice of America. In addition, he had two assignments with the Department of
                        State, first as Public Affairs Advisor to the U.S. Mission to the OAS, and
                        then as Public Affairs Advisor to the American Republics Bureau of the State
                        Department. He retired in 1993 as a Minister-Counselor of the Senior Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I planned to become a foreign correspondent; in fact, I studied journalism
                    as an undergraduate, and one of my fellow students at the University of Southern
                    California was Pete Synodis; Pete had become aware of USIA and was interested in
                    joining it himself. He was a year ahead of me in school. He did join the Agency
                    and inspired me to come along about a year and a half later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were doing your undergraduate work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Well, he made me aware of it while he was going through the process of
                    recruitment and getting hired. On my graduation, I went to graduate school at
                    the Columbia University School of Journalism, and while I was there, the Agency
                    sent a recruiter to talk to members of the graduating class, including myself. I
                    completed an application and sent it in. On graduation from Columbia, I returned
                    home to Los Angeles and went to work for United Press International. I pretty
                    much had given up hope that I was going to be accepted, and then suddenly a
                    letter arrived inviting me to come to Washington for language tests, entrance
                    exams and interviews, which I did, and some months after that I was actually
                    hired.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: That was in May of 1960.</p>
                <p>JR. OFFICER TRAININGASSIGNED TO MADRID</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went into the Junior Officer Trainee class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I went in as a Junior Officer Trainee, yes, and at that time, the training
                    program was only three months long in Washington. The Foreign Service in my mind
                    was completely associated with France. Being a diplomat to me was being a
                    diplomat in France, and I fully expected to be assigned to Paris. When I wasn't,
                    I was deeply disappointed. It seems ludicrous today, but I was very disappointed
                    with my assignment as a Junior Officer Trainee to Spain, which to me at the time
                    was the end of the world, which was a reflection of my faulty or limited world
                    view and of what Spain represented in history and, of what a magnificent and
                    wonderfulcountry it was. Of course, everybody told me that at the time I
                    received my assignment. I was the object of a lot of envy, but I didn't envy
                    myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any foreign language competence at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I had studied Spanish and having lived in Los Angeles, I was exposed to
                    some Spanish, but I wasn't really fluent. Then I studied French for two years in
                    college and I tested at, I think, a 1-plus level in French, as part of my
                    entrance exam. So on my arrival in Spain, I actually did not really speak
                    Spanish at all. I had no Washington Language Training, only on-the-job training
                    in the Embassy and just picked it up through those daily hourly classes and
                    osmosis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Junior Officer Trainee class were you in, do you
                        remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: No, I don't remember. It was interesting because it was a class that was
                    sandwiched in between two classes that had been previously scheduled. It was
                    kind of an impromptu class and was relatively small. I think there were only 8
                    or 9 of us in the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Madrid was where you got both good news and bad news
                        because I was there at the same time you were, as you recall. The good news
                        was that you met your future wife there, and I guess the bad news was that
                        you became ill during the course of your tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MORAD: That's right. Both were in some ways related to each other. The fact is
                    that I came down with hepatitis, which was not diagnosed properly by, I should
                    not say a Spanish, but an Austrian doctor who practiced in Spain. Literally one
                    day I could not get out of bed. I mean my body was so weak that I decided to go
                    out to Torrejon Air Base for an examination. I had resisted up till that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a joint American-Spanish Air Base.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: That was the joint American-Spanish Air Base, which had a modern American
                    hospital and medical facilities. I resisted going there primarily out of
                    ignorance, but also because it was inconvenient. I was admitted to Torrejon Air
                    Base Hospital for treatment. I have to go back a bit. First, I spent a couple of
                    weeks at the Anglo- American Hospital in Madrid and then was released, and it
                    was during that period that I met my wife. It was through a mutual friend. She
                    had come to Madrid to study art at the San Fernando Academy. During the period
                    of my recovery from hepatitis after my release from the Anglo-American Hospital
                    I met my wife and we dated and went out quite a lot. As you would expect from
                    two relatively young people in Madrid, we had a great time. I did not properly
                    take care of myself and I had a relapse. It was because of this relapse I ended
                    up in the Torrejon Air Base hospital for over 6 weeks. I couldn't even
                    officially call her my girlfriend; she was somebody I had just met recently and
                    we dated but she came out to the hospital 15 miles from Madrid every day to
                    visit me. It was very inconvenient for her because she had to take public
                    transportation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really impressed you!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Every day, in fact, every day for six weeks. She kept me from going crazy
                    in that hospital. We spent a lot of time playing gin rummy, in which she won a
                    lot of money from me. But it was because of that experience that we established
                    our relationship. Then my assignment was extended in Spain for further recovery.
                    I had received an assignment to Bolivia as Assistant Information Officer, but
                    because of the illness, the assignment was canceled and I was extended in
                    Madrid. Six months later, I returned to the United States on leave without pay
                    for an extended period of time for further recovery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My! Leave without pay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: What had happened was that since the illness came shortly after joining
                    the Agency, I had no accumulated sick leave, so I had to borrow the maximum two
                    years advance sick leave. I used all that up and then went on leave without pay
                    and spent three months at home in Los Angeles; then I returned to Washington on
                    detail for another three months before being assigned to Rio.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into that, how many months were you training
                        before you got ill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Actually, I completed the formal training program, and the illness kind of
                    coincidentally took place at the end of my training program in Madrid. So, what
                    it resulted in was an extension of my assignment there, and during that period I
                    was assigned as Assistant Cultural Officer, mainly in charge of the library,
                    distribution of materials and a variety of things connected to the cultural
                    section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the training in general? Was it worthwhile, or was
                        it not so good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It was hard to call it training, per se. It was kind of an accumulation of
                    experience. I mean, you are there, you are assigned your task, you perform those
                    tasks and in the process you learn the job. It wasn't training in the sense that
                    somebody was standing over you saying something should be done this way, or that
                    way. It was essentially work experience. You were gaining experience at it, and
                    your supervisors were expected to take into consideration that you were a
                    trainee and give you a wide array of tasks. In their evaluation of your
                    performance, they also took into account that you were a trainee and not
                    experienced on the job.</p>
                <p>STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICER—BRAZIL</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your leave without pay for three months or so, you
                        recovered completely and then went on assignment as Student Affairs Officer
                        to Rio? Was this based on Robert Kennedy's emphasis on Youth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes it was. I was the first Student Affairs Officer in Rio. I was among
                    the initial group of Student Affairs Officers assigned at the beginning of the
                    Kennedy administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that emphasis was warranted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Well, I didn't at the time. In fact, I resisted the assignment. I was not
                    interested in student affairs. I was not a student activist as an undergraduate.
                    I considered myself a journalist. Journalism, press and communications were my
                    interests, and my main motivation for joining the Agency. The combination of my
                    interest in foreign affairs plus my journalism and communications abilities were
                    what motivated me to join USIA. Then suddenly I was assigned to what was
                    essentially a job that was part of the cultural section and related to student
                    politics, which never particularly interested me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any guidepost as to what you were supposed to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: No guideposts whatsoever. One of the interesting things again, is, as a
                    young officer, I resisted the assignment as much as I could and finally I was
                    told by Personnel that I either had to accept the assignment or resign. So, I
                    wasn't given a choice. I think in today's Agency, there is much more flexibility
                    in the assignment process. Officers are given more choice of positions and where
                    they are assigned. In my case, there was no sympathy whatsoever for my
                    background and my interest in the press work. So, in the end I accepted the
                    assignment to Rio de Janeiro, which, as it turned out was paradise and quickly
                    overcame my resistance to the assignment. There was a huge influx of official
                    Americans in Rio at the time, primarily AID employees and AID contract
                    employees, who were being brought into the country to accelerate our economic
                    development projects in Brazil. There was a strong fear that at the time Brazil
                    was on the verge of being dominated by the Communist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Rio was the capital at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Rio was the capital of Brazil at the time. This was before the move to
                    Brasilia and when many of the leading institutions in the country, the National
                    Assembly, key labor unions, the Peasant Leagues, student unions, etc., were all
                    under the influence or domination of the Communist Party. Because of the
                    perceived threat and its size, Brazil, was a priority Third World country at the
                    time, and the United States was pouring resources into it. The Foreign Service
                    Institute even transferred the Portuguese language classes from Washington to
                    Rio, and everybody assigned there at the time was taught Portuguese. As a
                    result, my first three months in Rio were in language training. Picture this: I
                    was still a bachelor, and my temporary quarters were an ocean front hotel on
                    Copacabana beach. Portuguese classes would end at three in the afternoon, and by
                    3:30 I was on the beach, studying Portuguese while basking in the sun in one of
                    the world's great resort cities. It was a wonderful experience.</p>

                <p>MORAD: After language training, I started work as Student Affairs Officer. There
                    was no job description and there was fundamentally no interest in USIS Rio in
                    the job. Nobody really knew what it consisted of, what I should be doing, what
                    its purpose was. So I was given free hand to do whatever I felt needed to be
                    done. The National Student Union was essentially a communist-run organization at
                    the time. So I decided that my job would be to rescue the Student Union from the
                    hands of the communists; rather than pursuing the job in a cultural context, I
                    pursued it in a wholly political way. In a sense, a Cold War warrior political
                    way. As I gained experience, my contacts developed with students, student
                    leaders including the communist leaders of the Student Union and they became
                    rather close friends of mine; in fact, my daily “modus operandi” was to drift
                    further and further away from USIS and more and more toward the CIA station,
                    which was already active in its own way in that field. Essentially I became a
                    surrogate CIA officer and worked very closely with the station in international
                    student organizations, trying to prop up democratic students against the leftist
                    rabble rousers and, in student elections, helping democratic students issue
                    proclamations and giving them resources to mimeograph statements and that kind
                    of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I did that for 2 years</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these were what years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: This was 1962 to 1964. Coincidentally, the job turned out to be a lot more
                    interesting and challenging and demanding than I expected. It also turned out to
                    be a lot more relevant because, increasingly, the Student National Union was
                    seen as a major player in the national political scene because of its domination
                    by the communists. In fact, there were four pillars of the Communist Party in
                    Brazil at the time: fellow travelers in the left leaning National Assembly, the
                    Peasant Leagues, the labor unions and the National Student Union. In the
                    process, I gained a lot more attention and notoriety and was given more
                    importance than a junior officer normally would receive in a huge operation like
                    USIS Brazil, which had over 65 Americans and 250 Brazilian employees at the
                    time. So it worked to my career advantage, and led to my becoming a prot�g� of
                    sorts of the Deputy PAO, Hoyt Ware..I don't know if you remember him...</p>

                <p>MORAD: He was an old salt of a newsman; he used to be a correspondent for
                    Associated Press. In fact, he headed the Associated Press Bureau in Buenos Aires
                    at one time. He was the Deputy PAO, and, for reasons that were never clear to
                    me, he was very unhappy with the USIS Rio Press Office. Both the Information
                    Officer and the deputy IO, were highly professional, highly experienced newsmen
                    themselves; for some reason, Hoyt was always critical of them. Because he had no
                    confidence in them, he used to feed me a lot of press work in addition to my
                    regular job, including writing articles for Jornal do Brasil, the leading
                    newspaper in Rio. These articles he got placed into Jornal because of his
                    friendship with the publisher of the newspaper. Rather than assign them to the
                    Press Officer, he would give them to me, and I became a kind of ghost writer for
                    him. As a result of that collaboration I developed a close relationship with the
                    Deputy PAO. Then we had an opening for a Branch PAO in Fortaleza when USIS had a
                    branch post there. Hoyt offered me the job, which, for me at the time, was a
                    real advancement since Brazil was only my first assignment following my Junior
                    Officer Trainee tour. I accepted enthusiastically and went to Fortaleza which
                    was in northeast Brazil. At the time it was seen as the real focal point of
                    communist insurrection in Brazil. If the communists were ever going to get a
                    foothold in the country and there was going to be rural and guerrilla warfare,
                    it was expected to start in the northeast.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The Communists organized the Peasant Leagues and dominated them. On
                    occasion they were involved in armed confrontations with the military and police
                    and were seen to be only the beginning of what was going to be a larger
                    insurrection at some future time. So a lot of AID resources were going into the
                    northeast, and even though Fortaleza was close to the end of the world. In that
                    context at that particular time the region was given more importance than it
                    normally deserved. A few years later, the post was closed after the military
                    took over. Actually the military coup in Brazil took place the day after I
                    arrived in Fortaleza. With the arrival of the military, the communist threat
                    literally disappeared overnight. All the communist student leaders, labor
                    unions, labor leaders, Peasant League leaders and fellow travelers in the
                    National Assembly either fled or disappeared. There wasn't much violence. The
                    coup took place very quickly, and it taught me a lesson in terms of where the
                    real power of a country lies. The labor unions and student leaders can make a
                    lot of noise and seem to be disruptive but when the military decides to move,
                    basically there is very little anybody can do, at least in the short run, to
                    resist it. In the long run, of course, opposing forces can undermine the
                    military but in the Brazilian situation, the military remained in power for 20
                    years.</p>

                <p>MORAD: I was in Fortaleza for a year and a half and then my assignment to Brazil

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: El Salvador at the time seemed to be at the take off stage and a lot of
                    American and Japanese investment was going into the country. A lot of joint
                    ventures emerged. Exxon had just made El Salvador its Central American and
                    Caribbean headquarters as well. So there was a lot of economic activity. AID was
                    heavily involved, primarily in building schools throughout the country. One of
                    my principal jobs as Information Officer was to promote the AID program and make
                    people aware of what AID was doing in El Salvador. One of our most common
                    activities was inaugurating little red school houses in the countryside with the
                    ambassador. My job was to get press and television coverage of those events,
                    which we did. Also, at that time, placement of news articles in the local press
                    was still an important USIS activity. We managed to produce literally hundreds
                    and hundreds of column inches in the local Salvadoran press every month.</p>

                <p>MORAD: We had a very receptive press, and our placement totals were still valued
                    and appreciated in Washington. We used to get a lot of kudos for all this press
                    coverage. One can debate the value of it all today, but at that time, it seemed
                    to be valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any inkling at that time of what would happen

                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MORAD: Throughout my three years in El Salvador, everything was positive. The
                    only exception to that was the university, where there were a lot of Castro
                    sympathizers, including the dean of the university, and occasional student
                    unrest and a lot of student hostility toward the United States. We had a Student
                    Affairs Grantee at the post, Ernie Uribe, who has gone on to become a Senior
                    Officer. He was the first student affairs grantee and as a Mexican American, he
                    spoke fluent Spanish, so he made a lot of personal inroads on the campus, but
                    things got so bad there that he was no longer allowed to go on the campus
                    itself. That was a fairly restricted situation and didn't really reflect society
                    as a whole. Everybody used to look at the university and say: “That is just the
                    young kids at the university. They will get over it, and some day they will
                    become capitalist just like their parents.” So no one really took them all that
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the story of Latin America isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: That was very common thinking in Latin America at the time and with some
                    justification. Apart from student unrest, the country was booming. It had two
                    democratic elections for president while I was there; both were highly
                    monitored, including by me, and they were, at least at the precinct level,
                    honest elections. Behind the scenes there was more manipulation than we were
                    willing to admit. About 6 months after I left, the situation deteriorated badly.
                    The war with Honduras flared. This was called the “Soccer War,” which was
                    actually a misnomer because it began in the aftermath to a Salvadoran/Honduran
                    soccer game during which there were riots. But the war was really unrelated to
                    the game. More accurately it should have been called, “The First Population
                    Explosion War of the 20th Century.” It was a war that really took place because
                    pressures had developed on the Salvadoran/Honduran border. Salvador is a densely
                    populated country with a small territory. Honduras has a larger territory, is
                    under populated, and its borders are not policed very much. So, over the years,
                    20, 30, 40 years—Salvadorans had migrated illegally into Honduras, established
                    themselves there, built farms and raised their children there; but they never
                    officially became Hondurans, in fact they were never officially recognized. Then
                    the government at the time decided to crack down on all these people and started
                    putting pressure on them to return to El Salvador which had never been home to
                    many of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Honduran Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, the Honduran Government. The military government in Honduras started
                    putting pressure on them to leave, to pack up their bags and return home and
                    that created a conflict with the Salvadoran Government, which was a democratic,
                    civilian government, fundamentally backed by the military. So you really had two
                    military governments in conflict and that is what triggered the war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It ended being more serious than people realize. There were many bombings;
                    there were planes flying over El Salvador dropping bombs and vice versa for a
                    while. It was very serious! It ended in a negotiated settlement which allowed
                    the Salvadorans to stay in Honduras.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The OAS probably got involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The OAS was involved, that is right. I don't remember all the details. I
                    was no longer involved, but essentially it was a peaceful settlement that held
                    together, but the conflict itself began the downward spiral of El Salvador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at a great time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Subsequently, what happened was that Salvador had its own civil war a few
                    years later, and that was a ten year war that became a conflict of international
                    proportions and involved the United States, and became a major political issue
                    in the United States itself. Americans for the most part had never heard of El
                    Salvador while I was there, and then it became a front burner country for many
                    years. But what that civil war proved to me was in a sense prove the dictum that
                    I had once heard to never trust the use of an expert because the expert model at
                    that time was that internal insurrection urban guerrilla warfare rural guerrilla
                    warfare such as you had in Guatemala and Uruguay, for example, was not possible
                    in El Salvador because the country was too small, the population was too dense,
                    and there were no safe havens for the rebels, but the military would hunt them
                    down quickly and obliterate them. Of course that turned out to be not true at
                    all. One spot in El Salvador where there was a basically unpopulated area near
                    the Honduran border is where it became a platform for the guerilla insurrection
                    and they were able to expand from there into adjoining towns and cities until
                    they basically dominated a large part of what was the southwestern half of
                    Salvador and again the military engaged them into the next decade. The experts
                    were definitely wrong in that case as they often are.</p>

                <p>MORAD: The Agency had a mid-career training program. I was kind of early
                    mid-career at that point. Basically it was offered to me by the Agency and I
                    jumped at the opportunity.</p>

                <p>MORAD: It was September of 1968 to June 1969. I studied Latin American Affairs
                    and International Communications. I was not working for a degree. These were
                    just classes that I took to expand my knowledge of two areas that I was
                    specializing in. I found it very useful course even though I had already spent a
                    lot of time in Latin American affairs. The opportunity to study it
                    systematically made a big difference. It is one thing to absorb knowledge in a
                    haphazard scattered-experience way; it is another thing to learn it in a
                    systematic manner. It takes on more meaning for you and helps you to look at a
                    subject in a more analytical way. So, it had that value for me and it helped in
                    my immediate assignment after that, which was a Publications Officer for Latin
                    America. Much of what I picked up at North Carolina became immediately
                    applicable in my production of pamphlets, comic books, and various kinds of
                    written materials for Latin America. I was able to use that background
                    knowledge.</p>

                <p>MORAD: In fact, we printed cartoon books by the thousands. It was at a time when
                    people were beginning to doubt the utility and the relevance of comic books in
                    Agency programs, but we remained committed to them nevertheless, and I guess
                    during the two years I was in that job, I must have produced a half dozen or
                    more comic books. Producing a comic book is somewhat like producing a movie.
                    With a movie you have to go through the same development stages. We contracted
                    with an agency in New York that actually produced them. What we did was develop
                    the idea and meet with the artist and story people. Then it was their job to
                    develop a story board and sketches and so forth. While they did the actual
                    creative work, they would come to Washington every few weeks for consultations
                    with us during the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the themes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The themes were The Alliance for Progress, Youth and Democracy, the most
                    lavish one we did was a revision of an older agency comic book about the history
                    of the United States. It was beautifully done on higher quality paper than
                    usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was the audience for these comic books?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MORAD: We never knew exactly who the audience was. The audience basically was
                    young people, very young people and a less educated adult class in Latin
                    America, which of course we were still appealing to in our Agency programs. We
                    had not reached the stage where we had a DRS audience (Distribution and Record
                    System audience) of primary and secondary targets, and had not yet systematized
                    or created a scientific process for reaching our audiences. At that time, it was
                    still the more the merrier. We reached the elite audiences with programs and
                    materials that were appropriate for them, but we did not ignore the mass
                    audiences and young people as well, and that is who these were essentially
                    targeted for. On the other hand, comic books have a long and glorious history in
                    Latin America. Even to this day, adults read comic books. They are somewhat like
                    soap operas on television. You often got a much larger audience among adults
                    than you necessarily were shooting for with these things, but we were never very
                    precise in those days about who our targets were. We essentially produced the
                    materials because that was our job and we were interested in the theme. The
                    theme was what was principally important to us then. We would fund the
                    appropriate vehicle for that theme, and then we would produce it and worried
                    less about identifying the audience. That changed, of course, over the
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a fascinating experiment as always. The whole
                        history of Agency programs, wouldn't you say, is that we had to learn by
                        experimentation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: In those days we still had mobile unit programs where we would take motion
                    pictures out to the countryside, little towns and villages and show all of these
                    illiterate farm hands and village dwellers movies about the United States. I
                    still can't say with certainty that was not as valuable a thing to do as what we
                    came to do later on. In some ways, as a job, it was more rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were in that job for two years, and then you got
                        another Washington assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: At that time I was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public Affairs Advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUBLIC AFFAIRS ADVISOR TO OAS</p>
                <p>MORAD: The Latin American Area Office created an experimental position, Public
                    Affairs Advisor to the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the United States Mission to the Organization of
                        American States. You were the first one in that position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I think that I was the only one. Not officially. Up to that time, the job
                    was handled basically between the PAO office of the Bureau of American Republics
                    Affairs of the State Department. The Public Affairs Advisor in the bureau also
                    handled the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now we have a USIA officer for the first time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The idea for that, as I recall, came from Bob Amerson, who was the Area
                    Director for Latin America at the time, but it might have originated with John
                    Hova, the United States Representative to the OAS. Anyway, between the two of
                    them, they saw the need for the PAO exclusively to the mission and Bob Amerson
                    asked me if I was interested in doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he knew of you from your work in El Salvador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>More on EL SALVADOR—LBJ's VISIT</p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, Bob as Area Director came to El Salvador a number of times. El
                    Salvador was the host of the Central American Chiefs of State Summit in El
                    Salvador while I was there and Lyndon Johnson came there to attend it when he
                    was president; that attracted a lot of attention to a normally obscure post
                    because the President of the United States was there for four days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was the PAO, going back to El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: We had two. The first one was Jack McDermott, who only had a year to live
                    when I arrived. He had a very advanced case of emphysema. He could hardly
                    breathe or talk at the time I was there. It was a very frustrating experience.
                    It was tragic seeing him deteriorate in front of our eyes, but it was also
                    frustrating because he was so ill. He wouldn't give up the reins and wouldn't
                    allow the operation to go beyond his capability to run it. So, we had some
                    younger officers there like me who were basically energetic and could do very
                    little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Biting at the bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MORAD: Biting at the bit. He also had this irrational hostility toward the Peace
                    Corps, which was very big in El Salvador at the time, and was a major user of
                    our films. Volunteers were working in the countryside and used to borrow our
                    projectors and films to show to their clients. We had a very close relationship
                    with them. But one day Jack decreed that we would no longer cooperate with Peace
                    Corps volunteers. We could not give them any more materials. Of course it was a
                    totally irrational thing to do. He had this thing in his mind that the Peace
                    Corps should not have been created, that the money that was used to finance the
                    Peace Corps should have been used to finance and expand USIA activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Took it out on the poor volunteers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: That was a sign of his illness and deterioration, but it was a frustrating
                    experience to work for him. Then he was replaced by Gene Friedmann. This was
                    Gene's first assignment as a Public Affairs Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he had been a former Junior Officer Trainee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: He had been a former Junior Officer Trainee and had worked in television.
                    Gene completely turned the post around. He transformed it into a dynamic
                    operation, and he and I got along very well and worked well together. So what
                    started out as a frustrating experience became during the last two years a very
                    rewarding experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about LBJ's visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MORAD: LBJ's visit was an incredible circus. He was there, not on an official
                    state visit to El Salvador, but to attend the Central American Chiefs of State
                    Summit. The purpose of the summit was to accelerate economic development and
                    strengthen anti-Castroism and anti-communism. All those issues were important in
                    the 1960s, and it was hoped the summit would strengthen Central American resolve
                    to address them. There was always this fear that Central America was the weak
                    link or that any given country within Central America that went communist would
                    cause a Domino Theory collapse of the other countries because they were always
                    so unstable. The summit had all the paraphernalia of a presidential visit. All
                    pressed into this tiny country, into very compressed space, with few resources.
                    The thing that impressed me most about Lyndon Johnson was that he was commanding
                    figure in person. He was literally larger than life. He was amazing. I was never
                    that sympathetic to him or his administration, personally, although I consider
                    myself a Democrat and a liberal. It was maybe due to an odious comparison
                    between Johnson and, of course, everybody's hero at the time, John F. Kennedy,
                    but I changed my views of him after that. He handled himself in a way “Latinos”
                    respond to, backslapping, personal, and cowboyish. Lady Bird Johnson was very
                    dignified and I think an outstanding first lady. One interesting story was that
                    Johnson wanted to talk to Somoza, who was the dictator of Nicaragua at the time
                    and somehow couldn't seem to buttonhole him. Somebody told him that Somoza was
                    in the men's room, so he made a beeline for it but Somoza's body guards wouldn't
                    allow him to enter without the Boss' permission. For me, personally, the visit
                    was quite tumultuous because in the midst of working 24 hours a day and being
                    involved in everything that a presidential visit entails, my wife had a
                    miscarriage. I was called away to rush to the hospital where she had been taken.
                    That was a week of high excitement as well as personal sadness and
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I got married while I was in Brazil. Before marrying, my wife stayed on in
                    Spain after I left, to complete her professional studies. I came back and then
                    went to Brazil. She returned home to Mexico City. She is an American, but grew
                    up in Mexico City where her father was an executive with an American firm. It
                    was in February of 1963 that we got married. I flew up to Mexico and we had a
                    large wedding there, a mixture of her family and friends and some of my family
                    members who flew down from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Washington. Now you are Public Affairs
                        Advisor at the United States Mission to the Organization of American
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>P.A. ADVISOR TO BUREAU OF AMERICAN REPUBLICS</p>
                <p>MORAD: There was a problem with the conception of that job because, initially, I
                    was the Advisor, but physically remained in the Office of Latin American Affairs
                    in USIA.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an awkward situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: And after a couple of months of trying to do it from a distance, I
                    recommended the position either be abolished or that I be transferred to the
                    State Department. And I was transferred over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: To the Mission in the State Department. US/OAS is part of the American
                    Republics Bureau in the State Department. In fact, at the time, John Hova was
                    the United States representative and the Deputy US representative was Henry
                    Catto, who of course many years later became Director of the Agency. I think
                    this was his first official appointment as a government official. My job wasn't
                    very satisfactory. I didn't find that there was enough interest in the
                    Organization of American States among the American press or at least that I was
                    capable of generating to satisfy a full time position. At that time there were a
                    lot of Inter-American conferences, usually about economic development or
                    democracy and they were held in various locations in the hemisphere. Often I
                    went on these trips as spokesman for the delegation, and I think in that context
                    I was useful. Less useful in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you then move to the American Republics
                        Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The State Department Officer who was the Public Affairs Advisor to the
                    Bureau of American Republics Affairs was transferred. I was offered the job, but
                    as it turned out I already had an assignment. I was going to be assigned to
                    Portugal as Cultural Affairs Officer; a job that I wasn't enthusiastic about,
                    but I wanted to leave Latin American affairs and get back to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also get out of Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I wanted my next assignment to be in Europe if at all possible and that
                    was the only job available, so I accepted it and of course I knew Portuguese.
                    Then Bob Amerson, again my benefactor, offered me a deal; he asked me to stay on
                    in Washington for another year and take the job as Public Affairs Advisor to the
                    Bureau of American Republics Affairs, which was a major position—much higher
                    than my personal grade and which was positive from a career advancement
                    viewpoint. Amerson, in exchange, said he would assign me as Information Officer
                    in Madrid a year later because he was going there as Public Affairs Officer.
                    Those were the days when area directors could manipulate that sort of thing more
                    easily than they can today.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Area directors had a lot more power in the earlier days of
                        the Agency than later on. I think they got some of it back later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: They went in cycles. He was a senior officer and highly respected, so he
                    could negotiate all those things. Of course, I was somewhat concerned because he
                    was leaving immediately for Madrid and wouldn't be around Washington to ensure
                    my assignment. Would anybody remember the agreement? Would I lose my European
                    assignment? Those were my concerns. But I didn't think about it too seriously
                    because I was enthusiastic about the Public Affairs position, in fact, I
                    wouldn't have minded staying on even another year because it was the most
                    rewarding job that I had in Washington, mainly because it was a real line
                    function. Most Agency jobs are support functions for overseas operations, but
                    there was a real operational validity to the job of dealing with the American
                    and Latin American press. We had an audience in the United States as well as in
                    Latin America. And it was a big operation. It was combined with the AID
                    information office as well and I was in charge of about 25 people. In addition,
                    I was advisor to the State Department spokesman, who happened to be Charlie Bray
                    and who later became Deputy Director of the Agency. In that job I found myself
                    in a sense in the inner sanctum of the Bureau of American Republic Affairs at
                    the State Department. Every morning I attended the inner core staff meeting of
                    the Assistant Secretary of State, the Deputy, and the upper echelon of the
                    Bureau. That was a great experience; one with professional growth involved as
                    well. I came away with a tremendous amount of respect for the State Department,
                    which is something one infrequently hears from USIA officers.</p>

                    And the amount of hard work that is put in there is truly amazing. People work
                    12, 13, 14, 18 hours a day. I was forced to just by being part of it. Often I
                    slept in my office, believe it or not. It was a big office with one of those old
                    federal leather couches. I slept in there maybe a half dozen times during that
                    year because of work demands.</p>

                        America at the time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MORAD: I seemed to be fortunate in a sense that I was in various places where
                    there was a lot of interest at that particular moment when they are not high
                    priority areas in the normal course of things. But the key country in Latin
                    America then was Chile, under the Allende government. Allende was expropriating
                    Anaconda and ITT's operations and of course without compensation, so 90% of the
                    issues that we were dealing with related to compensation for the expropriation
                    of American interests in Chile, plus dealing with the socialist Allende
                    government and all that represented to the United States in those days. Looking
                    back on it, of course, it seems somewhat ludicrous. But at the time, Allende was
                    seen to be an enemy of America because he allowed the Communist Party to make
                    serious inroads in a major Latin American country, which was a key issue for the
                    U.S. at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I returned to Madrid and found a completely different country from the one
                    I had left 12 years earlier. It evolved so much. Spain in 1960 and 1961 still
                    was largely, one could say, in the 16th century, evident not only in the
                    architecture but in the way people lived their lives. And it was a very poor
                    country still, poor with dignity. In 1960, Franco had an iron grip on the
                    country and the government, and maintained a repressive regime with little
                    flexibility. Much of that changed 12 years later. Franco was still in power; the
                    structure was still there, but society was changing around him. The people were
                    becoming increasingly free, and the country was more prosperous, especially in
                    the cities. The people were more Westernized, Europeanized and even Americanized
                    in their thinking, and in their interests. By then the country alas had been
                    open to massive tourism for over a decade, so that in the summer Spain doubled
                    its population with tourists. All of them had a major influence on the social
                    and political thinking of Spaniards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the other influences beside tourism? The

                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MORAD: There were two major influences. The establishment of our military bases
                    there in 1953 began the opening of Spain to Western Europe and to our allies and
                    really to the 20th century in many ways. That gave some legitimacy to Franco
                    that he had not had since the end of World War II and then that legitimacy gave
                    rise to other developments. The tourists gradually came to the country giving
                    Spaniards exposure to other people for the first time. The Swedes, the Germans,
                    and the French helped to open the country to modern ways and Spaniards
                    themselves changed as a result. There was also American and Western European
                    investment. The AID programs did not seem relatively as important as the other
                    elements, the military and, what I think was extremely important, exchange
                    programs. As a component of our military assistance, as part of the price we
                    paid for maintaining our military bases in Spain, we had a very large economic
                    and cultural assistance program. As part of that, educational exchange was a
                    major component and a lot of Spaniards over the years came to the United States
                    and Americans went to Spain on those programs, including the Fulbright
                    Program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The Fulbright Commission actually was in charge of administering the
                    military side of the exchange program as well, so it became probably one of the
                    most important Fulbright Commissions in the world because it had all of these
                    additional resources and responsibilities to administer. Over the years, little
                    by little, all of these people coming to the United States and American students
                    studying in Spain had a truly a major impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American Center when you were there the
                        second time. That was a new location.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MORAD: It was there and very centrally located. The Center played a major role in
                    domestic politics of Spain at the time. It was close to the end of the Franco
                    regime which was still repressive but becomingly increasingly benign. If
                    opponents did not directly challenge the legitimacy of Franco, the military, the
                    church, and the monarchy, basically they could say almost anything and get away
                    with it, and there were a lot of challenges. The big question was when was
                    Franco going to die and what was going to happen after him. Nobody was overtly
                    trying to overthrow Franco at that time because it was just a matter of months
                    when he was expected to die; as a matter of fact, there were a lot of jokes
                    about Franco's death and mortality at the time. One joke had it that he was
                    lying on his deathbed and millions of people gathered at the window below his
                    bedroom and were shouting “Franco, Franco, Franco” and he whispered to his wife
                    and said: “What is that?” She said: “It's the people”. “What do they want?”, he
                    asked. She said: “They have come to say goodbye”. Then he said: “Where are they
                    going?” Another joke had him at an annual pilgrimage to Lourdes, amidst hundreds
                    of thousands of people and he collapsed and died on the spot and everybody was
                    looking down at him and they all started shouting “milagro, milagro” (miracle,
                    miracle). There were a lot of jokes like that at the time. Anyway, the Cultural
                    Center programming was strongly influenced by the CAO, who I admired very much,
                    who discreetly allowed the Center to be used as a forum for discussions of
                    internal Spanish politics mainly among the democratic opposition. As a result a
                    lot of lectures, seminars, discussions, and round tables were held and would
                    draw full houses, I mean literally, people cramming to the walls. The crowds
                    would have these tremendously animated discussions having nothing to do with the
                    United States, but solely with Spanish politics and Spain's future. The fact
                    that the United States Embassy through its Cultural Center made the forum
                    possible gave us more credit and goodwill than we could have gotten doing
                    anything else in Madrid at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that the United States Government and USIS
                        in particular helped influence the movement toward a more liberal type of
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I think we did. The United States government was heavily criticized by
                    liberals for supporting the Franco regime. Their argument was that we were
                    sacrificing Spanish democracy and freedom for the sake of our military bases,
                    which was basically true. On the other hand, our presence there also helped to
                    stabilize the situation. While it may have prolonged Franco's regime, our
                    presence allowed the country to evolve sociologically, mentally and gradually in
                    a way that permitted a peaceful transformation from Franco and dictatorship to
                    democratic institutions after his death. The people were truly ready for it and
                    there was no longer any serious opposition to democracy. An old guard fringe of
                    right wingers did try to cause some disruption, but they had no support
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think Spain was a good role model then for Latin
                        America— a lot of countries in Latin America with military
                        dictatorships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MORAD: I don't really know that with certainty, but my own feeling is that
                    Pinochet patterned himself after Franco. Pinochet saw himself as saving the
                    country from communism through what was a socialist government not a communist
                    one, but in those days distinctions were not often made. Essentially Pinochet
                    sat on Chile in a repressive way but allowed some freedom mainly in business and
                    economics. He created a free market economic system with American advisors. That
                    in itself influenced the political situation, and as it evolved, the country
                    also gained some prosperity under Pinochet as Spain gradually did under Franco.
                    Similarly, when Pinochet finally left you had a peaceful transition to a real
                    democratic regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the Spanish model might be valid in regard to
                        the U.S. embargo against Cuba and the recent controversy about China.....
                        whether we should stop trade of continue it? The United States embargo has
                        been in effect for 30 years against Cuba, and there are those who think it
                        should continue, particularly the Cubans in Miami. And there are those who
                        think lifting the embargo would have a much greater influence on encouraging
                        democratic development in Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I guess I side with the latter. I think Cuba has become a domestic
                    political issue more then a foreign policy issue in the United States. Without
                    the influence, the very strong domestic influence that the Cubans have in the
                    United States today, and policy would be the latter in Cuba. I mean, Castro does
                    not pose a serious threat to anybody anymore, and I think opening up Cuba as we
                    did in Spain would render Castro obsolete in his own country even if he remained
                    in power. And that is what happened to Franco; he essentially became obsolete
                    though during the last five years or so of his regime nobody paid much attention
                    to him.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MORAD: You asked the question about the role the United States had in influencing
                    the situation. Well, we also had a negative role in that we caved in to Franco
                    government pressures not to have any contact with the democratic opposition. So
                    for years these people were very frustrated because they couldn't get anywhere,
                    and it was State Department and American Embassy policy to bar them, basically
                    put them in the same category as communists. In defiance of that short-sighted
                    policy and the same USIS officer who gave a forum to democratic opposition at
                    the cultural center, developed personal relations with a large number of the
                    democratic opposition, which later became the power elite in Spain. He was doing
                    this because he was personally liberal and very idealistic. The ambassador at
                    the time got wind of it and wanted to PNG him. He was allowed to stay on but it
                    stalled his career. He didn't advance as fast as he should have, and he was
                    never given the credit or recognition that he deserved for being the only
                    embassy officer who for four years toward the end of the Franco regime,
                    cultivated contact with these people. The CIA may have had some clandestine
                    contact, that I don't know, but at least openly and officially they were barred.
                    Finally through serendipity a new ambassador arrived the year before Franco
                    died. That ended the traditional of assigning political appointees to Franco
                    Spain, which was considered of marginal importance but a nice plum for political
                    supporters. The Senior State Department career officer assigned was Wells
                    Stabler. He was able to analyze that the end of the Franco regime was
                    approaching and had to pave the way for new leadership. During that last year,
                    he cultivated that same people befriended by the USIS officer. I was also part
                    of that effort. I used to bring journalists to lunch with him usually 3 or 4
                    journalists from the democratic left. By the time Franco died, our relationships
                    were very good with these key people. It was very fortunate because it just as
                    easily could have happened the other way; if Franco had died a year or two
                    earlier, we would have been faced with a lot of people who had become important
                    and were hostile to or resentful of the United States for having barred them
                    from participation in or serious discussions about the future of their country.
                    Franco died the year before I left Spain. He had a six-week death vigil in which
                    there were more than 2,000 journalists in Madrid waiting for his death. Because
                    they could get no information at all from the Franco Government, they came to
                    the next best source, the American Embassy. I had to feed morsels to journalists
                    from all over the world even though it was not our responsibility to be
                    spokesman for the Franco Government. We should not have been saying anything
                    about Franco's condition and we didn't officially or openly. Informally, I did
                    share the little information we had in an effort to be open and informative
                    while trusting the journalists not to reveal their sources. Of course, we didn't
                    really know that much ourselves, but we were able to help the journalists
                    produce copy during that prolonged vigil. Spain also turned out to be an
                    exciting assignment in other ways. We had three vice presidential visits and a
                    presidential visit while I was there. Also at that time Kissinger's Middle East
                    shuttle was going on and he always had to stop off at Torrejon Air Base for a
                    refueling stop on his way to the Middle East. The refueling always took place in
                    the middle of the night. Kissinger was there with a plane full of journalists
                    too, so I and my USIS colleagues would have to go out there and set up an entire
                    press operation to make sure these guys could file copy when they got off the
                    plane. This was always at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. Complicating the visits
                    was the Spanish Foreign Minister always insisting on being there and Kissinger's
                    annoyance at having him there. Because the Foreign Minister insisted on being
                    there and we could not refuse him, we had to set up a whole protocol situation
                    for what should have been no more than a technical stopover. I remember one
                    night about 3 o'clock in the morning; we were all there, in a large waiting
                    room, Kissinger with his entourage, the Spanish Foreign Minister with his
                    entourage and three or four of us from the embassy. The Spanish Foreign Minister
                    got up and excused himself to go to the bathroom, just as he walked out of the
                    room, Kissinger asked in a loud voice: “How do you say horse's ass in Spanish?”
                    We were all shocked. The other Spaniards were still in the room and they all
                    spoke English fluently. We thought we were all going to be PNGed the next
                    day.</p>

                <p>MORAD: Yes. Actually I had been assigned as PAO to Peru but I had a daughter who
                    was four years old at the time and was born with a moderate case of cerebral
                    palsy. She required a sophisticated form of physical therapy. I did a lot of
                    research to determine whether a qualified therapist in that specialty was
                    available in Peru. Finally, I was advised that it would not be a good idea to go
                    there given my daughter's condition. I canceled the assignment and came back to
                    Washington for what normally wouldn't have been a Washington tour for me. I
                    should have gone on another overseas assignment. One reason I had so many
                    Washington assignments relative to overseas assignments was my daughter and her
                    need for physical therapy.</p>
                <p>POLICY OFFICER FOR LATIN AMERICA 1976-78Debates on reorganizing USIA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became policy officer; did you replace me? What I know
                        is that I went to Peru as PAO because you were supposed to go and couldn't
                        for the reason you just stated and so this affected my life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Were you policy officer?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in A.R.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Then I replaced you. For two years. Bob Chatten was the area director, and
                    when I came aboard Vic Olason also arrived as the Deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from July 1976 to September of 1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MORAD: Right. It was an interesting assignment; I enjoyed it. The big thing going
                    on at the Agency at the time were meetings about the reorganization of USIA at
                    the onset of the Carter Administration. Various proposals to reorganize USIA
                    were debated furiously. There were literally dozens of meetings going on at all
                    levels to debate the reorganization. Bob Chatten was very much involved in most
                    of them, often taking a contrary point of view from the one that was officially
                    proposed. Following were those interminable debates over the internal
                    organization of USIA, which were stimulated by Alan Carter and Charlie Bray.
                    USIA had to find a new way of doing business, for Carter had created the
                    so-called infomat system in Japan, which he was trying to apply to the Agency as
                    a whole. The essence of it was that USIA should direct all of its programs to an
                    elite audience of decision makers and opinion leaders who should be very clearly
                    identified, and all of our programs should be clearly identified. According to
                    Carter, all our programs should be limited to reaching those people in a very
                    systematic way. He also advocated that nearly all programming should be
                    centrally controlled and organized from Washington, so that essentially USIS
                    posts abroad would be relegated to the end of a marionette string under the
                    control of the masters in Washington. Much of the debate at the time was between
                    people who believed that USIA should be run as a centralized operation and
                    others who believed in continued decentralization with USIS posts largely
                    responsible for their own programming. The debates were pretty vicious and the
                    two most vocal spokespersons for keeping the Agency decentralized were Bob
                    Chatten and Jody Lewinsohn. They took courageous positions at a time when it was
                    difficult to do that, and, in the end, Agency management became so irritated
                    with them they were transferred abroad. They transferred Bob to Thailand as
                    PAO—an assignment he didn't want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. He had to study Thai for a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It was painful for him, and, of course the whole Thai experience was
                    painful. I mean, he saw himself legitimately as a Latin Americanist, and I think
                    he had realistic hopes of becoming an ambassador in Latin America one day. In
                    Jody's case, she went to South Africa, where she did not want to go as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Reinhardt was the Agency Director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: He was the Agency Director, and, in a way, I hate to say it, but think he
                    was one of the least effective directors that the Agency has had even though as
                    a person I liked him very much. As Director of the Agency, he was not a very
                    strong leader. He allowed a lot of misconceived ideas to rule Agency operations
                    during that period. Apart from that, I respect him for his own career success
                    and like him as a person.</p>
                <p>COMMUNICATIONS TENSIONS</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was the time of so called “communications
                        tensions.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: So called “Communications Tensions” between the U.S. and host country had
                    to be written into each post's country plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That caused a great deal of controversy, particularly
                        among field officers who could not understand what it was all about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I always thought it was a misguided idea or attempt by too many Agency
                    officers to create something scientific out of a profession that by its nature
                    cannot be systematized right down to the last letter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still the case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COUNTRY PLANS &amp; TARGET AUDIENCES</p>
                <p>MORAD: To be able to write a Country Plan and all of its specifics and hold to
                    that over a period of a year or two is so unrealistic. I think most rational,
                    experienced officers felt that way and because they did, no matter what
                    Washington said, the people who were actually running the programs in the field
                    did what they wanted to do; they did what they thought was realistically the job
                    to be done in the host country regardless of what Washington had to say. What
                    happened was Washington got a lot of lip service back from the field; it got a
                    lot of jargon and Country Plans that seemed as though posts were doing what
                    Washington dictated, but, in reality, it was pretty much business as usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But don't you think that you need some kind of format or
                        Country Plan concept to at least keep within limits or boundaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MORAD: Oh, yes. I do think you need a Country Plan, but I think it should be
                    flexible and one that tries to reflect the reality of the world you are dealing
                    with locally. Also, I've become more of a believer in target audiences then I
                    was originally. Having come from journalism, I was a mass media person and
                    always liked the idea of the bigger the audience the better. Selectivity was
                    less important. I think selecting a highly targeted audience was a sophisticated
                    idea that came out of advertising and public relations, which I personally did
                    not have much regard for as somebody who considered himself a journalist.
                    Eventually I came to respect the cruel reality of limited resources. We had to
                    be selective in who we were directing programs and activities to. Realistically
                    speaking, there wasn't much purpose in sending a hundred thousand pamphlets out
                    to the peasants of Brazil and El Salvador when they had no influence on their
                    country's policies and directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right! Now, when you finished your tour as Policy Officer,
                        then you went back to school in a way. You went to the Senior Seminar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THE SENIOR SEMINAR</p>
                <p>MORAD: I went to the Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The most prestigious seminar in the Foreign Service
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I guess you can say that, but there are other people who that say that the
                    Senior Seminar is a one year “dumping ground” for people foreign affairs
                    agencies cannot find assignments for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, so many ambassadors who go up through the ranks have
                        experienced the Senior Seminar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I think the Senior Seminar has gone through cycles. It was highly
                    prestigious, and then, I think, for a while, the various agencies, primarily the
                    State Department, used it as a holding operation for people for whom they
                    couldn't find assignments, for one reason or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course the State Department is notoriously top heavy in
                        the Senior Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The seminar lost a little bit of its glow for a while, but from what I
                    understand, it's back now to being a prestigious assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your year there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It was magnificent! It was one of the most stimulating and rewarding year
                    I ever had in my life. It was just incredible, the kind of experience that money
                    couldn't pay for, because you had to have the institutional support to be able
                    to do the kinds of things that were offered there, and essentially lectures and
                    round table discussions with an endless parade of key policy makers in
                    Washington. Scientists, cultural figures, social gurus and the like exposed us
                    to developments in fields that were totally unrelated to our careers. We
                    traveled nearly two weeks out of each month. We visited everything from the New
                    Orleans Port Authority to spending a day with the top hierarchy of Boeing
                    Aircraft Co. and Delta Airlines, four hours with the mayor of New York, two
                    hours with the mayor of Los Angeles. We also went on patrols in the middle of
                    the night with the Chicago police force. Really, a wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So broadening!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: And in an intellectual sense that was where I first became exposed to the
                    idea that the Soviet Union was a paper tiger, that the Soviet Union was facing
                    increasing economic difficulty, that the “nationalities question” was a real
                    “Achilles heel” for the Soviet Union because the nature of the population was
                    such that the European population was declining and the Oriental population was
                    growing and more and more the military was relying on Muslims and Georgians and
                    other ethnics, whose loyalty they couldn't absolutely count on. All the
                    demographic flaws in the Soviet Union that had not yet become public knowledge
                    were discussed with us by academic and government experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a well-kept secret.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it came as a surprise when it finally collapsed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Lectures, articles and press interviews on the subject from CIA officers,
                    Defense people, and demographic experts little by little, raised some public
                    awareness, but my Senior Seminar Tour preceded that. So it was illuminating.
                    I'll leave it at that, it was a glorious experience, and I feel fortunate to
                    have been one of the officers who had the opportunity to take advantage of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you finished that seminar, you became Deputy
                        Director of the Office of European Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR—WESTERN EUROPE</p>
                <p>MORAD: That was a big surprise because in fact, I did not know what my next
                    assignment was going to be and had not spent any time lobbying for a particular
                    assignment. And I did not have close ties to the European area; my only
                    assignments in Europe had been in Spain, and up to that point Spain was never
                    really seen as an integral part of Western Europe, especially in Agency
                    operations. It was more seen to be an extension of Latin America because of the
                    language than it was a Western European post; so I didn't have close ties to the
                    Western European area. Then one day, close to the end of my assignment at the
                    Senior Seminar, I got a telephone call from Charlie Bray, who was the Deputy
                    Director of the Agency at the time, and he asked me if I was interested in the
                    job. I nearly collapsed; I said “definitely, but have you talked to Jodie
                    Lewinsohn and to the big guns in the European area?” I mean, there is no way
                    they would have chosen me for that job, because I know they all had their own
                    cronies that they supported. He said: “Well, the decision is already made. If
                    you want the job you can have it.” So I was very grateful to him for that, and
                    to this day I still don't know how I got the assignment, except that I had
                    worked with Charlie at the State Department when I was there as Public Affairs
                    Advisor. I attended his daily meetings that prepared him for the noon press
                    briefing and had on-and-off other contact with him as well. He was still
                    relatively new to the Agency, so my theory is that when he was presented with a
                    list of names of candidates of people at the appropriate grade level, he
                    recognized mine. He didn't recognize anybody else's and he selected me for the
                    job. Anyway that turned out to be one of my two favorite assignments. Terry
                    Catherman came in at the same time as Area Director and Len Baldyga, who was
                    with me at the Senior Seminar, became the Deputy for Eastern Europe when I was
                    the Deputy for Western Europe. We were all new replacements of the previous
                    regime there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And at that time did the geographic directors have the
                        title of Assistant Directors of USIA, in this case for Europe, and so on, or
                        had it changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: No. They were directors of the office of their particular geographic
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Among them, I handled most personnel matters for Western Europe.</p>

                <p>THE ROLE OF WIVES—Changing Times</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MORAD: It was often a very touchy and sensitive business to be involved in. We
                    too often had unreasonable ambassadors who wanted their PAOs removed
                    unjustifiably. And dealing with them and trying to get them to be patient and
                    change their mind and that sort of thing was required. But one of the things I
                    remember was that this was the time when wives, were gaining their independence
                    from the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gaining their independence from the ambassador's

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: More and more they were seen not to be official partner's of their
                    husbands' careers and whose performance were judged at least partially on the
                    performance of their wives such as how well they entertained or how social they
                    were and that sort of thing. As I traveled around Western Europe, I met with all
                    staff members, and often had dinner with the American officers and their
                    spouses. This issue kept coming up time and time again, in fact more than any
                    single issue because it was reaching its fruition at that time. Now it is an
                    accepted reality, and I think not discussed as much. At that time people were
                    still in the experimental stage of how to handle spousal independence. The thing
                    that impressed me most was how generational the issue had been. It was almost
                    exclusively the younger wives who wanted to have nothing to do with their
                    husband's career, the ambassadors' wives, entertaining, or doing anything that
                    they personally did not want to do. And it was the older wives who still felt a
                    sense of camaraderie and community and obligation to help their husbands and
                    help the embassy. But the practical effect of all of this was that wive's clubs
                    and women's organizations, especially in Western Europe, more than in third
                    world countries were ceasing to exist. More and more people were regretting this
                    because the wives suddenly didn't have anywhere to go and anything to do. I mean
                    they were off on their own and had no institutional importance any more. The
                    younger wives really did not care but the older wives did. They didn't want to
                    be independent or get their independence; they still wanted to be considered as
                    a working team with their husbands. So in the context of dinners with the
                    American staffs conversations often turned into tirades almost always along
                    generational lines, about whether independence for wives was a good thing or a
                    bad thing. Of course, its been resolved in favor of the younger wives. Clubs and
                    the like still exist but, I think, without the same fervor that they had when we
                    were young officers.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MORAD: PAO Brussels, which was to be my first Public Affairs and only PAO
                    position. I knew the opening was coming up. I was in a position to influence it.
                    One of the unfortunate things for me twice was that my two best assignments in
                    Washington came at the end of my Washington tours. I had already been in
                    Washington for three years when I was assigned as Deputy. So at the end of two
                    years as Deputy, I had to leave and go back overseas. Also, within a year after
                    I left, Terry Catherman left unexpectedly as well. He became PAO in Paris, and
                    had I still been in EU, there would have been at least a 50-50 possibility that
                    I could have replaced him as Area Director, since I was the Deputy for Western
                    Europe, which was seen technically as the senior of the two deputies. The fact
                    is that even though Western Europe was seen to be more important, in the office
                    context Eastern Europe was much more important because we had all of these
                    cultural agreements with the Eastern European countries. The only way we could
                    maintain programs there was to have annually negotiated cultural agreements,
                    which specified every program we were going to carry out in their countries and
                    they were going to carry out in the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The communist countries insisted on it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes. We hated those agreements, but it was the only way they would allow
                    us to function; so every year, I think with each government we had to have a
                    negotiating conference and then endless follow-up conferences and correspondence
                    to reach agreements. These took up a tremendous amount of time of the Area
                    office, and made them virtually the most important thing the Area office did. In
                    the Western European context, we had nothing that formalized our programs, and
                    the issues were among our allies. So there was nothing as pressing in terms of
                    workloads and deadlines compared to those cultural agreements that burdened the
                    Eastern Europe side of the office.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also had Canada in your Western European Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes. Jack Shellenberger was the PAO in Canada at the time. One of my most
                    pleasant experiences as Deputy was visiting the post. It was the first time I'd
                    ever been in Canada, and I had a great experience with him in Ottawa and then in
                    Montreal. Next we flew across the country to Vancouver because there were some
                    proposals to close the branch post there. Those proposals have existed ever
                    since. I don't think it ever closed. But these proposals existed even then, and
                    I went there to check them out. I have to admit I did the conventional thing. I
                    supported maintaining the office.</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MORAD: Today, I guess I would take a different point of view. It was a wonderful
                    assignment for anybody who was fortunate enough to go there, I'll tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you arrived in Brussels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PAO BRUSSELSThe nuclear missile deployment crises</p>
                <p>MORAD: Then I went to Brussels as PAO. Brussels, while it's a small country, was
                    not seen to be a small PAOship at the time because it was the headquarters for
                    NATO, the European Community and, in general, seen as the capital of European
                    institutions, although that is debatable. It had a lot of high level traffic:
                    Secretaries of State and Defense came through twice a year along with a
                    continuous parade of Washington VIPs which gave it a lot more importance than a
                    small post like that normally would have. Also, that was the period during when
                    the United States was trying to deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles in
                    Western Europe or I should say, NATO was. This became a very controversial
                    political issue in the five countries where deployment was designated, Belgium
                    being one of them. The two countries that had the most domestic local opposition
                    to deployment were Belgium and Netherlands. And so it became a public affairs
                    issue more than a political issue because the government supported the
                    deployment; but in Europe you had these weak coalition governments that could
                    fall at the drop of a hat and you could not put too much pressure on them or
                    they collapsed. These issues were of such tremendous intensity with public
                    opinion polls showing nearly 70% of the population opposed to deployment of
                    nuclear weapons on their soil. In engaging in these arguments with the
                    Europeans, we would ask “Well, why should the United States protect Europe with
                    nuclear weapons when Europe is unwilling to have nuclear weapons on its own soil
                    to protect itself?” The common European response: “Oh, yes, but that is
                    different. You see, you are a huge country. You can have your nuclear weapons
                    out in the desert near Utah, Idaho or Montana, and if they became a target,
                    those are sparse population areas and there would not be much heavy damage. In
                    Holland, all it takes is one bomb to obliterate the country and the population.”
                    We would reply: “The people of Montana, Idaho and Utah don't necessarily feel
                    that they should be vulnerable for the sake of European security.” Anyway, those
                    were the kinds of issues that you would get involved in with an incredible
                    rationalization concerning why they shouldn't have nuclear weapons on their
                    soil. They also argued that just having the weapons made them Soviet targets
                    when they would not be targets otherwise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: We won. The deployment took place in all of the countries, and it was
                    uneventful after that. Once the decision was made and deployment took place, we
                    never heard anything more about it.</p>

                    Thousands of people marching through downtown Brussels, organized by the leftist
                    parties and various kinds of peace groups opposed to it.</p>

                <p>WORLDNET &amp; “LET POLAND BE POLAND”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MORAD: Correct. Throughout Western Europe, including Belgium, that was the issue
                    we dealt with most. One exception to that was the military coup that took place
                    in Poland; Charlie Wick, who was the Director of the Agency, created this
                    television extravaganza “Let Poland be Poland” to muster world opinion against
                    the cause and this was shortly after I had arrived. But let me go back a couple
                    of steps. Charlie Wick's major priority project at the time was getting Worldnet
                    launched. That global television network was basically being launched country by
                    country, primarily in Western Europe at the time, and Belgium was one of those
                    early launch countries. Unfortunately, before Charlie Wick arrived, European
                    posts for a number of years had written off television. Television was
                    considered an activity that we should no longer be heavily involved with because
                    we couldn't compete with or place programs on sophisticated European televisions
                    stations and because there was no need to program to European mass audiences. We
                    couldn't get our programs on local T.V. We were dealing with sophisticated
                    countries and therefore the decision was to use our resources in more people to
                    people exchange programs, and that sort of thing, rather than mass media. As a
                    result, we lost a lot of our contacts with television people, both on the
                    programming and the political sides; then suddenly Charlie Wick comes along and
                    wants to get these major commitments of programming in cooperation with mostly
                    state-owned television operations, highly politicized themselves often headed by
                    leftist political executives. To get their cooperation was a very difficult
                    challenge for PAOs in Western Europe. There was incredible pressure coming from
                    Washington to get Worldnet set up and none of us really knew what Worldnet was,
                    or what it was going to offer, yet we had to get these commitments from the
                    directors of local television...people we didn't really have much contact with
                    any longer. So we moved along gradually, little by little developing their
                    cooperation, getting their interest. But we were still a long way from the close
                    relationships USIS officers often have with journalists, editors and broadcast
                    executives that they have been doing business with for years. Then all of a
                    sudden Charlie Wick conceives “Let Poland be Poland,” a specific program that he
                    wants on the air internationally in prime time on a specific date. He wants
                    major European stations to carry it in the middle of their evening programming
                    schedule. We thought what he wanted was unbelievable. We're not talking about
                    little third world countries. It was like going to CBS and asking them to give
                    us a block of time from 8 to 9 p.m. in the U.S. The French Embassy would never
                    do that. So we were pulling our hair out. It was incredible and so frustrating.
                    We could not get a 100% commitment from Belgium television to carry the program,
                    and, of course, everybody in Europe was laughing at us. It was a ludicrous
                    situation. The whole idea was such a joke with sophisticated Europeans, but we
                    continued to cajole and plead with them. “Don't look on it as a program, I
                    argued; “look on it as Belgium-American cooperation. Help USIS out with this and
                    we will do a favor for you when we can. We have this crazy guy back in
                    Washington, and I am sure if you do it, one way or another you will get credit
                    down the line.” That sort of thing. On and on. Finally they agreed to carry it,
                    but on a delayed basis. The delay was only about two hours however. As it turned
                    out, Belgium was only one of, I think, three or four European countries that
                    actually carried the program within prime time. Many of them didn't carry it at
                    all, others carried excerpts of it on their newscasts, three or four minutes,
                    but others carried it in non-prime time the next day.</p>

                    it was embarrassing. The program had no quality to it whatsoever. It was like
                    one long infomercial, you know, the kind that you see on cable television
                    pushing hair replacement and just not appropriate for a sophisticated European

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Fortunately it didn't torpedo Worldnet and gradually we established a
                    working relationship with television in all these countries. In Rome, in fact,
                    Worldnet became so successful that it quickly wore out its welcome because its
                    software quality couldn't match its hardware capability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like United States television?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Exactly. Worldnet was reaching its prime in Europe when I left Belgium. I
                    moved to France, where we had an even more difficult audience to deal with. We
                    were still in the initial stages, and had a lot of work to do on the format.
                    Worldnet initially was composed essentially of press conferences with American
                    officials. It featured an American official on a given subject in Washington or
                    somewhere in the United States and a collection of journalists locally. It was
                    one-way video, where they would ask questions and the figure would reply. That
                    was essentially the format. The problem with it was that Charlie Wick, or the
                    powers that be in Washington—I wasn't there at the time—decided to offer us,
                    one, two, three or four of these talking head formats. They must have figured
                    that if one was successful, two would be more successful, and four would even be
                    more successful than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Eisenhower's press conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MORAD: Same idea. There weren't enough issues of interest and they required
                    journalists to take time off in the middle of their workday, to attend. If we
                    didn't have a real breaking story for them, they couldn't care less. They didn't
                    care about background stuff or the Assistant Secretary of State, unless it was
                    something really unique. You may get one or two journalists who would be
                    interested in the background of some economic issue, but for the most part they
                    looked at Worldnet as a source for a breaking story, and if we could not produce
                    the goods, they became disappointed and disgruntled. That is exactly what
                    happened more and more frequently, and as a result, fewer and fewer journalists
                    attended. George Shultz was Secretary of State at the time, and, for some
                    reason, some misguided people talked him into going on Worldnet too often. We
                    were getting him sometimes two and three times a month, and you know Shultz, he
                    never really had much to say or was willing to say it in a public forum. So we
                    had to go to all this trouble to attract journalists. “The Secretary of State is
                    going to speak on such and such a subject,” we would call up and tell all these
                    guys. They would show up and ask a question and the response more often than not
                    would be “no comment”. He invariably had little to say in his opening remarks,
                    and he rarely would answer their questions candidly. Inevitably, the journalists
                    asked “Why did you call us here, we thought you had something to say?” Because
                    that wore out Worldnet's welcome as a press conference device, we began urging
                    the agency to stop the regularly scheduled Worldnets. We don't need them on a
                    regularly scheduled basis. We argued that less frequently and more substance
                    would gain greater credibility. People would then see Worldnet programming as an
                    important event.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, you had a staffing problem at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Oh, a tremendous staffing problem. It was eating up so many of our
                    resources. We ended up having two Americans on Worldnet alone. We couldn't
                    afford it.</p>

                <p>MORAD: I wasn't fired from the Agency nor from my career but at the demand of the
                    ambassador to Charlie Wick, who caved in, I lost my job there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the ambassador wanted one of his friends

                <p>MORAD: No. The curious thing about it was that the reason for my dismissal was
                    never explained to me. To this day, no one has ever told me. Not the ambassador
                    and not the people on the Washington side who were involved, namely, Jock
                    Shirley, Len Baldyga, who was the new Area Director nor Barry Fulton, who was
                    the Director of Foreign Service Personnel. Neither did I receive an explanation
                    from Charlie Wick, whom I saw frequently during my tour in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They never told you why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The person I dealt with primarily about the matter was then Counselor Jock
                    Shirley who called me from Washington one day and said, “I've got good news and
                    bad news. The bad news is that you are losing your job in Brussels. The good
                    news is that you are going to be Deputy PAO in Paris.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does that make you I.O. in the United States
                        mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MORAD: What happened was notice of my dismissal came in January of 1983 but the
                    ambassador agreed to let me stay on until the summer so my daughter could
                    complete the school year. So I stayed and worked for him for six months despite
                    the difficulty of knowing that I was working for somebody who had me fired. John
                    Gardner, who was the Deputy PAO in Paris, was supposed to transfer that summer,
                    but he received an extension. The post was in temporary quarters; the Talleyrand
                    Building in Paris, our headquarters was being renovated, and the post was in a
                    disheveled state. So he extended for a year to deal with that situation as the
                    Deputy PAO and Executive Officer. The question of what to do with me during that
                    year arose. The Agency already made the commitment to give me Paris, which was
                    very important to me because Paris is where I always wanted to be—as do many
                    people, often to their own disadvantage, but not to mine. The Paris assignment
                    softened the blow of losing my job in Brussels, but then it looked as though it
                    wasn't going to work out. Jock said: “Come back to Washington for a year and
                    then you can go to Paris.” I said: “There is no way I am going to take my family
                    back to Washington for a year and then go to Paris. Either I stay here or I go
                    back to Washington to stay for a full assignment while I decide what I'll do as
                    far as my career is concerned.” Coincidentally, Steve Strain, the Information
                    Officer at NATO, was two years into a three year assignment there; he had one
                    more year to go. He hated the assignment, the job, and Brussels. He was an
                    Eastern Europeanist and wanted to go back to Eastern Europe. He kept negotiating
                    with Washington but couldn't seem to find anything. Well, I had learned through
                    the grapevine that the Assistant PAO position in Sophia, Bulgaria was opening up
                    unexpectedly, but it was such a lowly position in what seemed to be the worst
                    country in Eastern Europe, that I didn't think he would be interested in it. I
                    talked to Steve about the opening and said: “Look, I can do you a favor. I can
                    get you an Eastern European assignment and you can do me a favor by accepting
                    it, which will allow me to replace you here for a year.” This was all of my own
                    making and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IO NATO</p>
                <p>MORAD: He was actually interested in it. He called Washington. Of course Bulgaria
                    was never a highly sought after assignment. They agency gave him the assignment
                    and Personnel agreed to let me stay in the IO NATO job for a year as a temporary
                    assignment as quiet payment for my unjustifiable dismissal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for that year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MORAD: I was the Information Officer, which is essentially a misnomer; that is
                    the position that administers the NATO tour groups. Are you familiar with the
                    NATO tours? The United States Mission brings groups of Europeans from various
                    countries on visits to NATO and NATO facilities around Europe, for three or more
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To educate them on the purpose of NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes. The posts do the nominating. It is like an exchange program. They can
                    be journalists or political leaders or whatever, educators. And then, that was a
                    major program; lots of money and lots of organizational detail and essentially
                    the Information Officer ran that program. That is what I did for a year. Of
                    course, it was below, way below my grade level and way below the kind of work I
                    should normally have been doing, but under the circumstances, I was happy to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you get to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Just let me go back to Brussels for a minute, because at the time that I
                    was informed that I was losing my job, for some reason it didn't bother me so
                    much, primarily because I saw Paris at the other end; but with the passage of
                    time, I became angrier and more and more bitter about the experience, how it
                    happened and the failure of the Agency to support me against decisions by
                    political appointees which were totally irrational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they never gave you an explanation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: No, the Ambassador was Charlie Price, who went on to become Ambassador to
                    London. That is also part of the story. He inherited a candy company from his
                    father in Kansas. He was also very active in Kansas political affairs; he also
                    became a banker on his own. He started from a family base of wealth. He
                    fundamentally became a banker. And his wife was the daughter of the founder of
                    Swanson's Food, the frozen food company. They were both friends of the Reagans,
                    she, especially, was a close friend of Nancy Reagan. No international or
                    political experience whatsoever, and totally Mid-Western American folks, who
                    suddenly found themselves as Ambassador and Ambassadress.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To one of the most sophisticated countries in the

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MORAD: And with burning issues at the time. But Charlie Price is fundamentally an
                    intelligent person. He just didn't have experience or knowledge of foreign
                    policy at the time. He arrived at the post three weeks before I arrived. Bud
                    Korngold, PAO at the time, was ending a five year assignment there. Bud was Mr.
                    Europe. He still is. He had been in Europe as a correspondent and Bureau Chief
                    for Newsweek.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't he a specialist on Communist Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: He was the editor of Dialogue Magazine. He was hired by the Agency as a
                    domestic employee but later went to Brussels as IO. When the PAO left, Bud
                    replaced him and did an outstanding job. I was the Deputy Director for Western
                    Europe at the time and wrote his performance evaluation for two years. I gave
                    him outstanding marks because he did an excellent job. More importantly, he knew
                    everybody in and everything about Belgium, England and France and was a tireless
                    worker on behalf of the Ambassador. So Charlie Price came to town and Bud became
                    the most important person in the Mission to him. The first three weeks he hosted
                    numerous social affairs and introduced the Ambassador to the world. So, Bud
                    knows everybody and is totally expert and then he leaves. About two weeks go by
                    and Jim Morad arrives, you know, new and relatively uninformed. The contrast,
                    needless to say, was odious. From a new ambassador's viewpoint because he was
                    learning on the job and needed all the help he could get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It usually takes six months at least to find out what is
                        going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MORAD: And at the same time this coincided with tremendous demands on European
                    PAOs by then USIA Director, Charlie Wick. What I discovered in Brussels is that
                    I didn't realize as Deputy in Washington was that while Bud ran all these
                    magnificent and highly visible programs in the support of the previous
                    ambassador, who was also a political appointee, the post itself,
                    institutionally, was a hollow shell. There was virtually no information program.
                    The Information Section had two local guys who stared at each other in a
                    semi-stupor all day long and virtually did nothing else except lunch with
                    cronies. The Cultural side was in better condition because we have a beautiful
                    Cultural Center in Brussels, but the post essentially, institutionally was not
                    functioning. So that is what I inherited to manage at the same time coinciding
                    with my arrival. We had demands to get Worldnet placed, i.e. “Let Poland Be
                    Poland,” on local TV. All of this was a mess with the new Director, Charlie
                    Wick. In addition I had to spend a lot of time on the Public Affairs aspects of
                    the major issue in U.S.-European relations—the deployment of Intermediate
                    Nuclear Range Missiles in NATO countries. Meanwhile the Administrative Counselor
                    for the embassy, who was a conniving, manipulating guy decided that he wanted to
                    take over the Post's printing operation. So during the summer interim, after the
                    time that Korngold left and before I arrived, the admin counselor he had a
                    so-called, time and motion study done of the print shop. He produced the report
                    without ever showing it to anybody in USIS and then presented it to the new
                    Ambassador without showing it to me after I arrived. The report was full of
                    concocted false statistics and recommendations to merge the Embassy's and USIS'
                    print shops under embassy control including giving the embassy two USIS local
                    positions and all our equipment with no reimbursement in exchange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a USIS print shop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MORAD: Yes. Totally and wholly run by USIS that would be incorporated into the
                    Embassy's printing operation, essentially a mimeograph operation with key
                    positions to be turned over to the Embassy. What happens is that a meeting is
                    called to discuss the study. This happens during my first week in Brussels. The
                    Ambassador, who never should have been involved in the issue in the first place
                    because he is a brand new political appointee, calls the meeting. But we had a
                    DCM who was an arms control expert, who couldn't manage anything and couldn't
                    make difficult decisions. He was a total void when it came to administration or
                    management, and he refused to touch the print shop issue; so it went directly to
                    the Ambassador. The Ambassador read the study and accepted it at face value. It
                    read convincingly. Then he called the meeting in question and was shocked to
                    learn that I had not seen the report. So he said: “Why don't you read it and
                    then we'll have a meeting next week.” So I read the thing, studied it, consulted
                    with the staff and learned the whole thing was full of holes and these concocted
                    statistics. I then went to the scheduled meeting and said the report was
                    “bologna.” I argued that USIS needed to maintain control of its own printing
                    operation for reasons familiar to all USIS officers. You know, timeliness,
                    responsiveness, flexibility. We couldn't deal with bureaucratic work orders,
                    that sort of thing. The usual arguments. The meeting then turned into a battle,
                    a screaming and shouting match between me and the Administration Counselor. The
                    worst of me came out. I lost my cool as did the Administrative Counselor in
                    front of a new ambassador, who shouldn't have been involved in the issue in the
                    first place. So it was a bad scene, meanwhile I thought I was protecting the
                    Agency's assets and interests and, of course, reported back to the Agency
                    everything that happened and the threat of the loss of our print shop. I
                    expected to get Agency backing and be defended to the death. Well, in the end,
                    nobody in Washington gave a shit whether we lost the print shop or not. What
                    happened was I guess the Agency had been changing under the new administration.
                    It changed a lot when Charlie Wick took over, but it wasn't common knowledge
                    yet. Who Charlie Wick was and what he was going to do became known to people in
                    Washington, but people out in the field didn't know much at that point. While I
                    was concerned with the Agency's institutional interests the only thing that
                    became important in Washington—and then later in the field—was that Charlie Wick
                    wanted it. As it turned out, I fought this big battle and lost a lot of goodwill
                    before I started at the post and nobody in Washington really cared. The
                    interesting thing was, while I came away feeling bad and not very proud of my
                    own behavior at that meeting, I felt I was doing what was necessary to defend
                    our interest. Curiously after the meeting the Ambassador came down to my office
                    about 15 minutes later and said that he was furious with the Admin-Counselor's
                    handling of the whole issue. First, for producing the report, not showing it to
                    me, and trying to create a “fait accompli”, while people were not in place yet.
                    Second for his performance in the meeting. Astonishingly he asked me: “Would you
                    like me to have him fired?” That turned out to be an ironic story because I
                    said: “No, it was a disagreement; I think he is wrong; I think we need to
                    maintain control of our own print shop, but in the end, it is your decision. I
                    don't want him fired, he is a very competent guy; he is one of the leading
                    counselors the State Department has. Two weeks later, the Ambassador handed down
                    his decision, which I thought was going to produce the worst of all possible
                    worlds, but it turned out to be not so bad. He said “We are going to combine the
                    two print shops and all the resources, but each side is going to continue
                    managing and operating its own affairs. There will be a USIS supervisor for USIS
                    activities, and there will be a State Department supervisor for State Department
                    activities, bulletins and that sort of thing.” I said, “Oh my God, this is going
                    to get us into endless daily conflict.” But as it turned out, the arrangement
                    worked out very well and it was a good compromise decision. That was it! But I
                    think my scorched earth defense was something the Ambassador never forgot. Even
                    though the print shop itself eventually became a dead issue, meanwhile on
                    another front, I made a calculated decision that the Ambassador was not prepared
                    to be exposed to the press in a consistent and heavy duty way at that time. The
                    issues were very sensitive. He was still not up to speed on them. He could be
                    very ambiguous and easily embarrassed at a time when there were a lot of people
                    in Belgium, Europe and American Press who would ask for interviews and could
                    cause him to stumble, embarrass him and embarrass the U.S., particularly on the
                    critical issue of the deployment of missiles. So I thought that we should groom
                    him for about six months and then get him more actively involved with the press.
                    We would still call on editors, meet with journalists and that sort of thing,
                    but nothing really in public. He never complained about this; in fact he always
                    said he did not want to be in the public eye. But I think, as it turned out, he
                    saw other ambassadors around Europe, particularly political ambassadors getting
                    press coverage and he didn't like it. I thing he held this against me without
                    ever really complaining about it directly. And ironically, about the time that I
                    received notice of my premature transfer, I had just developed a written
                    three-page plan Activist Public Affairs paper for the Ambassador because time
                    had passed and he had become more knowledgeable and comfortable with
                    articulating the issues; but before I could present it to him, I received notice
                    of my dismissal. And then he wasn't even in Brussels when this happened; he was
                    in Washington when I was notified; I looked forward to him coming back so I
                    could discuss the matter with him because nobody in Washington would give me a
                    reason for the Ambassador's dissatisfaction. When I asked Jock Shirley why, he
                    said “It doesn't matter why. You are going to Paris and that is all that counts.
                    Forget about it.” And Len Baldyga—the European Area Director— told me that he
                    didn't know because he wasn't privy to the meetings.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Len just retired; maybe he will be able to tell you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I just had lunch with him a couple of weeks ago. He still says he doesn't
                    know. Barry Fulton said he wasn't in the meeting either; he was Foreign Service
                    Personnel Director at the time. He said that was being handled by Charlie Wick
                    and the Ambassador. Jock Shirley was involved because he was the Counselor, but
                    he wouldn't tell me. So I went to talk to the Ambassador about it when he came
                    back. Of course I had to be very careful because of my interests at that time.
                    It was difficult for me, even I would have packed my bags and left, but at that
                    point I was more concerned about my daughter and not pulling her out of school
                    in the middle of the school year. I figured, even though he is capable of
                    getting me fired, he was good enough to agree to let me to stay on until the
                    summer; I didn't want to jeopardize that. So I went to him and said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, I am really sorry that you are dissatisfied with my performance; I
                    thought we had a good relationship here and we were doing a good job.” The
                    Ambassador replied, “Jim, you are doing a fantastic job. There is no problem,
                    everything is great.” Then for the next six months, while I was there, I used to
                    hear that he would tell people in the embassy “Jim Morad is the most brilliant
                    guy on the country team.” But he wouldn't want to talk about his
                    dissatisfaction. It was as though my dismissal hadn't happened. Strange as it
                    seems I never got an explanation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that almost every Foreign Service Officer
                        has had a strange incident. Not exactly like that but something. The way the
                        bureaucracy is, so politicized and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The story became even more bizarre. The Ambassador put me in charge of
                    identifying the candidates for my replacement. So I had to work with Personnel
                    and he would consult with me. “Is he a good person, or is that one a bad
                    person?” Then he insisted on personally interviewing everybody who was a serious
                    candidate. Candidates would fly into Brussels and I had to entertain them, I was
                    their host while they came for job interview to replace me. He finally selected
                    Chris Snow, who was the CAO in London at the time. Chris arrived in the summer
                    of '83. I moved over to NATO on a one-year interim assignment before going to
                    Paris and two months later the Ambassador was transferred to London as
                    Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Everything changed. The Ambassador would have been gone anyway. He
                    wouldn't have had to work with me if he didn't like me. I could have continued
                    my assignment there, presumably with another ambassador who would have felt
                    differently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEPUTY PAO PARIS</p>
                <p>MORAD: I went to Paris as Deputy PAO but I still considered Brussels a watershed
                    that derailed me from what should I say, career advancement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the short range...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: In the short range, somewhat, but I think permanently too because after
                    that I was seen as the PAO who lost his job, who was fired by an Ambassador. I
                    think had I followed the normal progression and had a successful tour in
                    Brussels, my next assignment would have been a larger post and, who knows, I
                    could have been PAO in Paris possibly and gone on from there and become Area
                    Director or higher. So, for the rest of my career, I did think it limited my
                    assignment prospects even though it wasn't visible in any way. One more point on
                    that. While this was going on I asked Len Baldyga, who was my friend and Area
                    Director, “Why isn't the Agency supporting me on this?” He said: “Nobody back
                    here can defend your interests. Don't expect support from anybody,” which was
                    exactly what happened. There is another ironic thing, two other ironic things,
                    in fact. The performance evaluation that I received from the Ambassador and DCM
                    was for that year was one of the best I've received in my entire career. I
                    received a performance evaluation from the Area Office, as well, and it also,
                    was one of the best I've ever received. There was no mention, no reference to
                    the fact that I was fired, that I lost my job, or to any dissatisfaction
                    whatsoever. Everything on the record was as good as it could possibly be. It
                    shows you the hypocrisy, in the situation. To my benefit, had it been on the
                    record, of course, it would have been even more harmful for me, but it still
                    hurt, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It grates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It grates that somehow the record reads so well and the reality reads so
                    differently. To conclude this story with a final irony, despite the Ambassador's
                    feelings reversed about the Admin Counselor over the print shop, even asking me
                    if I thought he should fire him. After the Admin Counselor was returned to
                    Washington at the end of his tour in Brussels and the Ambassador was assigned to
                    London, he specifically requested the Administrative Counselor's assignment in
                    the same position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: C'est la vie! You have not lost your sense of humor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MORAD: Because the irony is so humorous. Also, I'm not the only such victim.
                    Three close friends of mine also lost their jobs since then. One not too long
                    ago. The circumstances in each case were different, but the essence was the
                    same—an ambassador requesting a PAO's departure and the agency going along with
                    it. In one case it was the area director who engineered the dismissal. One can
                    become embittered, and, of course, that is exactly how I became for a while. I
                    went from no response at all, to a sense of gratitude for being able to stay on
                    and because of my family interests and for getting to go to Paris. Those
                    immediate reactions increasingly gave way to anger and frustration over what
                    happened to me. I have seen similar reactions among my friends. However, the
                    curve declined in time, and now I can be humorous about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Paris!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Paris turned out to be a magnificent assignment for me. I was reunited
                    with Terry Catherman. I had been his Deputy in Washington and we resumed the
                    same kind of relationship in Paris. He basically set program goals and I pretty
                    much ran the post on a day-to-day basis. No micro management on his part, and
                    because he had some health problems during that period he was away from the post
                    for a significant part of the first year, so I ran the post as acting PAO,
                    always following his clear guideposts, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you are fluent in French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MORAD: No, I am not fluent in French. I studied French before going to Brussels.
                    I had studied French in college and got into the Agency when candidates had to
                    have foreign language competence to qualify. I qualified with a 1 plus in French
                    but had not spoken at all in nearly 30 years. I took Agency-sponsored French at
                    the International Language Academy on Dupont Circle. I had a private tutor, and
                    got a 3-3 in 14 weeks, which was close to a record. In Brussels I had to speak
                    French, but not consistently. It is a bilingual country and so international
                    that much of our business is conducted in English. But in France you really do
                    conduct business in French. I'd say about 80% of the time. It is important and
                    gratifying to speak French but it is a much more difficult language to master
                    than people realize. It's a romance language, but a very difficult one. The only
                    Americans in the embassy who I considered fluent were those who had childhood
                    exposure to French. Nearly all those who learned it in the Foreign Service and
                    as adults were pretty much like me at about a 3+ and 3 functional level but far
                    from fluent. Contrary to the common view that the French are insulting to
                    foreigners who speak French and make mistakes, I didn't find that to be the case
                    at all. They were always very tolerant; what they did not do is make concessions
                    to you. If you are in a group of 3, 4 or 5 French men or women they wouldn't
                    speak more slowly for you or make any concessions. You either had to keep up or
                    you were lost. That was it. But if you spoke to the group, nobody would make fun
                    of you or insult you because you happened to make a mistake in their language.
                    They are more civilized and cultured than that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: The post had a little center, sort of an adjunct to the library that
                    performed computerized reference and research work for Europe. It was a small
                    operation. In fact we closed it down while I was there. During my assignment in
                    Paris, we had one of those periodic deep Agency budget cuts and we were
                    especially supposed to look at regional operations. That was a regional
                    service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Or they had their own technical capabilities at post to do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a big operation so that maybe you did not get

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MORAD: No, I did not get deeply involved. That was strictly run by the ARS, the
                    African Regional Service, which was basically under the supervision of the AR,
                    The African Area Office. USIS, however, was responsible for ARS' administration,
                    and we were in the same building at the time. We had a lot of serious problems
                    and disagreements over the use of the building, facilities and that sort of
                    thing. One of my regrets was that the two staffs never really had close
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was at the Talleyrand building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, the Talleyrand building, and it is still that way. I have gone back
                    to Paris a number of times since I left there, and it is just kind of endemic.
                    The two operations could be on opposite sides of Paris. The staff just don't
                    have any real interchange. Working in Paris is exciting and covers the whole
                    range of what USIS does at the most sophisticated levels, including an endless
                    parade of visits of high-level Americans. Vice President Bush came there twice.
                    Charlie Wick came there often while I was there. By the time I left, he was on
                    his 19th visit to Paris. I was in charge of preparing and handling 13 of
                    them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VISITS OF DIRECTOR WICK</p>
                <p>MORAD: It was like arranging for a presidential visit.</p>
                <p>He also required press type booklets. You know, the kind we prepare for
                    presidential visits. We had to prepare them in detail, with the schedule, the
                    name, the biography of every person he was going to come in contact with, the
                    issues, restaurant recommendations, all of that. It had to be prepared every
                    time he came to town. We had to have a full-time security escort and that meant
                    being met at the airport and escorted into town by the French security. No other
                    US government official of his level would either demand or receive that kind of
                    treatment. But he demanded and received it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Mary Jane Wick often went there to do her shopping. Whenever she was
                    along, you were talking about $10,000 to $15,000 worth of purchases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long would the Wicks stay when they came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MORAD: Oh, they would stay anywhere from one day to three or four days. A lot of
                    the visits were related to negotiating the Worldnet for downlink contract with
                    the French PTT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Satellite system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Bringing the signal down and disbursing it to other Western European
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That turned out to be a pretty good investment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes it was. And, of course, it was all going on while I was there. A lot
                    of what I did was not only to prepare Wick's visits, but support the negotiating
                    team while it was in town. A couple of times Wick went to Morocco. He was a
                    friend of the King. The King's private plane would fly him back to Paris, where
                    he would stay over for a couple of days. Between Brussels and Paris, I was
                    involved in about 20 Wick visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did great!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, to survive. I've talked to people who had one visit and nearly had
                    nervous breakdowns. In a way, doing one is worse than doing 20, especially in
                    Paris, because the staff had the arrangements down pat. They knew exactly what
                    he wanted, what he demanded, and so we would just do it. We had a very good
                    staff that we could depend on. But the very first visit was terrifying for me
                    because it happened two weeks after I had arrived in Paris and I was acting PAO.
                    I still didn't know anything and I had to face Charlie and Mary Jane coming to
                    town. They said they didn't want a program. They were going to stay at the
                    Ambassador's residence and wanted to relax there over the week. The Ambassador
                    always charged them for their stay, as he did others, believe it or not. But
                    that is where they insisted on staying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MORAD: Evan Galbraith was a Reagan appointee. Former stockbroker who had worked
                    in France and supposedly spoke French but didn't really. As I said, Wick said
                    all he wanted was to be met at the airport, dropped off at the Ambassador's and
                    spend two quiet weekend days there and then leave. I thought, “Great, thank
                    God!” So we picked them up and took them to the Ambassador's residence. This was
                    on Saturday. But about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, I got a call from Charlie
                    Wick at home. “Mary Jane and I decided we would like to do a tour of the Louvre.
                    But don't make a big thing of it. See if you can get somebody at the Louvre to
                    give us an official tour, and don't forget about security arrangements. “What
                    time would you like to go?” I asked. “Let's say about 11 o'clock,” he said. It
                    is 9 o'clock in the morning. I am at home, it is Sunday, and he wants no special
                    treatment, only an official tour. So I said to myself: “Oh my God, what am I
                    going to do”? Fortunately we had a woman who was a contract art consultant on
                    the staff. She handled art openings liaison with the art community, that kind of
                    thing. The kind of thing no other post would need, but in Paris was important.
                    So, I got this brilliant idea. I called her at home. Maybe she could help. To my
                    relief, she said: “No problem. I'll make the arrangements and call you back.” In
                    half an hour, the whole thing was arranged. She said, “I have somebody who will
                    meet us at the side door with security and give us a private tour. I know this
                    high-level official who is happy to do it.” She also said she would accompany
                    them as well. So the whole thing comes off without a flaw, and the Wicks are
                    delighted. I didn't really do anything except call our consultant. If she hadn't
                    been there, I don't know what we would have done. That is the kind of tenor
                    Charlie Wick's reign instilled in the hearts and minds of PAOs. European PAOs
                    suffered more than anybody else, I thing, at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine it was very nice living in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Oh, it was wonderful! We had a wonderful apartment that the Deputy PAO has
                    been living in for years. Half a block from the Seine a pretty walk over to the
                    Talleyrand Building, which was magnificently restored in the 80's. FBO spent
                    millions of dollars restoring it. There were till numerous flaws in the building
                    but they were offset by its historic beauty. My office overlooked Tivoli and the
                    Place de la Concorde. It was a glorious place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you want to say about France before
                        we get on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I have one more personal thing. I won't go into all the details of this
                    because there were too many people affected, but there was another PAO during
                    the second year. It was Sam Courtney, who replaced Terry Catherman who went on
                    to Bonn as PAO. There were four senior officers at the post. Sam Courtney, who
                    was a Minister Counselor, me as Deputy PAO and a counselor, Kenton Keith, who
                    was the Cultural Attach� in a senior CAO position but who was also a Counselor
                    at the time, and Phil Brown who was the IO and also a Counselor. The PAO decided
                    that we should all write our own performance evaluations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is strange.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, and I fought with him vigorously about it and lost. I said it wasn't
                    right to do that. I was talking as his Deputy. I didn't think it was right. But
                    he said that he found that in his experience that officers could be more
                    objective about their performances than he could be. I said, “Nevertheless, I
                    don't think it is right.” But he insisted on it, and in the end I finally said:
                    “Well, if you insist on this, I am warning you now that I am going to be limited
                    only by my writing ability in terms of the wonderful things that I will say
                    about myself.” And he said, “Fine, go ahead; write whatever you want.” And so,
                    the three of us did. We all wrote magnificent OERs on ourselves. The first year
                    that I was in Paris, I spend about 75% of the time being Acting PAO because
                    Terry was away; the second year I spent about 75% of the time being unofficial
                    Acting PAO because Sam, during his first year, spent about four or six hours a
                    day in language training. So basically I was running the operation. Anyway,
                    after I left Paris and came back to Washington, performance pay awards were
                    announced. Sam Courtney got a performance pay award; Kenton Keith got a
                    performance pay award; Phil Brown got a performance pay award; Jim Morad got no
                    performance pay award. And after I wrote my own OER. Puzzling. Maybe I was more
                    modest then I realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were probably the best writer of the bunch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I couldn't believe it. In the previous year I had gotten a performance
                    award when Terry Catherman had written it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Sam sign these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, he signed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was your reviewing officer back in the Area
                        Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I don't thing we had a reviewing officer. There are other off-the-record
                    aspects of that incident that I won't go into. I just wanted to bring this up as
                    an example of the flaws and unpredictability of the personnel system in the
                    Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you know, I was 32 years as a Foreign Service Officer

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MORAD: I hadn't either. Although since then I have heard from a few people who
                    told me they were asked to write their own OERs.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not say, “Write it and I'll just sign it.”</hi>

                <p>THE ASSIGNMENTS PROCESS</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, its July of 1986 and you go back to Washington. You
                        become Chief of the European Division of the VOA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Before I left Paris, in fact a few months before, I had been called by
                    Stan Burnett who was Counselor of the Agency and had been my PAO at NATO. He
                    asked if I would be interested in the position of Associate Director of Press
                    and Publications. I said yes, I would be. It was a position that top ranking
                    Minister Counselors had normally occupied. I said that as a Counselor, I didn't
                    think was eligible for it or that I would be competitive. He said that I would
                    be and that there were two other officers who were in a position to take it. One
                    of them was Art Lewis, who was probably going to get an Ambassadorship, and the
                    other was Jim Rentschler who was also gunning for an Ambassadorship. If they got
                    the jobs they wanted, the Press and Publications job would be mine. So I said,
                    “Fine.” I was delighted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the largest divisions in the Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Exactly, and directly in my field of interest and what I considered my
                    expertise. I got a call some weeks later that the job was going to be paneled
                    and the assignment was going to be made the next day. The next day I got a call
                    from Stan who said there was a glitch. Remember him? Mike Schneider was the
                    deputy to Charles Horner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Associate Director for Policy and Progress and a
                        political appointee.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MORAD: He was a political appointee but a totally hands-off person. He didn't
                    really get involved in the operations. And apparently Mike Schneider handled
                    everything for him, including assignments in the office. So all the negotiations
                    and discussions concerning the position were between Mike and Personnel. They
                    apparently agreed on me. And then the job was to be paneled to formalize the
                    assignment. But the day before Stan Burnett, who was counselor of the Agency,
                    and Horner had to go to a meeting somewhere in Washington. They were in a car
                    together and Stan said, “Charles, you are going to get a tremendous guy in Jim
                    Morad, in the Press an Publications job.” And he said, “What, who is he? No one
                    has ever said anything to be about this.” That is how the story was told to me.
                    I wasn't there obviously. So, Horner returns to the office, consults with Mike,
                    gets angry at Mike for not having conferred with him about the assignment and
                    sees that whole thing as a Foreign Service plot to deprive him of his
                    prerogatives to assign people to key positions in his organization. So he puts a
                    hold on the assignment. But Stan called me “He isn't going to be able to find
                    anybody, and besides there is a hiring freeze in effect.” He wanted to go
                    outside the Agency, but Deputy Director Marvin Stone had put a freeze on
                    bringing people in from the outside. Stan concluded, “In the end you will get
                    the job; it's just going to take a couple more weeks.” But a couple of weeks
                    dragged into week after week, after week and still the assignment wasn't
                    confirmed. The day before I left Paris, Stan called and said, “Bad news. I'm
                    sorry, you didn't get the job.” Because of my expectations, I had stopped
                    looking and negotiating for others jobs. And so the day before I leave for
                    Washington, I have no assignment.</p>
                <p>DIRECTOR OF VOA'S EUROPEAN DIV.A “hero” in Eastern Europe</p>
                <p>MORAD: They Barry Fulton, Director of Foreign Service Personnel, started putting
                    pressure on me to take the job of Director of the European Division of the VOA.
                    The reason for that was that some time before, I had put that job down on a list
                    of jobs that were opening up at the time. You know, you list so many jobs. I
                    never really wanted the job, and I never thought that I would get it to begin
                    with. So in the end that's the job personnel zeroed in on. That's the one they
                    insisted that I take. In response, I said, “I don't want the job. If I had
                    applied for that job from the outside, you'd never accept me for it. I don't
                    have any experience in broadcasting; I don't have any experience in Eastern
                    Europe. And you are putting me in charge of an operation of ten million dollars
                    and two hundred and fifty people.” Personnel's reply was, “You can do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time wasn't there a debate about why we were
                        broadcasting in shortwave to Western Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MORAD: There really wasn't much shortwave broadcasting to Western Europe. Most
                    were placement services, or telephone correspondent reports. The Services
                    existed only in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. The real on-air shortwave
                    programming was to Eastern Europe which was the most important thing the VOA was
                    doing. And it was one of the biggest divisions in VOA. Anyway, I refused to take
                    the job. I told Barry, “I'm going home. Call me if there is another job.” and I
                    stayed home for three or four days. Then he called and said, “Will you do me a
                    favor and talk to Jodie Lewinsohn?” And I asked, “Why?” “Oh, I just want you to
                    talk to her about the job,” he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what job did she have at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MORAD: She was the Deputy Associate Director for the Educational and Cultural
                    Affairs Bureau. But it wasn't in that capacity that he wanted me to talk to her.
                    It was because she was a senior officer, and simply because she was Jodie
                    Lewinsohn. I said, “I don't see what purpose that is going to serve.” Jodie and
                    I never had a close relationship. And he said, “Well, talk to her anyway.” So I
                    agreed. I went to see her and she told me, “Take the job.” You are going to
                    break all this china and hurt yourself and your prospects if you refuse to take
                    it. Take the job for three months, and if you don't like it, start negotiating
                    your way out of it and nobody will hold it against you. But if you refuse to
                    take it now, you are going to develop permanent animosities around here.” I
                    don't know why they were placing so much importance on this assignment. Of
                    course I was still angry because I didn't get the Press and Publications job.
                    That was part of the reason for my refusal. But, I said “Ok, that's good advice,
                    that's what I'll do.” I fully planned to negotiate my way out of the job as soon
                    as possible. Well, I get there and, much to my surprise, I really liked the job.
                    It really turned out to be interesting, and I had my own domain there. I mean I
                    was king of a domain of 250 people. And it turned out to be politically and
                    managerially a fascinating experience. But I still expected it to be the end of
                    the line for me because I was in the last year of a time-in-class extension as
                    Counselor during my first year at VOA. The promotion panel that met that year
                    would determine whether I received either a promotion, which I thought was
                    impossible or another three-year extension. I had already two extensions and was
                    fully expecting to pack my bags. Also, I assumed the GS employees at VOA had no
                    idea how to write a Foreign Service OER to impress a promotion panel. But there
                    were a number of FSOs there, more than there are now. Most of those FSO
                    positions have since been eliminated. There were three of us for whom 1987 was
                    crucial for different reasons. So we all met with Al Heil, who was our rating
                    officer. He was the Deputy Director of the Program Division, and we told him how
                    important it was to say, whatever he wanted to say, but to write the OER in a
                    way that was meaningful to the promotion panel. Al got the message and wrote the
                    best, in the sense of the most effective, OER that I've ever received. He was a
                    professional radio writer and had been around VOA for years. He is Mr. VOA and
                    knows all sides of the domestic and foreign service. Plus he possesses great
                    writing ability. I mean he wrote an OER that came alive. Miraculously, I got a
                    promotion to Minister Counselor, something I never expected and probably didn't
                    deserve, at least in terms of major assignments. The whole process is so
                    unpredictable and subjective. You can get fired when you don't deserve it, and
                    you can get promoted when you don't necessarily deserve it. The VOA turned out
                    to be a great experience. I began to appreciate the VOA's importance for the
                    first time. I went to Eastern Europe, my first exposure to Eastern Europe, and
                    visited all of the countries in the region except Czechoslovakia, which wouldn't
                    give me a visa. I found that as VOA representative I was a hero. I mean
                    literally a hero among communists government officials as well as ordinary
                    citizens, nearly all who listen every day to find out what was going on in their
                    own countries and in the world. It was an amazing situation that really opened
                    my eyes to what happened two year later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, and its so well recognized now. The importance of
                        VOA to what happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MORAD: Yes, exactly. I never had that much regard for VOA, but I certainly did in
                    the Eastern Europe context working with it and being on the receiving end of
                    hero worship over there. The trip also made me realize that those countries had
                    closer relationships, more interests, more in common with the United States than
                    they did with each other. They had either disdain or ignorance for each other,
                    despite presumably being members of the Communist Bloc. Unity was a myth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same thing used to be true with Latin America,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Sure. That is definitely true in Latin America, but here we are talking
                    about the so-called Communist Bloc, which was no bloc at all. And of course,
                    they were all equally hostile toward the Soviet Union which was the real enemy
                    to them. I used to say, I never in all my years in Western Europe had seen so
                    much open appreciation and admiration for the United States and these are people
                    we have our nuclear weapons targeted on. Another example of the irony of foreign
                    policy and world politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there for two years, enjoyed it, and
                        learned a lot and were promoted. They you went from there to be a Senior
                        Inspector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: Yes. I became a Senior Inspector. I wanted to go back overseas, but I
                    still had family reasons for not doing so. Two teenage daughters and an aging
                    mother, posed all kinds of difficulties for me in leaving. Also, there was only
                    one assignment at the Minister Counselor level, which interested me, and it was
                    in Turkey. They couldn't fill it at the time, for some reason. Dell Pendergrast,
                    who was the Deputy in EU, and who I had served with in Brussels asked me to take
                    the job. I couldn't decide but he kept calling and I finally agreed to take it.
                    I went into Turkish language training at FSI for three months, which was a very
                    difficult experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That language is difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MORAD: Very difficult. It was the first non-romance language that I had studied,
                    and of course, it had no relationship to anything that I knew, so I had a hard
                    time. The further I got into it and the closer to departure date, I said, “How
                    am I going to do this, leave my family behind, wife, two daughters, a mother who
                    was in decline of health in California.” I asked myself, “Do I really need this
                    at this stage in life?” I said, “Christ, I can't do it.” And so I went to Harlan
                    Rosacker, Director of Personnel, fully expecting to give an ultimatum: Either
                    take the job or resign. And I would have resigned if he gave me an ultimatum.
                    But he said, “Maybe you are no longer in a position to be in the Foreign
                    Service, if you can't take this job.” And I said, “Well, you may be right. But I
                    would like to postpone the decision for at least two years, and if you give me
                    two years, there is a 99% chance that I'll retire at that time. And if not, I'll
                    probably be at the end of my MC five-year-time-in-class, anyway, and you can
                    retire me.” Surprisingly he said OK. He didn't given me a hard time about it at
                    all. And then, unlike three months earlier, there was a huge interest in the
                    job. It became very competitive with a lot of officers bidding for it. I became
                    a Senior Inspector for two years.</p>
                <p>THE INSPECTION CORPS &amp; BOOK PROGRAMS</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a Senior Inspector, where were your inspections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I was part of the inspection team in Brazil on my first inspection and
                    later headed inspection teams to Indonesia and the Soviet Union. I also headed
                    the inspection of Libraries, the Amparts program and the Fast-Media Guidance
                    Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then your final assignment was as Chief of the Book
                        Program Division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It was a job that was far below my level, but at the point the handwriting
                    was on the wall and I didn't want to spend more than two years on the Inspection
                    Staff. There were difficult internal circumstances in that office and I wanted
                    to leave. I had always been interested in the book program since my early days
                    in the Agency, both in Spain and particularly in Brazil where the book program
                    was in full operation when I arrived. It was a huge program then and was given a
                    lot of importance. I've always been interested in publishing and the business
                    side of publishing, so I took the job and was not disappointed. I found it very
                    interesting and got to do quite a bit of interesting travel, including attending
                    the American Book Seller's annual conventions, which are huge extravaganzas. One
                    of the things I liked about the job was that again, I had my own staff and
                    budget and basically was out of the Agency mainstream. Not that many people in
                    the Agency were interested in the Book Program, so I had a lot of
                    independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't you at that time building up the programs for
                        Eastern Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>MORAD: We were. We received a tremendous amount of money for Eastern Europe and
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>ANOTHER LIBRARY STUDY</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me anything about the time you were chairman
                        of a library task force?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MORAD: Barry Fulton, who by then was the Deputy Associate Director of the Bureau
                    of Educational and Cultural Affairs, of which the libraries were a division,
                    asked me if I would head a task force to study libraries and make practical
                    recommendations for improving their management, administration, and cost
                    effectiveness. He didn't want radical recommendations for closing down
                    libraries, and he didn't want a pie-in-the-sky report. All the recommendations
                    had to assume that there would be no additional funding available for the
                    libraries. So, in a very practical way, I told him I didn't want to do it
                    because I had done a little bit of research and there were something like 17 or
                    19 library studies conducted over the years and most of them were shelved
                    without any implementation at all. Some had bits and pieces of recommendations
                    implemented at most. I really didn't want to be associated with it because I
                    didn't see it going anywhere. On top of that, I was no library expert. I was one
                    of those FSOs who almost never stepped into an Agency library myself, although I
                    did do a limited inspection on library and policy while I was on the OIG staff.
                    But Barry convinced me; he said that this study was going to be implemented. He
                    said that if he agreed with the recommendations and it was done well, the report
                    would be implemented and he would make sure of that, given his position as
                    Deputy Associate Director. So, I did agree to do it, but then we had a very
                    difficult time getting it started. We didn't have the resources, we didn't have
                    the personnel. The only person who was supposed to be the real library expert on
                    the task force turned out to be unreliable. After about two months, I told
                    Barry, “Look, I need help. I want to get off of this study and cancel it or I
                    need some bodies who can perform. I gave him a few names and he agreed to them.
                    They we got started in earnest and it worked out very well. I thing we produced
                    the most comprehensive study of the libraries that has every been done in the
                    Agency. There were recommendations for improvements in many areas, but the most
                    valuable parts of the report were, in the Appendix. We had separate chapters in
                    the Appendix, one of which showed what kind of library was appropriate for each
                    type of host country. We had a matrix that related country characteristics and
                    resources to the kind of library that should serve it. They ranged from a
                    reading room and an electronic reference center with on-line, database
                    capabilities in the information section to major open libraries. We also had an
                    incredibly well-done chapter on the technology of libraries today, which was
                    done by a library technology specialist. It was all in there, but unfortunately,
                    as we were moving along with the study, which took about six months to complete,
                    Congress was developing proposals to close down all European libraries and the
                    libraries in all of the OECD countries, which included Australia, New Zealand
                    and Canada, on grounds that they were friendly countries and there was no
                    justification for spending tax payer's money to provide library services to
                    affluent people who could easily afford them. The reason for dumping their
                    libraries was that a congressman was looking for $30 million to fund a nuclear
                    energy project in a former Soviet republic and had his staff go through the
                    federal budget to find out where they could find the money. They stumbled on the
                    Agency's library budget and discovered that the cost of running the OECD
                    libraries was about $10 million. The Congressman and staff saw this as an easy
                    target that would have little political support. So they proposed cutting
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incredible!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MORAD: That's how it got started. The Agency handled the hearings and the
                    negotiations with the Hill very badly, but finally it got a delay in
                    implementation and the Agency promised to do a study and come up with some other
                    recommendations. People thought that our library study was the response to this,
                    which it was not. It preceded the Congressional proposal and was done for a
                    separate purpose. But the whole issue with Congress came to a head at the same
                    time our library study was completed and when the Agency was changing
                    leadership. The new Agency leadership decided to put a hold on the library
                    report until it had a chance to study it and to await the outcome of
                    negotiations with Congress on the OECD libraries. That is where it stood when I
                    retired.</p>
                <p>Well, since then the Agency has gone through a major reorganization, and the
                    library division was transferred to the new Information Bureau. As I understand
                    it, the Library Division itself may be dismantled or significantly reduced, and
                    the relationship to the overseas libraries changed as a result. I am not sure to
                    what extent our library study's recommendations are relevant anymore, given the
                    change that has taken place. That is probably why you haven't heard of it or it
                    has not been published. And so my original prediction or concern about taking
                    the job, of course, was justified. The library study is gathering dust on the
                    shelves along with all of its predecessors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well just a few more things and then we will wind this up.
                        How do you see the overall role of the USIA? Is it a major influence or is
                        it one of a number of support elements for pursuing U.S. foreign policy
                        objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FINAL THOUGHTS</p>
                <p>MORAD: I thing USIA is, basically, a support element. I think we liked to see
                    ourselves as a live function over the years, in many ways almost competing with
                    State Department and traditional diplomacy for achieving foreign policy
                    objectives. I think that has always been a pipe dream and never been accepted by
                    anybody except misguided USIS Foreign Service Officers who needed to think they
                    were more important and what they were doing was more important than in reality
                    it was. I think cultural and information programs are essentially components of
                    support for our traditional diplomatic efforts. I don't think they stand alone
                    or are separate or independent from traditional diplomacy. I have always seen
                    USIA in a subordinate position to the State Department, unlike some Agency
                    officers. I think that with the end of the cold war the Agency in one form or
                    another will be dismantled, that some of its component parts will be absorbed
                    into the State Department and maybe others by other Government agencies. People
                    have been saying that for years and it has never happened. It is very difficult
                    to dismantle a government bureaucracy. I was prepared to accept USIA's
                    dismantling, in fact supported the idea in the late 70s when reorganization of
                    USIA was being debated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the Stanton Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: It was the Stanton Commission, which in the end did not make the
                    recommendation; there was little support for absorbing the Agency's functions
                    into the State Department. My theory, which turned out to be partly true, is
                    that the Agency was so small and insignificant that it would never enjoy much
                    political support in Washington and would become vulnerable to political
                    manipulation and to the appointment of political hacks to key positions. In my
                    view, that is exactly what happened during the Reagan Administration. I
                    understand that political appointees are a natural part of the political process
                    in Washington, but I think the Reagan appointees were more ideological and
                    militant and intent on churning and revolutionizing agency operations. They were
                    also more suspicious of and hostile to career employees. I don't remember
                    attitudes like that among previous appointees. I think that also began a more
                    serious politicalization of the Agency than we had ever experienced before. We
                    are still going through that process even today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other comments before we end this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORAD: I appreciate getting all these stream of consciousness thoughts registered
                    on your tape recorder. I guess maybe I'll close by saying that despite the fact
                    that I've been somewhat of a discontent with the Agency—over the years I have
                    not always felt comfortable either with my role or the Agency's—looking back on
                    it my career has been largely more satisfying and rewarding financially and in
                    terms of experiences than I expected my career as a journalist to be. It also
                    enabled me to tell my mother, if she were still living, that I proved her wrong.
                    When I was a kid she would always say that I would never be able to hold down a
                    job. I can say now, “Look Mom, I held a job for 33 years.”</p>
                <p>Lots of different jobs. And one reason I think I was able to do that is exactly
                    the point that you made. In the Foreign Service we had a single umbrella
                    organization, but within it there is built-in regular change. Every two, three
                    or four years we are working in a different job, with a different cast of
                    characters in a different place for the most part. So we have change, built-in
                    change within a stable structure, and I think that is very advantageous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And variety is the spice of life!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MORAD: I agree. For somebody like me who has an impatient nature, if I had held
                    as many jobs as I have had in the Agency I would have been a real itinerant and
                    probably have no financial or seniority stake built up in any of them. But
                    within the Foreign Service, we are able to experience change and have a stable
                    career structure at the same time. I will close by saying it reminds me of the
                    time when we were in the building at 776 Pennsylvania Avenue. I was part of a
                    car pool of Foreign Service Officers driving in from Reston. One day after work
                    we were waiting for our car in the garage and there were three or four GS
                    employees also waiting for their car. They were all in a very festive mood. It
                    looked as though they had all been drinking and partying. We asked them what the
                    occasion was and they said, “We are celebrating the 18th anniversary of our car
                    pool together.” The four of us looked at each other and thought, “Oh, my
                    God!”</p>
