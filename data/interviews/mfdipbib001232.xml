                <p>AMBASSADOR GEORGE F. WARD, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 23, 2001</p>

                <p>Q: Today is April 23, 2001. This is an interview with George F. Ward, Jr. This is
                    being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and
                    I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by George?</p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning. Tell me when and where you
                        werborn and something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was born on April 9, 1945 in Jamaica, in the borough of Queens in New
                    York City. My father was an accountant and my mother was a homemaker and also
                    employed as a church secretary for most of my childhood. We lived in a
                    neighborhood of duplex houses, which in New York City were called
                    “semi-attached.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the background of your father? Where did they come
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My dad, George F. Ward, was born in Birmingham, England, on May 20, 1907.
                    He completed his schooling in England, graduating from the Aston Commercial
                    School, which gave him the equivalent of high school. His father, Frank Ward,
                    had served in the British army in World War I and after demobilization could not
                    find work in his trade as a silver and goldsmith. His father emigrated in 1921
                    to seek better fortune in the U.S., and the rest of the family, including my
                    dad, followed the next year. Several members of my father's extended family,
                    i.e., aunts, uncles, etc., also emigrated to the U.S. during the same
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your grandfather do when he came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WARD: Initially, he worked as a silver and goldsmith in the jewelry trade in New
                    York City. Family legenI have no idea if it is truhas it that he made the medal
                    presented to Charles Lindbergh after the latter's transatlantic flight. He did
                    not earn very much, however, and his children, including my father, all worked
                    from a very young age. The family situation became worse when my grandfather
                    decided, exactly when I am not sure, that he would stop working and let the
                    other members of the family support him. When that support did not materialize,
                    he left New York City and moved upstate to a rural area across the Hudson River
                    from Bear Mountain, where he built himself a cabin, lived off the land and
                    occasionally worked odd jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Grandmother Ward, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was a Grandmother Ward, and she had much more good sense than my
                    grandfather. My grandmother, Mary Ward, got a legal separation from my
                    grandfather and stayed in New York City with her two spinster daughters. Grandma
                    Ward lived to the ripe age of 96. Her two daughters are still living. They are
                    in Putnam Valley, New York, where they tutor schoolchildren, volunteer for their
                    church, and bowl in a league, all at over 90 years of age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your father stay in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My dad worked virtually from the time he immigrated until a late
                    retirement. Early on, he worked as a bookkeeper. He trained on the job as an
                    accountant, but could never afford to take the low-paying jobs that would have
                    qualified him to become a C.P.A. For a long while, he was the accountant for the
                    interior-decorating firm utilized by Marjorie Merriweather Post. For a while,
                    the china in our home consisted of the rejects from the sets made for the Sea
                    Cloud, the three-masted sailing yacht that belonged to Mrs. Post. That ship is
                    still in service as a luxury cruise ship in the Mediterranean. Dad later became
                    the trust accountant for the estate of Walter B. Chrysler, the automobile
                    manufacturer. My dad loved camping and the outdoors and eventually built a
                    weekend house in Putnam Valley, New York. In the late '60s, he left New York
                    City, moved up to Putnam Valley, and worked as an administrator for the county.
                    My dad was extremely proud that he worked for his entire life, and especially
                    that he managed to stay employed throughout the Great Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WARD: My mother, Hildegard Ward, had an interesting background. She was born on
                    May 19, 1906 in New York City. Her mother, Lina Laerm, emigrated from a small
                    farming town near Halle, Germany in 1902. (I had the opportunity to visit that
                    town, Koesseln, when the Berlin Wall came down.) She was the youngest of 13
                    children. She came to New York and fell in love with a Japanese immigrant, Teddo
                    Shimizu, who apparently had run away from his very prominent family in Japan.
                    They got married and stayed together for around 10 years. Both worked as
                    household domestics. Around 1914 or 1915, it seems that my grandfather's family
                    located him and persuaded him to return to Japan. He was never heard of again.
                    My grandmother later married a Scotsman, John Evans, whom I knew as my
                    grandfather. In fact, I did not know the story of my mother's birth father until
                    I became an adult. My mother never spoke of her Japanese heritage. I think I can
                    understand that in view of the stress she must have felt during those times,
                    when children of mixed race were regarded very differently than today, and
                    especially as an American of German-Japanese ancestry during World War II. Her
                    lot was not an easy one. She spoke German until World War I, when the other
                    children in school picked on those who spoke German. She never spoke German
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My mother had the same problem in World War I. She would
                        say, “What clock is it” and things like that. Unfortunately, then the
                        language did not pass on, so I had to learn it on my own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I did the same thing. I had to learn German on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She grew up where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My mother had a very hard childhood, since her father left the family. They
                    were very poor, way below what we think of as poor today. They had virtually
                    nothing. She left regular school after the eighth grade and finished her high
                    school at night while working as a bookkeeper during the day. She did well in
                    her jobs and worked for quite a while, probably from 1920 or 1921 until after
                    she married in 1930. She worked for various small businesses in New York. She
                    lived initially on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and then in Brooklyn. Her
                    mother eventually became the governess for the children of Colonel Jacob Rupert,
                    who owned the New York Yankees and a large brewery. Rupert was a very good to my
                    grandmother and gave her a house in Forest Hills in Queens. She moved out there
                    and tended her rose garden. I remember that house, which later was torn down to
                    make way for the construction of a large apartment house complex. My grandmother
                    then moved further out in Queens, close to where my family then lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WARD: My mother caught my father's eye while they were in the subway. In terms of
                    temperament, they were almost polar opposites. My father was an extrovert and my
                    mother an introvert. At first, she didn't want to have anything to do with this
                    red-haired guy from England - my father had flaming red hair when he was young -
                    and tried to avoid him, but he persisted, and they were married in 1930.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I had two sisters, Barbara and Eleanor; they were ten antwelve years older
                    than me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a really late child, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My mother was 39 when I was born in 1945. My eldest sister,Eleanor, died in
                    1985. My other sister, Barbara, lives in Florida.</p>
                <p>Q: You were born in 1945 in New York. You were born just about the time the war
                    in Germany ended. Where did you start going to elementary school?</p>
                <p>WARD: For the first six grades, I went to Public School 131 in Jamaica, New York.
                    It was a good public school. Most of the children in that school came from a
                    relatively upscale area known as Jamaica Estates. Later, I became part of the
                    first class in a new junior high school, Van Wyck Junior High School, #217. We
                    didn't have junior high schools in New York City until the '50s. I was part of
                    an experimental program that compressed grades seven through nine into two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall in junior high any teachers that
                        particularly sticin your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My French teacher, Mr. Greenberg, and my science teacher, Mr. Littman,
                    stand out. After junior high school, I went to the Bronx High School of Science,
                    which was a long commute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a major high school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Q: You must have been quite good in your studies.</p>
                <p>WARD: I did well, but the Bronx High School of Science was probably the most
                    academically competitive place I have ever experienced. It was extremely
                    rigorous.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself up against the Jewish mafia? In the New York area, there
                    is a large group of Jewish people who really emphasize education. The equivalent
                    now is the Chinese mafia at the University of California.</p>
                <p>WARD: People joke that the Bronx High School of Science was founded by a group of
                    Jewish mothers who lived in the Grand Concourse area of the Bronx and wanted
                    their sons to be doctors. I was the only non-Jewish pupil in my homeroom class
                    at Bronx Science, which made it interesting on Jewish holidays. It was an
                    intensely competitive academic experience. I had to commute three hours a day by
                    bus and subway to get there. I had grown up in Jamaica, which despite the fact
                    that it's part of New York City, was actually a relatively small community. I
                    went to school with the same group of kids right through ninth grade and then
                    was suddenly thrust into a different world. I had to commute through three
                    boroughs to get to school. I realized after the first day that I might have made
                    a big mistake, but I was too stubborn to quit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What inspired you to apply there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: In 1956, the Russians put Sputnik up. I was very interested in science. I
                    always did science projects and got good grades in science and read a lot about
                    scientific subjects. So, the Sputnik caused teachers and school administrators
                    to try to orient anyone who had the least aptitude in science towards science.
                    Since I had some aptitude and was interested, I ended up on that track. I had a
                    number of very talented science teachers in junior high school and in high
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you specialize in any particular field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: At Bronx Science, one had to. You could choose among biology, physics, or
                    chemistry. I chose biology. That meant that by the time my senior year rolled
                    around, I was taking college level courses in biology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this pretty much people who were looking to be
                        doctors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, to some extent. We're about to have the 40th reunion of my high school
                    class. There are a number of doctors, but not an overwhelming number. We turned
                    out to be a pretty diverse group; the common factor seems to be a large number
                    of advanced degrees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, what would a biology major be looking
                        towards doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WARD: Most of the biology majors at Bronx High School of Science were looking to
                    become doctors. I was not because four years of undergraduate college was a
                    large enough financial challenge for my family. I didn't have the slightest idea
                    of how I could possibly afford eight years of university education after high
                    school, so medicine was never a serious consideration for me. It was just
                    economically impossible. Even to become a research biologist one needed a Ph.D.
                    Again, that was financially impossible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have summer jobs? I imagine commuting would take
                        care oyou during high school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I didn't have any jobs during the school year, but during the summer, I
                    did. A neighbor of mine in Queens had a stationery business in Manhattan and I
                    worked as a delivery boy for him, running things around the subways and bus
                    lines and walking around lower Manhattan. I got to know Manhattan very well. I
                    also worked as an office boy in a law firm for one summer before I went to
                    college.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to pick up on the theme of history, while you were on
                        thscience track, what sort of reading were you doing in history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I read an awful lot when I was a kid. I read American history extensively.
                    When I was about eight or nine, my mother gave me a subscription to American
                    Heritage magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've read every issue since 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I never got the first issue, but I still have the second one. Actually,
                    although it's written in a popular style, it is an excellent survey of American
                    history. If all the issues were indexed on CD-ROM, that would be useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is first rate. I've religiously read every
                        issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I stopped years ago just because of lack of time, but when I was a kid, I
                    read it religiously. American history was my favorite, but I was also interested
                    in European history. At the same time, I was also attracted to science. Aside
                    from biology, I had thought of aerospace engineering. When I applied to college,
                    I did so as a biology major.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated at 16. What year was that? What did you do
                        aboucollege?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WARD: I graduated high school in 1961. One of my sisters had gone to college, but
                    that was years before, and I had very little guidance on where to go. I
                    understand that today high school students apply to eight or 10 colleges. At
                    Bronx Science, we were limited to three applications. The teachers would only
                    write three recommendations. I applied to Harvard and the University of
                    Rochester. At the time, one of my sisters lived in Rochester, and I went up
                    there and visited the school and liked it a lot. I also applied to a small
                    school in Ohio as a backup. Harvard had a quota for the Bronx High School of
                    Science - they would only accept four. The average SAT score of the 80 or so who
                    applied to Harvard from Bronx Science was about 1450. I was not one of those
                    accepted at Harvard, so I chose Rochester.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there for four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I did, '61-'65. It turned out to be a very happy choice. That sometimes
                    happens when you fall into things. I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted
                    to get a Navy ROTC scholarship. Although my parents were quite willing to pay
                    the cost of a private education, it would have been through very significant
                    financial sacrifice for them. My mother probably would have had to take a second
                    job. As a freshman, however, I was too young for a Navy ROTC scholarship. You
                    had to be 17, and I was only 16. So, I sort of sat out a year as what is known
                    as a “contract NROTC student” and then competed for an appointment to a regular
                    NROTC scholarship, which covered all of my tuition and books and paid $50 a
                    month. That relieved a great deal of the financial pressure on my family. I
                    didn't have to take out huge student loans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the University of Rochester like in that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The University of Rochester was, and still is as far as I can tell, an
                    institution with a real commitment to undergraduate education. For example, we
                    had a program called the Honors Program that was an option for juniors and
                    seniors. In the Honors Program, the course load was limited to two per semester,
                    but these were seminars with no more than eight people in them, taught often in
                    the professors' homes. There were no tests during the semester. We were required
                    to read extensively and to write one paper a week for each seminar. At the end
                    of the year, the university would bring in outside examiners for written and
                    oral examinations. I participated in seminars on American intellectual history,
                    Marxism, the Renaissance, the American legislative system, 18th century Europe,
                    and others. Each was a unique and interesting experience. The constant writing
                    was excellent career preparation. By the way, I had changed my major from
                    biology to political science before matriculation. Then I changed it again in my
                    freshman year to history. I just liked history more. I decided I would study
                    what I was really interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought about this earth change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WARD: It was somewhat a matter of faith, the feeling that my calling was not in
                    the field of biology. I was doing well in biology, but that's not where I felt
                    called to spend my life. I was fascinated by politics and history - how
                    political systems worked, how they didn't work, how leaders lead, how great
                    decisions got made. So, I made the change.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there from '61-'65. The arrival of John F. Kennedy caused quite a
                    change. It was a call of people working for the country. Did that hit Rochester
                    or you?</p>
                <p>WARD: I think it did. Kennedy was such a powerful influence on the whole
                    generation. I think many young people took to heart his call to service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In political science and history, were there any areas
                        that yowere specializing in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was interesting. I didn't specialize in anything that had to do with
                    international relations. I never took a course with “international” in its title
                    until I got to graduate school many years later. I focused on American history.
                    That was a field I loved. I read both American literature and American history
                    voraciously, soaked it up. It was wonderful training for the mind and was
                    terribly impractical in terms of career.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the times? You were there. The Cold War was going. Vietnam was
                    beginning to heat up. Did this impact much on where you were?</p>
                <p>WARD: It began to. Rochester was a school that sent freedom riders to the South
                    in 1964. It was a school where by the time I was graduating, anti-war protests
                    were beginning. It was a school where the appeal of the NROTC faded over time
                    and almost everyone in NROTC who was not on a scholarship dropped out, taking
                    the size of our unit down from around 150 to 85 or so. However, politics were
                    less a part of daily life at Rochester than they had been at Bronx Science,
                    where there was an active radical left fringe - communists and Trotskyites. The
                    antics of the left at Bronx Science made me into a conservative. At Rochester,
                    however, I wasn't active politically. I studied hard and made Phi Beta Kappa. I
                    started running track, the mile and half mile. Commuting three hours a day in
                    high school had left no time for organized sports, and I really disliked that. I
                    managed to letter in track, but I think the coach gave more credit to my
                    enthusiasm than my ability. I was active in the NROTC, and that took a great
                    deal of time, because the required naval science courses had to be taken as
                    overloads.</p>

                        tendeto be European socialist and Trotskyite and very committed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes. The fathers and mothers of these kids were active politically and
                    had come out of a Central or Eastern European environment. It seemed as if
                    everyone I knew came from families that had immigrated relatively recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rochester is a community. One thinks of the Eastman School
                        anKodak. Did you get any chance to taste Rochester as a community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I did. Thirty to forty percent of the students were from the Rochester
                    area, so you got to know their families and the town. It was a nice town.
                    Immediately after I left, they had some real difficulties - race riots and such.
                    But it was a very hospitable community during the time I was there. We now think
                    of Rochester as not quite the rust belt, but not on the leading edge of
                    technology either. But at the time, Rochester was a high-tech place. It was
                    where Kodak and Xerox were based. There were a lot of German and other European
                    immigrant families there, and they gave Rochester a significant base of skilled
                    labor. Apart from Kodak and Xerox, there were places like the Gleason Works and
                    Bausch and Lomb that depended upon skilled artisans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, Rochester must have been nice because it's noted for
                        itmild winters, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Right. The winters were really cold and snowy. There were tunnels under the
                    campus to help you get around. Strangely enough, however, I can't remember that
                    the weather was ever a real inconvenience. After a Rochester winter, though,
                    spring was quite wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an ROTC person, you knew what you were going to be
                        doing wheyou graduated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I chose the Marine option in NROTC early on, so I waheaded toward the
                    Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WARD: There were two reasons. The most important was that the Marine
                    officer-instructor at the NROTC unit was an outstanding man whom I came to look
                    upon as my second father. His name was Victor Ohanesian. He was an outstanding
                    leader and a person of high intellect. He had completed all the coursework for a
                    Ph.D. in Chinese studies; he was a former semi-pro football player; he had been
                    an enlisted Marine in World War II and a junior infantry officer in Korea.
                    Unfortunately, he was later killed in Vietnam as a battalion commander. His
                    command group was ambushed near the DMZ, and he insisted that his people get on
                    the medevac chopper first. He bled to death. He died a hero, and those of us who
                    knew him will never forget him. The second reason for choosing the Marines was
                    that I could not imagine spending a career at sea. As part of the NROTC program,
                    we were required as midshipmen to go on summer “cruises.” The first summer was
                    10 weeks at sea, which I spent on an aircraft carrier and a destroyer. Being on
                    an aircraft city was like living in a floating city. I decided that the Marines
                    offered much greater adventure, and that I was in it for adventure and not for
                    driving a boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated in '65. You were in the Marine Corps for
                        holong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was on active duty for four years, '65-'69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you first came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The first thing I did was get married - six days after graduated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I met my future wife at church in Jamaica, New York. I grew up in a
                    close-knit community that was based around a little Methodist church in Jamaica.
                    Once we were in college, members of our youth group would get together at
                    Christmas break. In December 1963, we went as a group to sing Christmas carols
                    at an old-age home in Brooklyn. Now my wife had not been part of that group of
                    friends. Her father had spent a career in the Air Force. She had been born in
                    Jamaica, New York, but her parents moved away when she was an infant and came
                    back only when she was 18. She came Christmas caroling with us, and we fell in
                    love on first sight. We were married in June 1965, when we were both 20. I
                    needed my parents' permission to get married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WARD: Then, as every Marine officer does, I went to the Marine Officers Basic
                    School. I spent six months at Quantico, Virginia learning how to lead an
                    infantry platoon. I was there from June to December 1965. After Basic School,
                    where I did well, I was headed toward the infantry when I decided that I would
                    rather specialize in the control of close air support. That specialty turned out
                    to be a disappointment, because it was not the sort of frontline type job that
                    it had been advertised as.</p>
                <p>This intersects with my interest in the Foreign Service. I hadn't heard about the
                    Foreign Service until my senior year in college when a friend of mine, Dick
                    English - who has disappeared into the mists of time - told me that he was going
                    to take the Foreign Service exam. I said, “What's that?” He said, “Well, you get
                    to work in embassies overseas.” I said, “That sounds like fun.” So, I registered
                    for the Foreign Service exam. While I was a second lieutenant at Basic School, I
                    came up to Washington to one of the high schools to take the Foreign Service
                    exam. The building was packed with people, all of whom seemed to know a lot more
                    about the Foreign Service than I did because they had attended Georgetown or
                    similar programs. I had no clue about the Foreign Service. I had never taken a
                    course on international relations. In a political science seminar, I had done a
                    paper on the Foreign Assistance Act, but that was the extent of my knowledge of
                    the foreign affairs community. In any case, I passed the written exam and took
                    the oral in early 1966. When I took the oral, the examiners did an unusual
                    thing. I was by then stationed in North Carolina. I drove up to Washington with
                    my wife. They invited my wife into the exam room and quizzed her. It wasn't just
                    “Hello, how are you?” They asked her about all sorts of aspects of Foreign
                    Service life. She probably knew less about the Foreign Service than I did, but
                    she did a great job with their questions. Then she sat outside while I took the
                    exam. In the exam, they asked what I was going to do in the Marine Corps. I told
                    them about my assignment in close air support. They said, “It would be great if
                    you could get into intelligence. That would be relevant to the Foreign
                    Service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes. I realized before the exam that I knew nothing about the Foreign
                    Service. I tried to read periodicals like Foreign Affairs, but they were hard to
                    come by on my Marine Corps base. The only relevant book in the Post Library at
                    the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, North Carolina was about the
                    British Foreign Service, so I checked that out and read it. I couldn't find
                    anything on the American Foreign Service. I came up to Washington for the exam.
                    It was the old style exam that was supposed to put pressure on the applicant,
                    with the examiners sitting some distance away and the applicant alone behind a
                    table. There was a large map of the world off on the left-hand side of the room.
                    One question was, “Starting at the left side of the map and proceeding toward
                    the right, where do you think there will be troubles in the world over the next
                    15 years?” That was a very open-ended question, and an easy one because you
                    could sort of pick whatever topic you wanted. There were plenty of potential
                    trouble spots. They asked a lot of questions about the Foreign Service, which I
                    really knew nothing about. There were also questions like, “Do you really want
                    to live overseas? Do you really want this kind of life” and that sort of thing.
                    I thought the questions were so hard that, by the end of the exam, I knew I had
                    failed. So, I was very surprised when I didn't. As I left, they congratulated me
                    on knowing so much about the Foreign Service. That little book on the British
                    Foreign Service had served me well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learned to fake it then, which I'm sure served you
                        well lateon. What happened when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I passed all the medical and security clearances by the summer of 1966. At
                    the time, the Department would hold an appointment offer open for three years if
                    you were a military officer. Candidates who were enlisted did not have that
                    advantage. That was discrimination. In the meantime, I did get into intelligence
                    by being selected to attend the Army counterintelligence officer course. At the
                    time, intelligence in the Marine Corps had a secondary status. Regular officers
                    could hold an intelligence qualification only as a secondary specialty. Only
                    warrant officers, reserve officers, and limited-duty officers could be primary
                    intelligence specialists. I became the first regular Marine officer to attend
                    the counterintelligence course. Today, the intelligence field is much more
                    important in the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they can get the intelligence officers out of
                        thuniversities as they come out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: So I did get an intelligence specialty. I went to the Army
                    Counterintelligence Course at Fort Holabird in Baltimore and learned how to
                    follow spies around Germany. My wife was then pregnant with our first and only
                    child. I then went back to North Carolina. Our daughter, Pamela Elizabeth, was
                    born on September 13th, and in November 1967 I shipped out for Vietnam, where
                    the techniques I had learned to uncover spies in Germany were not all that
                    helpful. After a short time doing close air support in Vietnam, I was
                    transferred from the First Marine Aircraft Wing to the First Marine Division in
                    order to do counterintelligence work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: I got there in November 1967 and left in December 1968. I was first based
                    in Chu Lai, where we had a direct air support center that later deployed to Khe
                    Sanh. Chu Lai is in a beautiful location, and life there was pretty good until
                    Tet 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chu Lai is located where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: South of Da Nang on the coast. The First Marine Division was there until
                    mid-1967. One of the early large engagements in the war was fought on a
                    peninsula near Chu Lai. Later, the First Marine Division moved north and was
                    replaced by the Army's Americal Division, which, in my opinion, did not do
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were involved in My Lai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My Lai was not far from Chu Lai. I did not have great regard for the
                    military performance of the Americal Division. They did not do enough patrolling
                    and spent too much time hunkered down behind barbed wire. As a Marine unit, we
                    maintained our own perimeter. Even before Tet, we had begun to get mortared and
                    rocketed a couple of nights each week. Then during Tet we actually had ground
                    action against our perimeter. That became fairly chaotic because an Army unit
                    began firing through our positions. After Tet, I was able to get reassigned to
                    the First Marine Division, which is where I wanted to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find... At your level-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was a captain. Promotions were very quick. I got promoteto captain with
                    less than two years service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ready for the Tet offensive? Was it a shock?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WARD: It was a shock, although we expected that the cease-fire would be violated.
                    All holiday cease-fires were violated. I don't think anyone expected that we
                    were going to see the scale of action that took place. The dominant impression
                    of Tet as an American military defeat is totally incorrect. There were some
                    places, such as Hue, where we did retreat at the beginning. But by March 1968,
                    it was clear that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had suffered an
                    overwhelming military defeat. We ceased to see any activity in the I Corps area
                    by South Vietnamese guerrilla forces. The North Vietnamese took over all of the
                    fighting.Before Tet, my Marine air support unit had detachments spread out all
                    the way from the North Vietnamese border south to Chu Lai. Getting back and
                    forth between these detachments and especially up to Khe Sanh became
                    problematical. Our people up in Khe Sanh were really cut off. They were isolated
                    for about two months. Marines there lived a bunker life. Our unit was
                    controlling close air support right outside the wire of the base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of the recapture of old Hue as being a big Marine
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was. The recapture of Hue was completed by the end of February: I joined
                    the Division in May 1968. The Fifth Marine regiment was the primary ground force
                    in the battle for Hue. When the Tet offensive began, Warrant Officer Godwin, a
                    Marine counterintelligence officer, was stationed in the city of Hue. When the
                    communists took over Hue, Godwin was surrounded and finally ran out of water and
                    had to make a run for it. He was wounded and captured. Recently, I learned that
                    he survived his wounds and was imprisoned in a brutal jungle POW camp, where he
                    died. The communists assassinated thousands of civilians just south of Hue. The
                    victims included aid workers such as a German civilian nurse.</p>
                <p>During the recapture of Hue, a Marine counterintelligence detachment fought its
                    way back in along with a unit of Nung irregulars. These were Vietnamese of
                    Chinese ethnic heritage. The unit was basically an extended family, brothers and
                    fathers and sons and so forth, with their wives and children. I got to know them
                    pretty well once I joined the division. They were very loyal to us. We treated
                    them well. They were our security force. They managed to get back into Hue even
                    before the Fifth Marines. I was not involved in the fighting there. I heard
                    stories about the Hue Citadel and how difficult it had been to retake it. I went
                    back up to look at it. The Citadel had walls anywhere from six to 16 feet thick.
                    They finally had to be breached by using naval gunfire from the destroyers
                    offshore.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: We tried to accomplish two distinctly different objectives. Officially, we
                    were part of the “Phoenix Program,” which was aimed at “neutralizing” the Viet
                    Cong infrastructure, which meant killing or capturing them. So, we recruited
                    human intelligence sources, developed them, and gained information on leaders of
                    the Viet Cong infrastructure. We did this with some success. The competing
                    demand came from the division commander, who was under pressure to stop the
                    shelling of the Da Nang airbase with 122 mm rockets. If a rocket hit an F-4
                    aircraft, it was millions of dollars down the drain. The generals wanted that
                    stopped. In counterintelligence, we found ourselves also trying to develop
                    information about where those rockets were coming from. This was almost an
                    impossible task, because the rockets were basically supported on logs and fired
                    one at a time from clearings in the bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two guys carrying it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Our effort was not very productive, but we did succeed in uncovering some
                    of the caches of 122 mm rockets. One of the tools that we used was a “Rewards
                    Program.” The United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti later copied this
                    program. We paid for any and all munitions that Vietnamese people brought to us,
                    no questions asked. We paid very sizable sums for 122 mm rockets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this part of the Chieu Hoi program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes. The First Marine Division also pioneered an offshoot of the Chieu Hoi
                    (which means “rally”) program that we called the Kit Carson Scout Program. Early
                    in the First Marine Division's time in Vietnam, Marines began to use Vietnamese
                    who had defected from the Viet Cong to provide area knowledge and warning of
                    mines and booby traps. This worked very well. It got harder, however, because
                    after Tet, there were almost no local force Viet Cong left in I Corps (the
                    northernmost sector of South Vietnam). They had been wiped out. Almost all of
                    the enemy forces in I Corps were North Vietnamese. They didn't have the area
                    knowledge that South Vietnamese guerrillas would have had. They were as foreign
                    to the local area as we were. But otherwise the program was very successful.
                    We'd go out each month and recruit defectors from the enemy forces. Then we ran
                    our recruits through a version of Marine Corps boot camp. We trained them in
                    Marine infantry techniques. We familiarized them with our weapons. They were
                    then paired each one up with a Marine and they went out on patrol on the point.
                    They saved a large number of Marine lives. Many of them fought quite heroically.
                    A couple of them, had they been Americans, would have won decorations such as
                    the Silver Star. They were very effective at what they did. The Marines
                    initially were very skeptical that anyone who used to be an enemy could be
                    trusted. To solve that problem, we would bring the scouts' prospective Marine
                    “buddies” up to our camp for the graduation. We had a trip wire course set up on
                    some trails nearby with firecrackers instead of land mines. We had the Marines
                    first go through the course alone. Normally, they would trip at least one wire.
                    Then we had the Scouts go through with the Marines. The scouts picked up trail
                    signs and the location of the mines, and they proved to the Marines that they
                    were useful people to have around. I ran that program with a couple of great
                    Marine sergeants. I also ran the counterintelligence effort for the division.
                    Our biggest operation was Operative Meade River. In November 1968, just before I
                    was due to come home, we received intelligence that there were a large number of
                    Viet Cong civilian leaders in an area called the “Arizona Area” south of Da
                    Nang. Because of the quality of the information, we were able to persuade the
                    commanding general to put nine battalions, the equivalent of a Marine division
                    into a cordon and search operation. Most of the battalions were from the First
                    Marine Division, but the Third Marine Division also sent some troops in. We
                    cordoned off an area of three kilometers by 10 kilometers. We knew that the Viet
                    Cong infrastructure members would go underground into tunnels and caves, and
                    that they would have enough food and water for a week to two weeks. The idea was
                    that if we stayed there longer than two weeks, they would have to come out. What
                    we didn't know was that just before we put the cordon in, the Republic of Korea
                    Marine brigade that was stationed at an area of responsibility adjacent to our
                    prospective operational area would fight an engagement with a North Vietnamese
                    regiment, which would retreat into the area we were about to cordon. As a
                    result, the operation began with a large conventional engagement in which about
                    1,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed. Then we evacuated the entire
                    population from the area. Contrary to some of the things one reads about
                    Vietnam, the evacuation was done in a very civilized way. We had a tent camp set
                    up complete with entertainment, food, and medical care. But we did screen the
                    population. Between that screening and people who came out of the caves and
                    tunnels afterwards, we captured about 72 civilian officials of the Viet Cong.
                    That was Operation Meade River.</p>

                <p>Q: Here you were, running intelligence. CIA is up to its neck in this thing,
                    particularly the Phoenix Program. The Army must have been doing this. Weren't
                    you sort of tripping over each other?</p>
                <p>WARD: Definitely. In fact, one of the big problems in Vietnam was self-confirming
                    intelligence. Normally, before acting, we liked to have two sources with the
                    same information. But what would happen is that entrepreneurial Vietnamese were
                    selling their information to multiple agencies. In Da Nang city, there was a
                    large Air Force Office of Special Investigations detachment that had a lot of
                    money and bought a lot of information. That was a problem. We tended to operate,
                    as Marines usually do, more at the grassroots level. So we tended to have our
                    own sources of information.</p>

                    briefings and these things just struck me as “We've cleared out this. We've done
                    this.” They were delivered with great aplomb and all this and I found myself
                    very dubious about what they were saying. This was a problem often at least with
                    the Army. If you're told that you've got to clear out a place, if nothing else,
                    you're going to say you cleared it out. Was trying to find out what really
                    happened a problem?</p>
                <p>WARD: Certainly getting an accurate picture of what was happening in an
                    environment where almost none of us had language skills was a big problem. In
                    terms of the security, I'd have to say that Tet was a watershed. After Tet,
                    security dramatically improved. Between Da Nang and Hue, there was a pass called
                    the Hai Van Pass. Before Tet and during Tet, no one drove over that pass except
                    in a convoy. It was just too dangerous. After Tet, you could drive from Da Nang
                    to Hue without being in a convoy. You could just set out and go. They even
                    restored railroad service between Hue and Da Nang.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went with a British vice consul. I think we had a
                        driver. Wjust drove up.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WARD: It was a nice drive. By the time I left, we were driving around
                    extensively. I had teams of two people with each battalion. We were spread out.
                    My job was to sort of run this. So, I'd be driving all the time. You'd always
                    worry a little bit about land mines. You had sand bags on the floors of our
                    jeeps. But we could drive almost anywhere. The only place I could not drive to
                    was An Hoa, in the southwest sector of the area of responsibility. It was not a
                    good idea to drive there except in a convoy. I drove, for example, down to Hoi
                    An, which is a provincial capital south of Da Nang and north of Chu Lai. It was
                    a delightful place where you could get good seafood. I drove up to Hue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Marine Corps
                        leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I'm an unabashed fan of the Marine Corps. I think the leadership was
                    excellent. The Marine Corps, along with the rest of the defense establishment,
                    went through a very difficult time in the latter stages of the Vietnam War.
                    There was a point beginning in 1968 at which we had to take draftees. The Marine
                    Corps expanded from 190,000 to over 300,000 during Vietnam. In order to achieve
                    those numbers, we had to take draftees. That was a problem. You don't want
                    people in the Marines who don't want to be there. We had some serious
                    disciplinary problems. We had serious racial problems in the division.
                    Traditionally, one of the garrison duties of counterintelligence is to
                    investigate threats against the command from within. So, we had a subsidiary
                    mission of keeping track of the racial unrest, which was significant. My clerk
                    was a young African-American corporal. He was very loyal to us and did his job.
                    I found out that some African-American Marines who were just out of control
                    threatened his life. We ran anti-drug operations and seized large quantities of
                    narcotics. At one point, we cordoned off an area where there were a large number
                    of Army and Marine deserters, 500 or so. It was a big problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saigon was just loaded.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: An area near Red Beach in Da Nang tended to be where deserters would
                    gravitate. We swept through and gathered up all these people. That was a low
                    time for the Marine Corps. I left active duty not just because I wanted to come
                    into the Foreign Service, but also because I was depressed by the state of the
                    Marine Corps. We never lost a fight in Vietnam, but the climate of the times
                    hurt the Corps. I stayed in the Reserves until 1978 and was promoted to major.
                    At that point, I found that my work in the Foreign Service left no time for the
                    Reserves, and I resigned my commission.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were in Da Nang, we had a consular representative up there. Here you
                    had this Foreign Service commission in your back pocket. Did you get any chance
                    to take a look at the foreign affairs side?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WARD: No, the closest I got to that was visits with the Marine
                    counterintelligence chief at Headquarters, III Marine Amphibious Force in Da
                    Nang. John Gunther, who later became the intelligence chief of the Marine Corps,
                    was in charge of counterintelligence for III MAF. Trips to III MAF were a big
                    thrill - they had toilets that flushed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the CORDS people were Foreign Service

                </p>
                <p>WARD: I met a lot of CORDS people, but I do not recall any FSOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were pretty well tied up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I had plenty to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in late '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I was a regular officer, and at the time the Marine Corps was not
                    accepting resignations of regulars. They had assigned me to train reservists in
                    Illinois. The freeze on resignations was lifted while I still was in Vietnam,
                    and I put in a request to be assigned to the Washington area, since I planned to
                    come into the Foreign Service, my wife and baby daughter were in the Washington
                    area, and it didn't make sense to move me to Chicago. As often happens in the
                    military, I heard nothing back from my request. My wife, however, was living in
                    an apartment complex where my map-reading instructor from Basic School also
                    lived. He was a major and had been seriously wounded, given the last rites three
                    times. He was working at headquarters Marine Corps. My wife told him how silly
                    it was that we were going to have to go to Chicago for my final six months in
                    the Corps, only then to have to move back to Washington. Our friend was at least
                    able to get someone to read my request. Consequently, I was assigned for my last
                    six months to the counterintelligence branch of Headquarters Marine Corps. This
                    was a time of great social unrest, and the Marine Corps leadership was trying to
                    come to grips with things that were happening in American society and that were
                    very foreign to them. General Lou Walt, who was a crusty combat Marine, was at
                    that point the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps. I was assigned to write
                    a paper to explain what was going on in the protest movement. As
                    counterintelligence, we were supposed to know about such things. I remember
                    writing a paper in which I used the phrase “Third World.” I was later summoned
                    to go up to explain to General Walt what the Third World was. He said, “If there
                    is a Third World, what are the First and Second Worlds?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I received an offer to join the A-100 course that begaon June 19,
                    1969.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was different. I also took a big cut in pay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only a big cut in pay, but also responsibility
                        completely something different. You had been around the block. How did you

                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were others in my class who had just come back from Vietnam. I think
                    of Dave Papst, who had been an Army officer and aide to one of the generals in
                    Saigon, and Carl Jonietz, who had been an Air Force intelligence specialist in
                    Vietnam. Others in the class such as Ralph Johnson and David Pitts were also
                    veterans. I remember being a bit irked by some of the people who were just out
                    of college and maybe had a year of work experience. Some of them seemed to
                    project an air of superiority. They also got higher salaries because of the
                    stupid way in which the Bureau of Personnel evaluated military experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your class have minorities, women, in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Our class included a couple of African-Americans, a Hispanic, and a
                    Hawaiian native. We had about five women. Most of the minorities dropped out
                    during training or shortly afterward. No one else dropped out during training. I
                    felt this happened because, with a couple of exceptions, the minority entrants
                    were placed in a situation that they were not prepared for in anything but an
                    academic sense. They left because they did not feel at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '69 was the height of the protests. Did you feel the bloom
                        hagone off the rose for government work? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WARD: The atmosphere in society at large was certainly not conducive to
                    government service. However, inside the Department, I sensed a commitment to the
                    Service that was solid. Personally, I saw the struggle in Southeast Asia as part
                    of a larger worldwide struggle with a totalitarian system that needed to be won.
                    I consciously thought that although we were not winning in Vietnam the struggle
                    could continue on other fronts. I saw the Foreign Service as a place where I
                    could continue to continue to make a contribution to defeating an inimical force
                    in the world - communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got in, did you have any idea of what sort of
                        specialtyou might want?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I did. I knew I wanted to be a political officer, and on the basis of
                    little knowledge I was convinced that I wanted to go to Eastern Europe. That
                    aspiration ran up against the State Department's policy of not assigning
                    first-tour officers to Eastern Europe. Charlie Thomas was the assistant director
                    of my entering class. I think it may have been Charlie who said, “Well, we're
                    going to get you as close to Eastern Europe as we can.” They sent me to Hamburg,
                    which was 30 kilometers from the inner-German border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Hamburg from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: 1970-1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like going to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was great. My family loved Hamburg, and I loved my job. I feel for the
                    officers these days who have to go to visa mills and sit on a stool behind a
                    window for eight hours a day and make decisions every 30 seconds. I'm not sure
                    what I would have done in a situation like that. In Hamburg, we had 20-odd
                    Americans. We had enough work to keep us busy, but not so much that there was no
                    time for other things. I did consular work, but I also had time for political
                    work. We had a youth program in Germany at the time, which I thought was a
                    wonderful program. It encouraged the junior officers to get out and meet young
                    German politicians and other young leaders. The embassy had a youth committee
                    that met every year. One year we hosted the youth committee in Hamburg. Dick
                    Miles, who at the time was in Belgrade, came up because he was interested in
                    doing something similar in Yugoslavia. Dick's path and mine were to cross again
                    and again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hamburg was part of Hanover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WARD: No, Hamburg was a Land on its own, one of the ten Laender of the Federal
                    Republic. Politics in Hamburg were dominated by the Social Democrats. I think
                    the Christian Democrats won an election in the mid-'50s or maybe early '60s and
                    after a few months everyone agreed that they were not capable of governing the
                    city. The next election restored Social Democratic control. Later, when I was
                    posted in Bonn, the Christian Democrats had another shot at running Hamburg, but
                    again, after a couple of years, the Social Democrats took over again.</p>
                <p>In a way, Hamburg was almost the ideal first post. It would have been still
                    better had it been an embassy, but the Hamburgers took the consulate very
                    seriously, and we got involved in a lot of things. It was fun. As a family, we
                    used the time to see Europe. It was a great place to learn German. It wasn't
                    Bonn, where you could speak English and get by. You had to use German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of protests about Vietnam. How did that
                        impacon you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It really did. In 1970, when we went into Cambodia, there was a large and
                    violent demonstration outside the Amerika Haus. We knew it was going to happen.
                    I happened to be duty officer and they thought, “Well, this guy is a former
                    Marine. He knows how to do this stuff.” So, they sent me down to the Amerika
                    Haus to witness a pitched battle between the German police and protesters with a
                    lot of force being used, a lot of injured policemen. I don't know how many
                    injured protesters there were. There were probably 30 policemen injured fairly
                    seriously and a lot of tear gas. I stood on the roof of the Amerika Haus
                    watching it. The week before, a smaller group had actually gotten into Amerika
                    Haus and did some damage. Yes, there was that undertone, but not so much that I
                    felt the average German disliked America. I took courses at the University of
                    Hamburg to help my German. I went to class and never felt hostility directed
                    against Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: It's always struck me that the Europeans, particularly in France and Germany,
                    seem to take protests much more seriously than... They dress up for it and there
                    seems to be more of an ideology behind it.</p>
                <p>WARD: That was true then and it also appears to be the case now. The people
                    protesting against what they called “globalization” or the Free Trade Agreement
                    are taking things pretty seriously also. But back in the 1970s in Germany there
                    was a very live and strong underground movement of political extremists. It was
                    the time of the Bader-Meinhoff group, when the stage was being set for the
                    assassinations that became endemic in Germany. There were a lot of extremists
                    around, and they were willing to use violence. That night at Amerika Haus, force
                    was what we saw, a lot of it on both sides - on the police side, water cannons
                    and tear gas and on the demonstrators' side, rocks and sticks. They were
                    fighting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your youth work or making contact with politicians,
                        what wayour impression of the German political class that had emerged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I have to say that I had then and still have with some exceptions fairly
                    high regard for German politicians. They tend to be serious people. They tend to
                    be well informed on the issues. Their system is very different from ours and
                    sometimes that causes a lack of understanding on both sides. One understands the
                    freedom that Americans have only when you live in another society, which
                    although constitutionally free is still so much more structured and where form
                    and tradition limit individuals much more. That was certainly true in Germany in
                    1970, and I think continues to be true in Germany today. When I covered the
                    Greens in 1984-1985, I attended a Green party convention in one of the small
                    cities in the Ruhr district in North Rhine Westphalia. The Greens were a very
                    colorful group. At a Greens convention, you would find men and women knitting,
                    dogs running around, kids running around, people of all shapes and sizes. It was
                    very raucous. But when I looked outside my window that night at a pedestrian
                    crossing - it was pouring rain and there was no traffic - there were probably 30
                    Greens waiting for the light to change so they could cross a deserted street. I
                    think it was Lenin who said that when the German railroad workers launch a
                    revolution, they would pay for the tickets needed to get on the platform at the
                    railroad station.</p>
                <p>You have a society that combines a tradition of obedience to rules with the
                    tendency to act out according to ideological commitment. When ideological
                    commitment bumps up against German society's rules, the outcome can be
                    surprisingly violent. I do not believe that German extremist groups have lost
                    their potential for violence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular consular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WARD: I remember a 12-passenger freighter full of American senior citizens that
                    was sold in mid-Atlantic to a company that no longer wanted to transport
                    passengers. When they came into port, we had a situation where the captain and
                    the passengers were not even speaking to each other. The passengers refused to
                    leave. The captain was desperate to get them off because a ship in port costs a
                    lot of money. This gave me my first experience in mediation, shuttle diplomacy.
                    I shuttled between the captain's stateroom and the passengers' dining room
                    trying to cut a deal for the passengers. They got a very sweet deal. The
                    shipping line was desperate to have them off that ship. They finally left with
                    money and free plane tickets and all sorts of things. I also remember dealing
                    with some American deserters who had returned from Scandinavia. Once, an
                    American deserter turned himself in to me. I think he figured that he would fare
                    better if he turned himself in at a consulate than to the Army. While I was
                    talking with him, he looked at my shoes, which were shined, a habit I picked up
                    in the Marine Corps. He said, “Were you ever in the military?” I said,
                    “Actually, I just left the military.” I think I ruined his game plan. He had
                    hoped for a more sympathetic ear. I remember testifying at his general court
                    martial later that year. He was convicted of desertion, which is a fairly hard
                    charge to prove in the military, as opposed to simple absence without leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Alexander Johnpoll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was political counselor in Belgrade when I was there in
                        th'60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: And he had been Deputy Director of German Affairs and had had a significant
                    hand in negotiating the Austrian state treaty. For me, he'll always been the
                    symbol of the old Foreign Service. He was extremely formal. I remember that he
                    made the Fourth of July celebration an affair for which wives - there were no
                    spouses then - were expected to make hors d'oeuvres, but were not invited to
                    attend. He was very competent, and the consulate was well run. We passed
                    inspections and so forth. But he was a man of the old school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop here. This would be
                        1972.Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was assigned to the Operations Center.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 3, 2001. 1972, the Ops Center. Did that
                        assignmencome out of the blue or did you have anything to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WARD: As they do every year, the Executive Secretariat had sent a telegram out to
                    posts asking ambassadors and principal officers to recommend people for the Ops
                    Center. I think the consul general recommended me. So, the assignment came
                    through that way. I left Hamburg in February 1972 and arrived in March at the
                    Ops Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ops Center has gone through various transformations.
                        I1972, how did it fit into the scheme of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Basically we were the 911 center for the foreign affairs community. The
                    center had been recently re-organized and overhauled because of perceptions that
                    the system had broken down when a sailor from a Soviet ship fled to a Coast
                    Guard vessel and then was returned to Soviet custody. The whole episode occurred
                    without proper consideration by high-level people here in Washington and several
                    people ended up with egg on their faces. So they modernized the Ops Center and
                    increased its ability to communicate with other operations centers around town -
                    the White House Situation Room, the Pentagon's National Military Command Center,
                    and the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was initially a junior watch officer and then editor for the morning and
                    afternoon brief that we put together for the Secretary and other principals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a watch officer do? Were there any memorable
                        incidentthat you got involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The duties of the junior watch officer were to receive all incoming phone
                    calls, to monitor the news tickers and the printers that reproduced all incoming
                    substantive cables that were immediate precedence or higher, and to take action
                    to ensure that the relevant officers in the Department were alerted to important
                    situations. In terms of memorable incidents, I recall most of all some terrorist
                    incidents, especially the one during the Munich Olympic Games, when Arab
                    terrorists struck against the Israeli team. We were involved in attempting to
                    coordinate U.S. actions with regard to that.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a time when the Nixon administration was well in place. Did you have
                    any sense that the center of foreign policy was over at the NSC rather than the
                    State Department?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes, and that perception grew stronger when, later in 1972, I was assigned
                    to the Secretariat staff when William Rogers was Secretary. At that time, it was
                    quite clear that the State Department was not the center of activity on several
                    aspects of policy, most importantly on Vietnam and on the then secret openings
                    towards China. Nick Platt, who was the director of the Secretariat staff, was
                    personally involved in the opening toward China. In fact, he accompanied
                    Kissinger on the first trip to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any intimations about the opening to China
                        until thofficial announcement came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: One knew a little bit more than was in the press because Nick Platt was
                    involved, but it was kept pretty much under wraps. I did not personally know
                    much other than that something was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Secretary goes up to the United Nations, he's up
                        therfor a week or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It varies. He usually stays one week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things are going on that his staff is
                        supporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Normally, the President will go up to the United Nations for a couple of
                    days. The President gives a speech at the opening of the General Assembly and
                    has meetings with the United Nations Secretary General, the president of the
                    General Assembly, and with a few other foreign leaders. The Secretary usually
                    then stays up at the UN for several days and continues a pattern of meetings
                    with foreign counterparts, basically a long series of bilateral meetings. There
                    are also typically group receptions for regional leaders. Sometimes the
                    President does those. He will sometimes do an event for Latin American or
                    African heads of government. But the division of labor varies according to how
                    much the President and the Secretary want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Secretariat's function was to arrange the Secretary's schedule of
                    bilateral meetings, to act as control officers for the meetings, to make sure
                    that the Memoranda of Conversation got done, and to do some of the reporting of
                    the meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any trips while you were with the
                        OpCenter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WARD: New York was my only trip during my assignment to the Ops Center, but when
                    I worked with the Secretariat staff, I did travel overseas. I went on three long
                    trips, one with the Deputy Secretary, Kenneth Rush. We went to Hawaii, Hong
                    Kong, Dacca, Kathmandu, Islamabad, where we dedicated the new chancery, which
                    years later was burned down by a mob, Kabul, New Delhi, Tehran, and Geneva. We
                    were supposed to go to Sri Lanka but did not because their former prime minister
                    had died and the country was in mourning. We went on to Tehran for an NEA chiefs
                    of mission conference and then back through Geneva. It was a long trip that had
                    several purposes. Then in the fall of 1973, I accompanied Secretary Kissinger on
                    a couple of trips in the immediate aftermath of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. It
                    was a period of epic shuttle diplomacy. The Secretary would use several teams of
                    staff people to support those trips. Typically, one team would go ahead to a
                    destination, do the advance work, work during the visit, and then join the
                    Secretary on the plane. The team that had been on the plane would get a rest and
                    go on to another stop. For example, on one of those trips, I advanced the
                    Secretary's visit to Riyadh, which happened to be the first time he went to
                    Riyadh. From there, I traveled separately to Tokyo to advance that stop. On
                    another trip, we went to Jerusalem and then to Madrid. It was a very intense
                    time and the issues were very important. It was a fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working on memos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: On trips, the Secretariat staff makes sure that the Secretary's schedule is
                    arranged efficiently and that needed briefing papers are available. The advance
                    officer is responsible for ensuring that the program gets set up, that all the
                    physical arrangements are right. That was a challenge in Riyadh because the
                    phone system was very balky and we had to set up satellite phones, which was a
                    harder task then than it is now. The internal phone system in the Saudi guest
                    palace was basically non-functional, and we had people laying wire inside the
                    palace at midnight. Surprises and complications were the norm during trip
                    advances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any feel for how things were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes. At that time, there were many opportunities to interact with the
                    senior staff, sometimes to take notes at meeting, to write up a lot of the
                    memoranda of conversation, and to read all the papers. So I had a chance to see
                    basically everything that was coming out of those meetings. It was extremely
                    interesting to watch Kissinger, albeit at a distance, operate. I sometimes felt
                    he was trying to build a house of cards with the hope that if he built it fast
                    enough, some parts would always be standing even if other parts collapsed. I
                    think that's what happened. He was also able to modulate his approach in a way
                    that was really masterful, taking a very different tack with Israeli PM Golda
                    Meier than with Egyptian President Sadat.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Saudi or Israeli
                        officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. In advancing the visit to Riyadh, I remember working with the Saudis.
                    I would not say they were difficult to work with, but they were reluctant to
                    expose the inadequacies in their facilities. I remember, for example, that every
                    room in the guest palace had a telephone in it, but every time I picked up a
                    telephone, there was never a dial tone. I kept pressing them on the question of
                    whether the phone system worked, and they assured me it did. The day before the
                    visit was going to occur, the system still didn't work. I said, “Could I see the
                    switchboard?” It turned out there wasn't one. In fact, the phones weren't
                    connected to anything. The phone system had never been finished and that is why
                    we ended up laying wire between rooms to make sure the phones worked. Also at
                    the last minute, we had to get a satellite hookup to assure communications with
                    the U.S. The Saudis were very hospitable and helpful, but at the same time they
                    did not want to expose the failings in their system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Israel? How did you find operating
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The trip to Jerusalem was a very intense period. The Israelis were
                    extremely cooperative on logistics, but I had the sense that negotiations were
                    difficult. I came in on the Secretary's plane, so I didn't do the advance in
                    Jerusalem. We landed in Tel Aviv and were picked up by Israeli helicopters. If
                    this had been in the U.S., the helicopters would definitely have been VIP
                    models. I think the Israelis wanted to make a point that they had just come
                    through a war, so they provided ordinary troop-transport helos. The aircraft had
                    canvas seats along the wall and were crewed by people who looked as if they had
                    just been on a combat mission. We flew at less than treetop level from Tel Aviv
                    to Jerusalem. The weather was pretty bad both going in and coming out. I can
                    remember Marvin Kalb, one of the reporters on the plane, sitting across from me
                    on one of the helicopters. He had very long legs and was hunched over, tapping
                    out his report on a very small portable typewriter, working very intensely on a
                    very bumpy helicopter flight to Jerusalem. The Israelis were efficient. They
                    were helpful in making arrangements. Security was very tight both at the King
                    David Hotel, but also within the delegation. A lot of information was tightly
                    compartmentalized, and as a member of the Secretary's staff I was complicit in
                    his efforts to cut the consulate in Jerusalem out of distribution on reporting
                    on some meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to sit in as a note taker in any
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I did not get to sit in as a note taker in any of the meetings with the
                    Israelis in either Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, but I spoke extensively with people
                    like Joseph Sisco and Hal Saunders, and got to process all the raw Memoranda of
                    Conversation, turn them into cables and so forth. I had a pretty good
                    understanding of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a difference between the Memoranda with the
                        Israeliand with the Saudis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. There was a very distinctly different tone. With the Israelis,
                    Kissinger really could talk with the frankness that one can use only with an
                    ally. Some of the conversations were pretty heated. Sometimes the tone of voice
                    was louder than the conversational. That came through very clearly in the
                    MemCons. With the Egyptians and the Saudis, there was a lot more formality, a
                    lot more use of polite cordialities. Kissinger wanted to make sure that he
                    observed all of the customs. For example, on arrival in Riyadh, literally at the
                    foot of the steps of the plane, the scenario said that someone would serve
                    coffee and that they would continue to pour additional cups until the recipient
                    turned his cup over and poured some coffee onto the runway, indicating he didn't
                    want any more. Kissinger wanted to observe all the formalities to make clear
                    that he was respectful of their culture.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were in Washington, what were you doing?</p>
                <p>WARD: Typically - and I think it's still true today - the Secretariat Staff
                    divides the department into groups of bureaus, and a team of staff officers is
                    assigned to serve as liaison between each group of bureaus and the offices of
                    the Secretary and other principal officers. At the time, all of the papers for
                    the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, and all of the Under Secretaries, went
                    through the Secretariat staff and staff officers looked through every action
                    memo, briefing memo, and information memo, to make sure that they were ready for
                    consideration by the principals of the Department. That's how we spent our days.
                    In addition to that, when we were back in Washington, some of us were preparing
                    for the next trip. It was a combination of staffing of everyday work and
                    preparing for the next trip. It was a very interesting time on the Secretariat
                    because it was a time of transition from Rogers to Kissinger. There was a very
                    distinct change of pace and focus in the Department once Kissinger took
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this when you became aware of where the power
                        lay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I think that awareness increased after the change took place and you
                    could see the difference in the way the Department operated once Kissinger got
                    there. People were working very hard. They even tended to move physically more
                    quickly. Everyone was in a rush. Kissinger had to learn how to use the
                    Department. He was not particularly rapid in changing his style from that of a
                    White House staffer and solitary operator. When he came over to the Department,
                    he wanted to retain his Secret Service detail and had to be convinced that SY,
                    Security, had the capabilities to protect him adequately. He was concerned about
                    his physical safety. I was assigned help SY convince the Secretary. Marvin
                    Gentile was the Assistant Secretary for SY and he was very anxious to take over
                    protection for the Secretary. I put together a briefing book to give the
                    Secretary all the information he needed to make a decision on whether State
                    Department security could take over his detail. The White House was ready to
                    allow him to retain a Secret Service detail. In fact, he did for quite some
                    time. I accompanied the then Executive Secretary of the Department, Tom
                    Pickering, to brief the Secretary. Kissinger asked additional questions, and I
                    had to do yet an additional briefing book on security. It was quite a while
                    after he arrived at State that he agreed to dispense with his Secret Service
                    detail.</p>
                <p>But on substance, he did increasingly rely on the Department. He made an effort
                    tand I think this is contrary to the image that Kissinger had outside, that he
                    worked only with a very small number of people - work with a larger number of
                    people in the Department. He made an effort to visit various bureaus and to be
                    briefed.</p>
                <p>Q: I've talked to somebody who was staff assistant to Warren Christopher when he
                    was Deputy Secretary and he kept telling him to go eat in the cafeteria, go
                    visit some bureaus, but he never could get him out.</p>
                <p>WARD: It's hard for the principals. They have so many obligations outside the
                    building and on the seventh floor. They have to make a distinct effort to get
                    out. I know Kissinger had the goal of visiting every bureau in the Department.
                    Every bureau had to write a memorandum, prepare a briefing, which we had to
                    preview. I know that he didn't complete that round of visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this intensity do to the home life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My long hours at work and absences on trips caused me to miss a lot of time
                    with my family. My wife was very understanding. During one of my Washington
                    assignments, my daughter asked my wife if Daddy was on a trip. I wasn't, but I
                    left for work in the morning before my daughter got up and got home after she
                    went to bed. I'm very glad that I had an understanding wife. I think that my
                    daughter looks back on the Foreign Service in a positive way, but certainly the
                    long working hours were a high price to pay for an interesting job.</p>
                <p>Q: You left this Ops/Secretariat thing when?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WARD: I left the Operations Center in '72 and then I was on the Secretariat Staff
                    until early 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I then went to language training to go to Genoa, Italy, which was not my
                    original assignment. I had been assigned to Rome as staff assistant to the
                    ambassador, but the incumbent staff assistant extended, so I ended up going to
                    Genoa as political/economic officer. I did not want to go back to another
                    consulate, but I was already in language training and Italy was a very
                    attractive place to go.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to when you were in Ops/Secretariat work, did you have the feeling that
                    you were a selective group? Was this a hothouse for training people who later
                    moved up?</p>
                <p>WARD: I think that was true of both places. First, there was no better way to
                    gain understanding of how the Department worked and to get to know the
                    personalities within the Department than working in the Ops Center and the
                    Secretariat. Secondly, the Department made an effort to select people who could
                    do an excellent job. Thinking back, a large number of the people with whom I
                    worked there ended up playing key roles. I think of Ray Seitz, who was with me
                    on “the line” in the Secretariat Staff at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was later ambassador in London, first and only Foreign
                        Servicofficer...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Ray stood out above everyone. Bob Blackwill was another. In fact, Ray and
                    Bob were partners on one team, which was a very formidable one. Bob Blackwill is
                    now going out as ambassador to New Delhi; he was also a senior director on the
                    National Security Council staff and ambassador to the Conference on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe, now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe. Lange Schermerhorn, Gib Lanpher, and April Glaspie were also there. I'm
                    probably forgetting others. A large number of colleagues in the Secretariat
                    later became chiefs of mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lange Schermerhorn just retired. She had been working for
                        me iVietnam. I think it was Bob Miller who was administrator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. We had two Bob Millers in the Secretariat; one wadeputy executive
                    secretary and the other the executive director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This one had been with me at Belgrade. I had suggested
                        thaLange was a very good officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WARD: You're thinking of the Bob Miller who had been deputexecutive
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of us were pointing out young officers under us who
                        werpeople with potential.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was probably the best place to go for a first Washingtoassignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Genoa from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: From the summer of 1974 until the summer of 1976. It was a two-year
                    assignment. That was the pattern at the time; junior officer assignments were
                    two years. The cone system was just beginning. There was no such thing as a cone
                    when I came in. I didn't know for a long time what my specialty was. It wasn't
                    like it is today where everyone is focused on one specialty from the first
                    day.</p>
                <p>Q: Things sort of fell out before they had cones. You kind of ended up where you
                    wanted to be. I was a consular officer. I just drifted into it.</p>
                <p>WARD: Right. I think most people ended up where they wanted to be,but it was a
                    very mysterious process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably worked a little better. Who was your consul
                        generain Genoa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My consul general was Gori Bruno. Even the name is interesting because no
                    Italian would believe that was really his name because “Gori” is not a given
                    name in Italian. It's a surname. So, they wanted to call him Bruno Gori. But the
                    Gori was the family name of his father's best friend. When his father came to
                    the United States, he named his son Gori.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was of Italian extraction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: He was of Italian descent. He was a consular officer, had come up, as many
                    did, through the Foreign Service Staff ranks and had become a Foreign Service
                    officer. Being consul general in Genoa was his last tour. He was a darned good
                    consul general. He took it very seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Genoa, '74-'76. Where did it fall in the political
                        spectrum oItaly and how did it fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WARD: This was a fascinating time to be in Italy. Genoa had always been a city
                    with a large union-dominated communist party. A socialist-communist majority
                    ruled the city with a socialist mayor. Despite all that, Genoa was and is a very
                    moderate city. The Genoese are commercial people. They are seafaring people.
                    They are businesspeople. They are extremely serious. It's also a very insular
                    place. The key relationships among the important families of Genoa were
                    established in the 12th through the 14th centuries, when Genoa was a great
                    power. It was a very proud place. It was also a city that to my mind had been on
                    a slightly declining since about the 14th century. But it was a great place to
                    learn Italian politics because politicians were everywhere, and they were
                    accessible. There was a lot going on. The Red Brigades were just getting started
                    as a terrorist organization. They kidnaped one of the prosecuting judges in
                    Genoa, Mario Sossi. Another judge made a deal with the Red Brigades to get Sossi
                    out. Then when Sossi was released, the other judge went back on the deal and
                    some of the Red Brigades were killed. The Red Brigades marked this judge for
                    assassination. While I was there, he was assassinated, despite the fact that he
                    had 24-hour security protection. Several of my close political contacts were
                    “kneecapped.” One was assassinated while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kneecapped meaning...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Shot in the knee. It was a technique that the Red Brigade used. It was a
                    time also when among the left and certainly among the extreme left, there was
                    extreme anti-Americanism. Kissinger was a negative symbol of America for them,
                    and when he traveled to Europe at one point, there was a generalized threat
                    against American officials. We had Italian police living outside our apartment
                    for several weeks, which impressed my daughter and my neighbors. My neighbors
                    were very upset because Genoese are known to pinch the penny and they were
                    concerned that the carabinieri were keeping the lights on in the apartment
                    house. But it was a fascinating time. It was also the time when the Italian
                    socialists were beginning to re-construct their party as a moderate force under
                    the leadership of Bettino Craxi. In 1976, I was transferred from Genoa to the
                    political section in Rome. After home leave, I began covering the non-communist
                    left.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's stick to Genoa first. What were you getting from the socialists? Somehow
                    they were a party in the rest of Europe, but the socialists in Italy had lost
                    out to the communists as a left-wing movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes. The reasons that they lost to the communists were many, some of which
                    are shrouded in the history of the party in the 1920s. Basically, the socialists
                    were at a disadvantage at the end of the war because the communists had been
                    much more effective in the partisan battle against the Germans. The communists
                    were able, in my view, to inflate their accomplishments and set themselves up as
                    the people who saved Italy, which in the larger historical picture is nonsense.
                    The socialists therefore were disadvantaged. The communists also were better
                    organized than the socialists. The socialists seemed also to be more blatantly
                    out for personal political gain than the communists, although there was a good
                    bit of that going on in the Communist Party also. The joke at the time was that
                    PSI did not stand for Partito Socialisti Italiano (Italian Socialist Party); it
                    stood for Partito Sindaci Italiani, the Party of Italian Mayors. The socialists
                    were content to be the balance of power party. In a center-left coalition, with
                    the Christian Democrats, they would provide the mayor. In a center-left
                    coalition with the communists, they would also provide the major. They had
                    11-12% of the electorate, but they held the balance of power in many key
                    cities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: No. At the consulate level, we did not work with the communists, talk with
                    the communists, or have meetings with them except to the extent that they were
                    government officials. Later, in Rome, we had one person in the political section
                    who opened relations with the Communist Party and began under Richard Gardner,
                    the ambassador, to very carefully widen relations with people within the
                    Communist Party. Initially, the relationship was limited to this particular
                    officer, Marty Wenick. He was able to speak with literally one person within the
                    PCI, the Italian Communist Party. That later was widened a little bit. The
                    ambassador did not meet with communists, although the communists attempted to
                    create the impression that the Carter administration was opening to them. The
                    backdrop to everything was growing terrorism. It was a time when former PM Aldo
                    Mora was kidnaped and eventually murdered.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: The only connection was that both the Communist Party and thterrorists were
                    getting assistance from the Warsaw Pact.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Genoa, what about the Christian Democrats? Were they

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WARD: The Christian Democrats had a fairly large contingent on the city council.
                    In the province of Genoa, which included the suburbs, I think the Christian
                    Democrats had a majority. They also were fairly strong in the Ligurian regional
                    government until the elections of 1975, when the left did very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel about the problem that later broke
                        thwhole political system down a couple of decades later, corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The great enigma is the personality of Bettino Craxi. He emerged in the
                    mid-seventies as a moderate, reform-minded socialist. He became prime minister,
                    but was forced from office in disgrace. He lived out his last years in exile in
                    Tunisia under threat of arrest for corruption if he ever set foot in Italy. In
                    working with Craxi and his people, I had the sense that there was a great deal
                    going on underneath the table. Craxi's senior aides always seemed to wear Rolex
                    watches and snazzy suits that they should not have been able to afford. In the
                    1970s, the embassy assessed Craxi as a much more effective leader than the old
                    guard among the socialists, and as someone who could help keep the communists
                    out of power. Giulio Andreotti, the Christian Democratic prime minister, seemed,
                    after all, intent upon creating an opening for the communists to enter the
                    government. If Craxi were corrupt, as certainly seems to have been the case, he
                    was no more corrupt that many other Italian politicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within Italian society, did you find that government
                        employees seemed to have two jobs, one they went to in the morning and then
                        all of a sudden they would disappear and they were doing something else, a
                        private business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were a lot of people with two jobs. When I was in Rome, it turned out
                    that one of the Italian employees in the embassy ran a watch repair business in
                    the embassy on U.S. government time. One of our employees in Genoa had a real
                    estate business as a sideline while he was working at the consulate. These
                    things were difficult to control. I had the impression, however, that officials
                    in the Italian foreign ministry, which was the only part of the Italian central
                    government that I had any real contact with, were pretty hardworking. They would
                    come in late in the morning, work until lunch, take a long break, and then start
                    to work again at 4:00 or 5:00 pm and stay until late. It made dealing with the
                    foreign ministry an interesting proposition. The focus of the embassy political
                    section was on Italian internal politics. We had one officer assigned to the
                    Christian Democratic Party, one assigned to the Communist Party, another officer
                    (me) assigned to the rest of the non-communist left. Then we had one officer who
                    did the foreign office and two who did political-military affairs.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WARD: I dealt with the Italian Socialist Party, the SociaDemocratic Party, the
                    Liberal Party, and the Republican Party.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was a direct transfer from Genoa. I got there in thsummer of 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Until summer of 1979, but I spent less than a year in the political
                    section. The new ambassador, Richard Gardner, asked me to be his executive
                    assistant. I agreed to do the job as a temporary assignment, and he later asked
                    me to stay for an extended tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been the ambassador prior?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: John Volpe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Ambassador Volpe visited Genoa while I was there in 1976. I was political,
                    economic, and commercial officer. We had put together a large economic
                    conference in commemoration of the bicentennial, and the ambassador came up to
                    open it. Ambassador Volpe was an intensely proud man. He was proud of the fact
                    that he had come from extremely humble origins. He told a story of his father
                    and mother. After his father had emigrated to the United States, he would write
                    to his mother back in their village in Abruzzo. She, however, could not read.
                    The local priest would read the father's letters to her. Volpe was very proud of
                    having made a fortune in the construction industry and risen to become Governor
                    of Massachusetts. He was also proud that he spoke Italian. However, his Italian
                    was heavily accented and dialectical. It was an American-Abruzzese dialect that
                    Italians sometimes had a difficult time understanding.</p>
                <p>Bob Beaudry, who was the DCM, ran the embassy very capably. Ambassador Volpe had
                    brought along an executive assistant, Tom Trimarco, who had been a business and
                    political associate in Massachusetts. Tom also had an important role within the
                    embassy, especially on some of the internal political questions. He was a fairly
                    controversial figure within the embassy because it was an unusual situation to
                    have both a DCM and a senior, substantive advisor to the ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that... Who did you go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. I never had a problem dealing with Tom, but Bob Beaudry was the boss.
                    Like Volpe, Bob was from New England. He had been the executive assistant to the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs U. Alexis Johnson during the time I was in
                    the Ops Center. Johnson had had a stroke. Bob did a fantastic job filling in for
                    the Under Secretary. After serving as DCM in Rome, he did not retire. He did not
                    become an ambassador, but he came back director of the office of western
                    European affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the core of the political-economic section in Rome? My
                    impression was that you had an awful lot of people who were back for the third
                    or fourth time and almost an insular approach.</p>
                <p>WARD: At that time, most of us were on our first or second tours in Italy. A few,
                    like Jim Creagan, Ted Russell, and Dan Serwer, subsequently spent a lot of time
                    in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Creagan was political officer in Naples.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Exactly. But at the time, the political section was made up of Ted Russell,
                    who covered the Christian Democratic Party and later became ambassador in
                    Slovakia; Roland Kuchel, who replaced Ted and became ambassador to Zambia; Marty
                    Wenick who covered the Communist Party and became Deputy Assistant Secretary in
                    INR and retired to a second career; Kathy Shirley, who covered the foreign
                    office and became ambassador in Senegal; and a few others. Kathy's husband, Jock
                    Shirley, was outstanding as the public affairs counselor. It was an
                    extraordinary group of people, man of whom went on to some pretty important
                    responsibilities elsewhere in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Dick Gardner. How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WARD: Dick Gardner is a good friend who treated me very well when I worked for
                    him. He was a very interesting man to work for, extremely cerebral and goal
                    oriented. In a sense, he was the ideal political appointee because he was well
                    versed in international affairs, he knew the issues, and he knew the people of
                    Italy. He was intensely focused on making a difference. He understood that Italy
                    was at a political crossroads, that the attitude the U.S. took toward the
                    Communist Party would be key, and that there were some people within the Italian
                    political system, including within the Christian Democratic party, such as PM
                    Giulio Andreotti, who were ready to open to the communists. He also understood
                    that while it was in the U.S. interest to have a better dialogue with the
                    communists, it was not in our interest to promote communist participation in the
                    government. In fact, on January 12, 1978, he had himself recalled to Washington
                    over the issue of communist participation in the government and organized a
                    series of meetings that resulted in a policy statement against such
                    participation. The new policy said basically, “The Italians need to make their
                    own political decisions. It's also up to us to choose our own friends. We prefer
                    to choose friends who have governments led by parties that accept democratic
                    pluralism.” In other words, not the PCI. That was a landmark event in U.S.-
                    Italian relations. Dick Gardner got that done. He was an extremely active
                    ambassador. He made speeches in Italian throughout the country. His speeches
                    were not the average ambassadorial speech. Each speech had a theme. Each speech
                    made a point. He was a perfectionist. Speeches would go through many drafts.
                    This got under the skin of some people, which I can understand that. No one
                    wants to be the drafter of a speech that goes through 10 drafts. So, that did
                    affect the attitude of some people within the embassy, although all of the key
                    officers recognized that Dick Gardner was a very smart man and was dedicated to
                    doing a good job. I always found him to be thoughtful of my family and me and
                    interested in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He seemed to have rather enjoyed dealing with the
                        universitstudents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: He was a university professor. He loved substance. He is a man of ideas. He
                    would have dinners that were unusual. After dinner he would lead a substantive
                    discussion on a pre-determined theme. He'd ask everybody to sit down in a
                    circle, and there would be a topic and a speaker and guests were expected to
                    discuss the topic. This was not something that Italians were used to doing. So,
                    you had to be careful whom you invited and had to manage the program carefully.
                    We also had an open forum within the embassy that served as a form of internal
                    dissent channel on substantive issues. It was the Ambassador's way of reaching
                    out. He reached on the basis of ideas. He was a man of little small talk and not
                    a glad-hander. In that sense, he was different from many non-career ambassadors.
                    It was an interesting approach. I thought it was in many respects quite a
                    productive one.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Q: One of the things that struck me about Italian politicI was consul general in
                    Naples from '79-'8was the extensive reporting and detail that was spent on
                    Italian politics, which seemed to be a minuet that was being played up in Rome.
                    We would get questions about “What is the effect of the latest change in the
                    Italian government up in Rome?” You'd go to Naples and get a shrug of the
                    shoulders. Ah, they're doing it again. It was a different world there. How many
                    people were covering the internal affairs? I was an outsider. What was your
                    impression? Did we get too involved in the ins and outs of this switching of
                    jobs in Rome?</p>
                <p>WARD: I think that we did spend an awful lot of time covering Italian internal
                    politics. It was a pattern that we fell into at the end of World War II, when we
                    poured tremendous resources into the country. We for decades opposed the
                    Communist Party and supported the forces that were against the communists. So,
                    internal political reporting became an industry that perpetuated itself. Looked
                    at from today's point of view, one wonders how we kept busy? But in the context
                    of the time, with a communist revolution in Portugal, with Kissinger very
                    concerned that there was a new wave of communism about to spread over Western
                    Europe, internal politics in Italy seemed extremely important. The non-communist
                    left was seen as a potential bulwark. If we could strengthen the non- communist
                    left, then the communists might not continue to surge toward power. So, I think
                    we were correct at the time in devoting most of our political effort to the
                    internal political scene. Frankly, Italy was not playing an important role in
                    terms of general foreign affairs within the NATO alliance. Italy's geopolitical
                    position is extremely important. But Italian diplomacy on the NATO stage or on
                    the world stage was not very important.</p>
                <p>Q: Kissinger said in his book that when he would fly to Rome, he would say
                    landing at the airport was probably the most significant thing he would do.
                    There was nobody to talk to in a way.</p>
                <p>WARD: Over the years, I tried to stay in touch with our relations with Italy,
                    especially during the time when I was involved in NATO affairs. I would get to
                    sit in on the Secretary's bilateral meetings with the foreign minister. They
                    contrasted very sharply with many of the other bilateral meetings because they
                    were focused basically on parochial questions, either Italian internal matters
                    or Italian ethnic status in the U.S. The relationship was very different than
                    our discourse with the other major European countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was a sense in 1975-1977 that the communists were the wave of the
                    future. Berlinguer projected a moderate image, and he did bring several
                    important moderates to places of power within the Party. Our analysis was that
                    although there were moderates within the Party, there were also quite a few
                    hardliners, and that the net balance was negative. Therefore, the Italian
                    Communist Party was not one that we could have a normal dialogue with or
                    support.</p>

                <p>Q: How did you find the various parties, like the Republicans and the Socialists?
                    Was this more a group of people looking at it as politicians or patriots or were
                    there real ideological goals?</p>
                <p>WARD: The Socialist Party at the time was being “reformed” by Bettino Craxi.
                    Despite his later image, he did renew the Party. Bettino Craxi and the people
                    around him at that time seemed to represent a vision similar to that projected
                    today by leaders like Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder, a sort of “third way.”
                    Craxi had a vision of the Socialists as a non-totalitarian alternative to a
                    communist future for Italy. All of that later got lost in a wave of corruption
                    that destroyed the Socialist Party.</p>
                <p>The Social Democrats were probably most corrupt on the spectrum. They were a
                    breakaway from the Socialist Party that never really found a role. They didn't
                    stand for much significant.</p>
                <p>The other two small parties, the Liberals and the Republicans, the PLI and the
                    PRI, actually did stand for something - the liberal and republican philosophies
                    that were very important in the 19th century, in the Resorgimento. They harked
                    back to that era and they were basically true to it. With some exceptions, their
                    leaders were not corrupt. They were idealists. They also had almost no political
                    clout. These were parties supported by less than five percent of voters.</p>
                <p>Q: My impression of Italy, which granted was a Neopolitan view, was that the name
                    of the game more than anything else was not ideology but jobs. I remember the
                    mayor of Naples, who was a communist, wanting to keep the Sixth Fleet coming in,
                    get more military in. It was jobs. This was the driving force behind so much, at
                    least in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. All over the world, all politics are local. In every part of Italy,
                    business and politics were much too closely intertwined. I remember a friend of
                    mine who was one of the young reformers in the Christian Democratic Party in the
                    Ligurian region around Genoa. He was an attractive candidate who increased his
                    party's percentage of the vote at a time when the communists were picking up a
                    lot of support. A couple of years later, without a university degree, without
                    any real professional experience, he ended up in Rome as the chief of public
                    relations for Alitalia, earning a very large salary, enough to keep his children
                    in private school in New York City. He really had no professional
                    qualifications. This was the kind of system that it was. It allowed people
                    through their political connections to move over into the world of the
                    state-controlled businesses. For me, the history of state-owned enterprises in
                    Italy are a warning to leaders in developing countries who think that they can
                    transition from socialism to a free market via a period of so-called
                    “commercialization” of state-run enterprises in which the government continues
                    to hold the stock but runs them on a business basis. It doesn't work because it
                    combines the worst features of socialism and capitalism. It didn't work in
                    Italy. It ruined the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much of a feeling of the sectionalism in
                        Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Our transfer from Genoa to Rome itself was striking. There wasn't much
                    difference between Genoa and Germany in terms of the way people abided by the
                    law, and lived their lives. (Although the Italian Riviera had a lot more
                    jetsetters than did Hamburg.) In Rome, I was startled by the disregard for the
                    traffic code. There were certain traffic lights that no one ever obeyed. Then
                    when you got to Naples, of course, it was total chaos on the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was like getting on the bus in Rome. I found that
                        nobody paithe fare.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was a tremendous sense of regional identity. I think we forget that
                    regional languages in Italy are still very important. People speak dialect every
                    day. Of course, I haven't been back to Italy in many years. At the embassy, we
                    realized that we were neglecting politics in the regions of the Rome consular
                    district so we assigned a reporting officer to each region. I took Sardinia
                    because I wanted to learn more about it. Talk about regional identity? Sardinia
                    was one of the most insular places I've ever been in my life. The Sardinian
                    people were intensely inbred, perhaps to their detriment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Berlinguer was from Sardinia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. He was from a very prominent and rich Sardinian family.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you run into the hand of the CIA? It had this tradition going back to
                    wartime and right after the war, the '48 election. Here was a government that
                    was basically corruptible and we were in a Cold War situation. Did this trip you
                    up?</p>
                <p>WARD: I don't think it tripped me up. There was a strong CIA station in Rome with
                    capable staff. There were a couple of incidents that ruffled feathers between
                    the political section and the Station. I never had a problem. In those
                    mid-1970s, Kissinger initiated a program of U.S. support for non-communist
                    political reformers, including funding. Remember that this was at a time when
                    the Communists had successfully engineered a revolution in Portugal. The program
                    would have involved State and the Agency, but at least on the State side, it was
                    canceled before it got off the ground. I think some of this has been in the
                    press since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. There was also the concern, which went way back, that
                        therwere secret societies within the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Also, the Free Masons played a role that was hard to figure out. I
                    don't know much about the Masons, but I did have one experience with them when I
                    was in Genoa. One of the things I had to do was host a U.S. trade mission. I
                    needed to recruit businesspeople to meet with the mission. I ran across this
                    fellow who was a Mason. He was a very mysterious person. In the U.S., one thinks
                    of the Masons as a social lodge. There, the organization was mysterious and
                    ideological. This person offered to help me make the trade show a success. He
                    invited me to his house one night. I remember driving along the Ligurian coast,
                    along winding roads, in a heavy rainstorm. Visibility was terrible and it was
                    not a particularly pleasant drive because the roads weren't very good. I got to
                    his house, which seemed to be protected by large dogs, and we talked for hours.
                    He spoke in semi-conspiratorial tones, and I did not grasp a lot of what he
                    said. But the bottom line is that he said he wanted to help me with the trade
                    mission. The next day, 100 businessmen called to ask for appointments with
                    members of the Mission. The people running the mission thought that was
                    fantastic. It happened through this Masonic connection. I never did a thing for
                    that fellow, but I think he thought I was helping him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably made a commitment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Of course, eventually, the behind-the-scenes role in Italian politics and
                    business of the so-called P-2 Masonic lodge emerged. I later thought, was that
                    fellow part of P-2? It was one of the stranger experiences that I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Vatican or Church affairs impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: At the time, we had a special envoy to the Vatican who had a separate
                    office; it wasn't yet Embassy Vatican. We had a succession of representatives.
                    Until the end of the Ford administration, it was Henry Cabot Lodge, and then
                    former-mayor Wagner of New York took over. The career person at the Vatican was
                    Peter Sarros. He worked fairly closely with the embassy. Under Carter, the envoy
                    became an ambassador. There was some controversy about that. Because the
                    ambassador to the Vatican wasn't regularly in Rome, Peter relied heavily on
                    Ambassador Gardner to host distinguished visitors. In turn, Peter helped us with
                    requests by VIPs for Papal audiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the Church as a major political player?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: No, although individual Christian Democratic Party leaders were devout
                    Catholics. Aldo Moro was kidnaped at a church. He went to Mass every morning.
                    Aldo Moro was the leader of the largest faction on the left in the Christian
                    Democratic Party.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Q: I know down in Naples in the Mezzogiorno, I would go to church services,
                    usually commemorations of this or that, and I would often find myself standing
                    next to the representatives of the Communist Party. We all showed up and heard
                    the Mass.</p>
                <p>WARD: One of my memories of Italian churches on Sunday were the women going into
                    the church and the men standing outside talking about soccer and smoking
                    cigarettes. It's curious. The church played a significant social role, but a
                    limited religious one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '79. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I went to Harvard for a year. I had always been interested in systems
                    analysis. The Department at the time had a mid-career university training
                    program in systems analysis, which had up to then been used to train
                    administrative officers. I wanted to look at applications of analytical
                    techniques and computers on the political side. I became the first political
                    officer to be designated for this program. The Department wanted me to go to
                    MIT's Center for Advanced Engineering Studies. I remember trying to convince the
                    Department that since I had never been through basic engineering, the Center for
                    Advanced Engineering Studies was the wrong place for me. I argued that I could
                    really accomplish what I wanted to do much better at Harvard's Kennedy School,
                    which had a very liberal policy of allowing cross-registration with MIT and
                    other area universities. Dick Gardner helped me convince the Department that I
                    should go to the Kennedy School. There was not an official concentration system
                    within the master's of public administration program at the Kennedy School, but
                    most of my courses were related to quantitative analysis. I also took systems
                    analysis courses at MIT. I took a lot of statistics, microeconomics, and
                    operations research at Harvard.</p>
                <p>Q: This was pretty early on in the computer age. The State Department had moved
                    from the quill pen to the manual typewriter to maybe the electric typewriter by
                    this time.</p>
                <p>WARD: When I was in the Secretariat, we had one typewriter that worked with punch
                    cards. There was only one secretary who could operate it. On those Kissinger
                    trips we did have an early model laptop computer. It was basically a very clumsy
                    word processor.</p>
                <p>Q: When I was in Korea, we were playing with the Magcard, but we were also
                    playing with the Wang. I was working with a teathis was '76-'7sent out from the
                    State Department to see if we could automate the visa system, but it was with
                    one screen. It was very early on. How did you see the systems analysis fitting
                    in to the political side of things at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WARD: This was a time before personal computers and before we had huge computing
                    power on every desk. At the most basic level, it seemed to me, we could use
                    computers for biographic reporting, keeping biographic files, and for analyzing
                    personalities and trends more efficiently. I also did a project that used a
                    computer-based simulation to model a national security issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was more a retrieval system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was not just retrieval. Looking at elections, you might use statistical
                    techniques to look at election outcomes. I think political sections have by and
                    large stopped predicting elections. But this was a time when political sections,
                    at least the one in Rome, were still expected to have a view on what would
                    happen in the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you got marks back in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: And it struck me at the time that we probably could do a better job of
                    using some statistical methods than simply saying, “Well, I think the Christian
                    Democrats are going to get 37.5%.” That was one side of it.</p>
                <p>The other side was interest in using techniques of statistical analysis and
                    operations research to understand political-military subjects better,
                    specifically arms control issues and strategic issues. So those were the main
                    things that I concentrated on during my year at Harvard, which was a fantastic
                    year. I even had time to train for and complete three marathons during the
                    year.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, this was a period where even historians were getting into the computer
                    business. They were going down and looking at the county vote in Frederick
                    County in 1830. It was very much on the way. Somehow or another, if you've got
                    enough data and it could be analyzed, you could discover how to make gold.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WARD: Right. For one of my projects at Harvard, I did a so-called Monte Carlo
                    simulation. It was called Monte Carlo because it used random number concepts. At
                    the time, the Committee on the Present Danger, whose most visible spokesman was
                    Paul Nitze, was warning that the Russians with their SS-18 missiles were
                    widening the so-called missile gap, which may not have existed under Kennedy but
                    probably did under Carter, and that they were dangerously close to reaching a
                    first-strike capability against our missiles. Nitze contended that in a first
                    strike, the SS-18 missiles might be able to destroy all of our land-based
                    intercontinental ballistic missiles. My project was to test the probability of
                    that assertion using a Monte Carlo simulation. The project used a standard
                    equation for assessing the so-called kill probability of a ballistic missile
                    against a hard missile silo. It involved various factors, including the yield of
                    a warhead, the hardness of the shelter, something called the circular error
                    probable of the missile system and other variables. My professor, Richard
                    Zeckhauser, suggested that, since all of the factors that were plugged into the
                    equation were actually estimates, that I should undertake a simulation in which
                    all of those factors would vary on a random basis. I could then run through one
                    thousand simulated missile strikes and see where we came out. I thought that was
                    an elegant design. Fortunately or unfortunately, it turned out that the
                    simulation actually validated what Nitze was saying, that there was a high
                    probability that the Russians, in fact, probably could have destroyed our
                    missiles in a first strike. We did that simulation with punch cards. Today, it
                    probably wouldn't be a worthwhile project because you could do it on a personal
                    computer in hours. Then, it took a tremendous amount of work and learning about
                    programming languages.</p>

                <p>WARD: I really enjoyed my year there and I thought there were some people at the
                    Kennedy School who were connected with the real world. One of the things I do
                    now at the Institute of Peace is teach negotiation skills. The best lessons I've
                    ever learned about negotiation were with Howard Raiffa, a business school
                    professor who also taught at the Kennedy School, a man of tremendous academic
                    and real-world experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the Kennedy School was
                        differenfrom the groves of academia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Oh, yes. The rest of Harvard looked down and still looks dowon the Kennedy
                    School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're not part of the groves of academia mafia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: People at the Kennedy School tend to get their hands dirty in the real
                    world. Perhaps they do not publish as widely as some of those on the arts and
                    sciences faculty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On negotiation, what techniques did you pick up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were really two strains of negotiation theory at Harvard at the time.
                    Roger Fisher and his younger colleague, William Ury, who has since become quite
                    famous for his books about the practice of negotiations, represented one. Fisher
                    and Ury represented the interest-based approach to negotiation. The object of a
                    negotiation is to discover the underlying interest of your negotiating partner
                    and then work to find a win-win situation in which although the opening
                    positions of each side might not be realized, the underlying interests can be
                    accommodated. Then there is the Howard Raiffa approach. Raiffa would not reject
                    the interest-based approach of Roger Fisher, but he primarily looks upon
                    negotiation through the lens of game theory. It's a more quantitative approach,
                    more of a game-theory approach, but also looking for the possibilities of
                    finding win-win solutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '80. Where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The State Department personnel system said that I had to use my degree.
                    Before I went to Harvard, people from the European Bureau's NATO office
                    (EUR/RPM) - Charlie Thomas and Steve Ledogar contacted me. They wanted me to
                    come and work there. The central system did not want me to do that. They wanted
                    me to take a job that would show I was using systems analysis. The Bureau of
                    Political-Military Affairs had organized a new office. Assistant Secretary Les
                    Gelb wanted help in understanding the foreign affairs implications of DOD's
                    defense planning process. He started an office called the Office of Systems
                    Analysis. I went to work there. By the time I arrived, Reg Bartholomew had
                    replaced Gelb as assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>Q: You did this from when to when?</p>
                <p>WARD: I was there for a year from 1980-1981 when, with the Reagan administration,
                    Rick Burt took over the PM bureau and reorganized it. The Systems Analysis
                    Office was a very interesting place. There were only a couple of FSOs in that
                    office, the rest were Schedule B experts, a number of whom have made important
                    contributions in and outside government. Richard Clarke, for example, had been
                    at the NSC for years and is now in charge of the effort to protect our
                    infrastructure. David Ochmanek, who at the time was a Foreign Service officer,
                    became a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and is now at the Rand
                    Corporation. Arnold Kanter, later Under Secretary for Political Affairs, was the
                    deputy director of the office.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that this would be a rather crucial area. If somebody can put
                    things in quantitative terms, particularly when up against State Department
                    people, who don't think in these terms, you can say, “This is what the formula
                    says.”</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WARD: You're correct. Les Gelb wanted to have a group of people who could
                    understand DOD's quantitative techniques and, in a sense, help defend State's
                    interests. It was a defensive mechanism for the State Department. It worked to
                    some extent. This was a time when cruise missiles and intermediate-range
                    ballistic missiles were being developed. One of the issues was stationing of
                    cruise missiles in Italy. Having a group of people who understood what the
                    military was saying about these issues was very helpful to the State Department.
                    But after a year, I had to choose between being a deputy director in one of the
                    reorganized offices in the PM Bureau and going to work for Assistant Secretary
                    Eagleburger as his special assistant for policy in the European Bureau. After
                    some arm wrestling between the two bureaus, I went to the European Bureau via a
                    short assignment as Rick Burt's special assistant in the PM front office.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll do Eagleburger next time. The Reagan administration came in January 20,
                    1981. How did that hit the PM Bureau? Was there a house cleaning?</p>
                <p>WARD: As I mentioned, the office that I was in, the Office of Systems Analysis,
                    was staffed mainly by Schedule B employees. They were non-career experts. With
                    the new administration, they all were faced with the need to find other jobs.
                    Some of them stayed, but most of them went elsewhere. The Political-Military
                    Bureau gained clout in the Reagan administration. Rick Burt came in with Bob
                    Blackwill as his deputy. Jim Dobbins was an office director; Richard Haass was
                    another. They were a very strong team.</p>
                <p>Q: The short time you were working for Rick Burt, how did he operate? What was
                    his background? How did he come into the bureau as far as his attitude towards
                    the State Department?</p>
                <p>WARD: Rick was a former journalist. He was about my age. He had gone to Cornell
                    and then the Fletcher School. Then he spent some time in England at Oxford or
                    Cambridge before beginning work as an analyst at the International Institute for
                    Strategic Studies in London. He later became a reporter for the New York Times.
                    In PM, the joke was that the New York Times owned the assistant secretary-ship.
                    Les Gelb had also come from the Times to PM. Rick was a young, brash guy with a
                    lot of ideas, a lot of intellectual candlepower. As a bureau, PM didn't always
                    have tremendous bureaucratic clout. Its influence depended upon its leadership.
                    Gelb and Bartholomew did accumulate a lot of clout, and Burt wanted to maintain
                    that and, if possible, increase it. He was very active. However, he was not
                    particularly well organized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WARD: That was my job for a while. A year later, when Larry Eagleburger left the
                    European Bureau, who showed up as Assistant Secretary for European Affairs but
                    Rick Burt. Having deserted Burt's bureau a year earlier, this made me slightly
                    uneasy. Luckily, it was never held against me. When Rick came to the European
                    Bureau, he asked me to again spend some time as his executive assistant to
                    organize things. So I did that both in the Political-Military Bureau and in the
                    European Bureau. In the European Bureau, I traveled with Rick and got to know
                    him pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Political-Military Bureau was focused at the time on
                        armcontrol?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was heavily focused on arms control. During the time I was there, the
                    office of Systems Analysis was focused on both arms control and on the Persian
                    Gulf. I spent most of my time working on something called the Rapid Deployment
                    Force, the so-called RDF. That was 1980. The Carter Administration had an
                    eight-year plan that would have resulted by 1988 in a very sizeable military
                    capability for reinforcing the Persian Gulf. It was a fairly well thought-out
                    plan that later had to be speeded up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason for it was-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Iran. We focused on how to fight a campaign in Iran. How would you get
                    inland from the coastline of Iran if Iranian armor forces blocked the passes in
                    the Zagros Mountains? That was the military problem. The development of the RDF
                    was aimed at that problem. There were a lot of innovative things that began at
                    the time, for example, the idea of maritime pre-positioning ships and basing at
                    Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. A lot of work went into detailed planning, for
                    example, on how to utilize aircraft carriers in the shallow Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find your quantitative analysis helped?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It helped a bit. We sometimes used analytical tools such as decision trees
                    and matrix analysis. We did not undertake heavy mathematical analyses.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the Political-Military Bureau one where there was a lot of
                    thought? So much of our work in the State Department is responding to crises.
                    You can almost pick up the New York Times and Washington Post and know what
                    you're going to be doing that day.</p>
                <p>WARD: To a limited extent. It was also a place where there were a lot of tight
                    deadlines; a lot of papers that needed to be written for the Secretary. Both Reg
                    Bartholemew and Rick Burt were very action oriented.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point? We'll pick this up in 1981 when you're moving
                    over to the European Bureau and working for Larry Eagleburger.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is May 22, 2001. You were in the EUR Bureau from when to when?</p>
                <p>WARD: From the summer of 1981 until the summer of 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: For the first year, I was a special assistant for policy to Assistant
                    Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger. I worked for Mark Palmer, who had the title of
                    deputy for policy within the Bureau. Eagleburger had set up a small Policy
                    Office within his front office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1981. What were the matters of interest in European
                        affairs anwhat were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: In 1981, we were focused on the relationship with the Soviet Union and in
                    preparing the ground for the deployment of intermediate range nuclear
                    forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in response to the SS-20, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, we were also concerned to some extent with the Conference on Security
                    and Cooperation in Europe and tried to ensure a unified NATO position within
                    that conference. My role for that year, in addition to helping Mark Palmer write
                    policy papers, was as action officer for the Quadripartite Talks. This was a
                    very quiet forum for coordination among the principal members of the North
                    Atlantic Alliance the United States, Britain, France, and Germany. The “Quad”
                    talks began as a means to coordinate policy on Berlin, since Germany was
                    directly involved and Britain, France, and the United States were the occupying
                    Western Powers. But over the years, they expanded to include a much wider
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '81-'84. How were relations with the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This was after the invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WARD: It was a period of difficult relations with the Soviet Union. Not only were
                    we at odds over nuclear weapons and the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe,
                    but also we had the situation in Afghanistan and Soviet support of surrogate
                    nations in Africa and Latin America. There was also the problem of Soviet
                    mistreatment of minorities, especially Soviet Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel that the Soviet Union was on the move, was
                        beinaggressive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was a sense that the Soviet Union was dynamic and on the move in a
                    pretty hard-nosed way. In the same period, we saw tensions increase when Polish
                    PM Jaruzelski cracked down on the democratic labor movement in Poland,
                    Solidarity. There was also the question of the proffered supply of natural gas
                    by the Soviet Union to Western Europe and consideration of the Western Europeans
                    of building a natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union. We were opposed to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the beginning of the Reagan Administration. What
                        was your impression? Every time a new administration comes in, we take its
                        temperature. What was your feeling in European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I thought that in European affairs President Reagan appointed a very
                    capable team, with Larry Eagleburger at the helm. He only stayed for a fairly
                    short period of time as Assistant Secretary. He left in 1982 during a bout of
                    ill health. Eagleburger knew Europe very well and had the confidence of all the
                    major players in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you picking up about old things like the pipeline and how much the
                    Europeans were with us on things? Was there any disquiet about Reagan? He came
                    in talking a very hard-line policy that later changed.</p>
                <p>WARD: At the beginning of the Reagan Administration, there was palpable concern
                    on the part of our major European allies about the policies that the
                    administration would follow. I think that Larry Eagleburger played a very
                    important role in both allaying fears and at the same time promoting a much more
                    active European agenda than we had had in the previous administration. He
                    traveled almost constantly within Europe. I would often travel with him. I
                    remember once asking him why he felt he needed to travel so much in Europe,
                    shuttling literally from capital to capital. His answer was to the effect that
                    the Europeans needed him as a sort of baby pacifier, someone who could explain
                    policy clearly and provide reassurance. He did that at great personal sacrifice
                    because it was exhausting and he had various health concerns.</p>
                <p>Q: Often when there is a certain amount of tension, the French seem to distance
                    themselves. Were the French a little hard to keep on the team?</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WARD: Certainly within the Quadripartite group and also in conversations over
                    issues such as the Soviet natural gas pipeline, the French were often the last
                    to come on board and sometimes never came on board. Their positions in the area
                    of arms control were very interesting. On the one hand, the French at a very key
                    moment stood up for the deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe.
                    At the same time, in the field of conventional arms control, they had stood
                    aside from the MBFR talks, and they resisted proposals for a new forum for
                    conventional arms control in Europe.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it obvious that the conjunction of Ronald Reagan in Washington and
                    MargareThatcher in Great Britain was bringing the British and the Americans
                    closer together?</p>
                <p>WARD: Certainly there was excellent coordination of policy with London. This was
                    a very busy time in many ways. There were a lot of issues on the table and a lot
                    going on in the world, including the war in the Falklands. The British
                    government was a bit taken aback by the initial stance taken by Secretary Haig,
                    who I think was in Cairo when the war started. He made a statement that sounded
                    to the British a lot like “equidistance” between Britain and Argentina. That
                    changed rather rapidly. But in all, the conflict brought us even closer
                    together.</p>
                <p>Q: How were we viewing the CSCE at that time? Later, it turned into quite a
                    powerful instrument for bringing about changes in the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                <p>WARD: Initially, America had been skeptical of it and agreed to CSCE only as a
                    way to launch MBFR. But I think we discovered early on in the process during the
                    1970s that, in fact, CSCE offered an excellent opportunity to hold the Soviet
                    Union accountable to its human rights commitments under the Helsinki Final Act.
                    In 1981, I moved on from the job as special assistant for policy to the
                    Assistant Secretary to become head of the political section in the Office of
                    European Security and Political Affairs, which is basically the NATO and CSCE
                    office. My responsibility included CSCE, so I backstopped Ambassador Max
                    Kampelman, who was our negotiator. In my opinion, Max was a superb negotiator.
                    He masterfully held together the NATO coalition, forged excellent ties within
                    the Neutral and Non-Aligned [NNA] group, and used the instrument of the Helsinki
                    Final Act to hold the Soviet Union accountable. Over time we made a lot of
                    progress on human rights issues in the Soviet Union by coordinating what Max was
                    doing at the table in Madrid, where the CSCE talks were, with our bilateral
                    demarches in Moscow and conversations that the President and the Secretary of
                    State had with their counterparts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Alexander Haig as Secretary of State perceived?
                        Later,he got into outs with the court around Ronald Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WARD: Secretary Haig was in office for a fairly brief period. It was a year or
                    so. He saw himself as a man of action. He surrounded himself with some very
                    talented people. Because he was there so briefly and I was so junior, I really
                    didn't see him in action that much. My memory of the '80s is dominated by the
                    figure of George Shultz, who took over from Secretary Haig. Shultz was a giant
                    among secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Yugoslavia come up during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It did. It came up in several ways, very unlike the ways in which
                    Yugoslavia comes up these days. At the time, we were quietly within the
                    Quadripartite group consulting over means of supporting the Yugoslav government
                    vis-�-vis the Soviet Union. There were some very sensitive long-term commitments
                    by the United States and other major allies on the military security of
                    Yugoslavia. There were programs of assistance.</p>
                <p>Q: The concern was that with an aggressive Soviet Union, with the demise of Tito
                    and a weakened government, this might bring about the Soviets messing around in
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>WARD: That's right. Of course, Eagleburger, having recently beeambassador in
                    Belgrade, was very interested in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other issues that you had to deal
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: In addition to arms control and CSCE and the crackdown on Poland and the
                    Soviet pipeline, I worked on the day-to-day NATO issues, things like organizing
                    ministerial meetings, which happened twice a year, and backstopping NATO
                    political committee meetings. But the major issues were arms control, the
                    deployment of intermediate range nuclear weapons, and CSCE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling of where arms control was
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Arms control was in a very active period. I was less involved with
                    strategic arms control than with our theater nuclear and conventional arms
                    control work. It was a period in which, on the intermediate range issues, the
                    stage was being set for what became a successful negotiation eventually. The
                    deployment, which provided essential leverage for the negotiation, was also
                    being carried forward in a very difficult atmosphere. There were very large
                    protests in Germany and elsewhere over the deployment of these missilealso in
                    Britain and Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Germany as a major ally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WARD: The Germans were extremely important and felt extremely exposed. They felt
                    themselves on the frontlines. They were at the time very concerned that the
                    increase in tensions would result in a conflict on their soil. More than any
                    other ally, they had to deal day-to-day with the reality that a conflict would
                    end with the extinction of their country. So, more than any ally, they were
                    sensitive to every security issue. They needed a good deal of handholding, a
                    good deal of reassurance, constant consultations, and above all they had a great
                    thirst for information about what we were doing. One of the reasons Eagleburger
                    was so successful was that he was able to provide that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Burt came in, was he able to continue the
                        networking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Rick Burt continued in that tradition. He had a different stylsometimes
                    more abrasive and confrontational, but he continued very constant consultations.
                    That was a formula for success in the European Bureau throughout the 1980s. We
                    had a succession of people at the helm that did rather well in that job with
                    very different styles. I'm thinking of Larry Eagleburger and then Rick Burt and
                    Roz Ridgway, who did a superb job in both managing the bureau and managing the
                    relationship with Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Soviet side fit with the Western European side
                        in thbureau? Were these two distinct cultures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was rivalry between the NATO office and the Soviet Affairs office. It
                    was almost always a friendly rivalry, perhaps not 100% of the time because both
                    offices were fast moving places and frictions did arise. There was a lot of
                    talent in both offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there ever any clashes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were clashes of view especially in the area of strategic arms
                    control, which was not an area that I worked on. There, the Soviet Affairs
                    office had the lead for the bureau, and yet we in the NATO office felt that we
                    also had a voice. We felt they were inclined to lobby for excessive
                    accommodation of the Soviet position. They probably believed that we wanted to
                    spend excessive time on Alliance coordination. There were other difficultiethe
                    clearance process, papers for NATO, and so forth. Sometimes, as always in the
                    State Department bureaucracy, one had the feeling that more than one office was
                    being tasked with responsibility for the same issue, and coordination was a bit
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the NSC play much of a role at your level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WARD: The NSC played a very important role. I can never remember significant
                    difficulties with the NSC on NATO issues. There were great divergences with the
                    Department of Defense and Richard Perle's team, especially on intermediate range
                    nuclear arms control. A number of quite hard-line individuals on Perle's staff
                    did not seem to want the INF talks to succeed. We tended to see deployment as a
                    means of achieving the so-called “zero option,” or elimination of all INF
                    weapons. DoD treated deployment as an end in itself.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any feeling at this point that the Soviets might be stretching
                    themselves too thin and might not be able to sustain a competition with the
                    United States?</p>
                <p>WARD: That came later. After a brief period in Bonn, I had a second tour in the
                    NATO office, this time as Deputy Director. The fault lines in the USSR began to
                    appear then, when it became clear that they were paying a very high price in
                    Afghanistan. Of course, that price was raised by some of the activities we
                    undertook in support of the Afghan opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this job until '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Then I went to Bonn as the chief of the Internal Political Unit. We
                    had a very large political section in Bonn that was divided up into a number of
                    small pieces. One was the Internal Affairs Unit. We did exactly what that
                    connotes. We followed German internal politics. I watched over the Social
                    Democrats and the Greens. My colleague, J.D. Bindenagel, looked after the
                    Christian Democrats and the Liberals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I was only there for a little more than a year. Our ambassador was Arthur
                    Burns, a grand old man who became one of the most recognized and influential men
                    in Germany. He was devoted to his job. He worked very long hours because he
                    really loved, almost more than anyone I've ever observed, the intellectual
                    stimulus of work. He was a very effective ambassador and was really loved by the
                    embassy staff. We had a capable political section. Richard Barkley was the
                    political counselor. Tom Weston was the deputy political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What party was in power in this period, '84-'85?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WARD: Chancellor Kohl and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union
                    were in power in coalition with the Liberals. Kohl had been elected in 1982.
                    When he was first elected, it was very much similar to the kind of thing we
                    recently went through with President George W. Bush and also some of the early
                    thoughts about President Reagan. Was this man intellectually capable to hold the
                    office? In all three cases, they proved their detractors wrong pretty early.
                    Kohl jokes were rampant in Germany. You could buy joke books about the
                    Chancellor, which was unusual in a country that respected authority. Later,
                    during Unification, Kohl proved himself to be the single politician in Germany
                    who understood at a deep level what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were looking at the Social Democrats, the Liberals,
                        and thGreens. What was our reading on the Social Democrats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: They were terribly divided between Atlanticists and more left-wing figures
                    in the party. Slowly, over time, the Atlanticists were gaining ground, but they
                    were bedeviled by the tendency of some in the SPD to turn leftward in order to
                    counter the growing Green Party. To the extent that the Social Democrats moved
                    toward the center, the Greens would occupy the left. The Greens were a chaotic
                    party, a party that was fun to cover because they were so chaotic. The party was
                    composed of many factions. When you'd go to a Greens convention, you'd find dogs
                    running around, kids running around, women sitting on the floor and knitting,
                    agendas disregarded, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a student movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was very much a young people's movement. The Greens began an
                    environmental protest party. A much harder line, truly Marxist element, people
                    who had come out of Marxist splinter parties, later infiltrated them. There was
                    tension between those two wings within the Party. Eventually, over a long period
                    of time, the more moderate wing prevailed. Said another way, radical figures
                    became over time more moderate. I remember that Joshka Fischer, now foreign
                    minister, was photographed during the '70s beating a policeman during a
                    demonstration. When I knew Fischer in the '84-'85 period, it was already clear
                    that he was very realistic about the place of Germany in Europe, about Germany's
                    need for security. He was one of those Greens who in a quiet moment, perhaps
                    after a couple of beers, would admit that Germany had a role in NATO despite the
                    fact that the platform of the Greens party was very definitely for German
                    withdrawal from the Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern that agents of the Soviet Union, of
                        EasGermany, had pretty well infiltrated the Green Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>WARD: There certainly were within the Green Party people who had been influenced
                    by Marxist ideology. I don't recall a special concern about agents within the
                    Green Party, although later it emerged that there were East German agents just
                    about everywhere, including in the American mission.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we concerned at the time that at some point, the Soviets and East Germans
                    might come up with a deal, saying, “Maybe you can unite if you, West Germany,
                    and you, East Germany, get out of NATO?”WARD: That sort of idea was present in
                    the background, enough to be of some concern to us. During the unification saga,
                    it turned out that there were some German leaders, perhaps even Foreign Minister
                    Genscher, who might have been willing to compromise on the question of a unified
                    Germany's position in NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Liberals fit into the scheme of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Liberals were the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Hans Dieterich Genscher,
                    who was the most popular politician in Germany, headed the FDP. The Liberals
                    were always threatened by the possibility that they could fall below the five
                    percent minimum of the popular vote needed for representation in the Bundestag.
                    The Liberals were also split between a left and a right wing. More or less
                    traditional 19th century liberals dominated the party, but others were further
                    to the left. Genscher became the longest serving foreign minister in German
                    history and was the absolute master of the foreign office. He ran the ministry
                    quite autocratically. He knew everybody because he had been minister for so
                    long. He made even small decisions himself. His stewardship produced a
                    generation of German diplomats who were very cautious because they knew that
                    their chief wanted to call all the shots. They were quite cautious and operated
                    within much narrower limits than the British or French that I observed in the
                    Quadripartite Talks.</p>

                <p>WARD: Chuck Redman, who became Deputy Director of the Office of European Security
                    and Political Affairs in the Department in 1984, was moved up in 1985 to become
                    deputy spokesman of the Department. Chuck of course went on to much greater
                    things, but his departure left the office without a Deputy Director in a very
                    busy period. Charlie Thomas and Ray Caldwell asked me to come back to be the
                    Deputy Director. Because I was so interested in the substance of what that
                    office did and in the larger issues, I agreed to do that. I received a “directed
                    assignment,” cutting short my time in Bonn.</p>

                <p>WARD: Deputy Director of the Office of European Security anPolitical Affairs, the
                    NATO office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from '85 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: From '85-'88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, what were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The issues were those of security and arms control. The Conference on
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe had moved into a new phase in which it was
                    considering mandates for new negotiations on both human rights and arms control.
                    The mutual and balanced force reduction negotiations (MBFR) after years and
                    years had gone basically nowhere. We were discussing with our NATO allies a new
                    arms control forum that would eventually emerge from CSCE and become known as
                    the Conventional Forces in Europe negotiation, CFE. It would consider all NATO
                    and Warsaw Pact forces from the Atlantic to the Urals. One of the defects of
                    MBFR was that the zone of negotiation was much too small. France did not
                    participate in MBFR. So, we wanted as a counterpart to the INF talks to have a
                    Conventional Forces negotiation that included everything from the Atlantic to
                    the Urals. That we felt was the proper unit for negotiation. The main problem
                    would be to negotiate a mandate with the Soviet Union, but even before we could
                    begin that task, we needed to bring the French on board. Much of my time during
                    my first year back in Washington was taken up with working with Steve Ledogar,
                    who then was the deputy chief of mission at U.S. NATO, and with Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary Charlie Thomas in moving toward a mandate for those talks. I remained
                    responsible for the Quadripartite Talks during much of that period, and we used
                    that forum to negotiate a mandate for CFE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would the French be so concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WARD: Initially, the French rejected any limitations on their forces. They were
                    quite happy to see U.S., German, and UK forces included in an arms control
                    arrangement. Another factor was the fact that the French were not part of the
                    integrated military structure of NATO, so they felt that since they were not in
                    NATO, they shouldn't be counted within NATO military limits vis-�-vis the Warsaw
                    Pact. In fact, one of the difficulties in working out the terms of the
                    negotiation with the French was how we would go about accounting for French
                    forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't as though the French had that overwhelming a
                        force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: They didn't have an overwhelming force, but they had a substantial force.
                    The French military budget stayed pretty robust during a period in which there
                    was always a lot of pressure on the German budget and also on the British
                    budget. This was a time when arms budgets were not declining; they were
                    expanding, in part because of U.S. pressure to maintain three percent annual
                    real growth in defense expenditures. We pushed in a determined way for real
                    growth in defense budgets throughout the alliance. It was a period when our
                    expenditures as a percentage of GNP at times approached five percent. The
                    Germans were hugging three. The French and British were a little above
                    three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Italians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: One of the sensitivities of the Quadripartite Talks, the Berlin Talks as we
                    called them, was that the Italians were excluded, and they resented that fact.
                    It sometimes seemed to me that it meant more to the Italians to be there than to
                    do much in terms of policy contributions. It reminded me of the Woody Allen
                    movie, Being There. On the other hand, Italy was a staunch ally in terms of
                    deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces, and certainly occupied a
                    strategic position on the Mediterranean. They were sometimes excluded because
                    they failed to exploit politically their material contributions to the Alliance.
                    Britain consistently “punched above its weight” in the Alliance. If anything,
                    the Italians punched below theirs. Italy's contribution to the alliance at the
                    time was substantial. They were providing many bases. They were supporting the
                    INF deployment. And yet influence eluded them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always very difficult to deal with the Italian
                        government.Wasn't this part of the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WARD: When I was in Italy, we used to say that despite the fact that Italy had
                    had 40 or so governments since World War II, it was the most politically stable
                    country in Europe. In 1979, Giulio Andreotti was Prime Minister. He had been a
                    junior minister in the second Gaspari government after World War II in 1948. So,
                    he had been in the government then for 30 years and eventually stayed much
                    longer. The same party, the Christian Democrats, led every government. But the
                    focus was so often inward and not outward. Because of that, their influence
                    within the alliance was often diminished. At NATO ministerial meetings, we would
                    divide up responsibilities for taking notes for the Secretary during his
                    bilateral conversations with other foreign ministers. My memory of many of those
                    conversations with other major leaders of the alliance is that they focused on
                    the large issues. In contrast, the conversations with the Italians were often
                    about minutiae, and sometimes basically about the Italians' sense of
                    inferiority, of being left out. One extreme example was a conversation between
                    Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Andreotti. Andreotti began by alleging
                    that there had not been a large enough Italian-American representation at the
                    ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. Remember, this
                    took place at a time when some pretty big issues were on the table in the
                    Alliance. The Soviet threat seemed very real. Despite this, Andreotti spent a
                    great deal of time dwelling on a tiny issue. It was one of the iciest diplomatic
                    conversations I have ever witnessed. At one point after Andreotti finished his
                    lengthy presentation, Secretary Shultz said, “Do you have anything else to talk
                    about today?” I and other people in the room thought that Shultz was on the
                    point of walking out. He made no attempt to conceal his exasperation with his
                    Italian colleague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Spain and Portugal? Did they play much of a
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: This was the period in which Spain was entering the Alliance. Spain played
                    a very important role from the beginning. They quite clearly took the Alliance
                    very seriously. In contrast to France, which did not visibly make an effort to
                    find ways to integrate itself militarily and instead obliged the alliance to put
                    together jury-built secretive military relationships, the Spanish government,
                    although it did not enter the military structure right off, made clear it wanted
                    to do that eventually, that it wanted as close a military relationship as the
                    political traffic within Spain would bear. From the start, they made a very
                    concrete and effective contribution to the Alliance, a striking effort by the
                    Spanish socialists, who only a few years before had been stridently anti-NATO.
                    Portugal played a relatively small role in NATO political negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Belgium? The Netherlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Dutch were very solid, often providing a measure of calm and good
                    sense. Belgium and Holland were deployment countries for the intermediate range
                    nuclear forces. They handled it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is quite a political challenge to these
                        countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was a heavy challenge in all the deployment countries. It was the
                    dominant issue. At the end of the day, the Europeans came through. NATO
                    follow-through on the INF deployment track gave our negotiators a great deal of
                    leverage. NATO had a decent alternative to a negotiated agreement.</p>
                <p>Q: All this deployment business was a result of the Soviets moving their SS-20
                    missiles there and telling the Europeans, “Get away from the Americans because
                    you're under threat now and the Americans can back off while we blast you.” It
                    was basically a political move on the part of the Soviets.</p>
                <p>WARD: It was a political-military move meant to drive a wedge withithe
                    Alliance.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling about the Soviets? Things were really moving on security
                    measures, human rights, and arms control. Were we feeling changes?</p>
                <p>WARD: Very definitely. In contrast to the early 1980s, when East-West
                    relationships were so difficult, by 1986 things had begun to move, even though
                    progress was uneven. We moved in 1986 toward a mandate for conventional arms
                    control. Those talks began. They moved quite swiftly. There was progress on
                    human rights within the CSCE forum. Emigration of Soviet Jews increased. The
                    Soviets responded sometimes to the lists of human rights problems that we
                    presented to them. The shoot-down of Korean Airlines flight 007 was a big
                    setback, but at least there were no subsequent, similar incidents.
                    Liberalization began in Poland, and there were palpable changes in most of the
                    Eastern Bloc countries. There were many factors at work, but two were
                    particularly important. First, the Soviets began to realize that they could not
                    keep pace with the West economically and therefore would eventually fall behind
                    militarily. Secondly, Soviet difficulties in Afghanistan were growing. And of
                    course there were some fairly rapid-fire changes in Soviet leadership. One began
                    to hear that the Soviets had been burned so badly by their experience in
                    Afghanistan that they would be less ready to use military force in supporting
                    other members of the Warsaw Pact in the future. That proved to be true in
                    Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I left the European Bureau in 1988 because I was assigned to the Senior Seminar,
                    which was a wonderful year. At the conclusion of my seminar year, Ambassador
                    Vernon (Dick) Walters asked me to be his DCM in Bonn. I met with him for the
                    first time as DCM-designate on April 7, 1989. He had called me and said, “Come
                    on over and let's talk about Germany.” I went over from FSI to his office in the
                    Department. He was then leaving the job as ambassador to the United Nations, so
                    he was still in a suite of offices on the sixth floor. He sat me down and said,
                    “George, we're going to go to Germany at a very interesting time. The Berlin
                    Wall's going to come down.” In April 1989, that was an astounding statement. No
                    one was saying that sort of thing. The conventional wisdom within the Foreign
                    Service “German club,” of which I was not really a member, was that German
                    reunification would take place, but only over a long period of time in which
                    there would be convergence of systems. Walters didn't subscribe to that. He
                    said, “It's almost over.” He believed that in withdrawing from Afghanistan
                    Gorbachev was also deciding that the Soviet Union would no longer provide
                    military support to its allies within the Warsaw Pact if those governments ran
                    into domestic unrest. Sure enough, Walters was right and the Wall did come
                    down.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to the time you were still within European Affairs, 1985-1988, what
                    readings were you getting about the crackdown in Poland? Was this seen as a new
                    toughening or a sign of weakness?</p>
                <p>WARD: Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement continued to gather strength in
                    Poland throughout the second half of the 1980s. Elections in 1989 left General
                    Jaruzelski no choice but to appoint Walesa's choice as prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If nothing else, the fact that Poland sits on top of all
                        the lines of communication for the Soviets, unless they're willing to go all
                        out to hold onto Poland, they don't have a credible threat to the West.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WARD: I wouldn't go that far. The Soviets had so much military strength based in
                    East Germany that they did have a credible conventional threat. We saw that
                    later when the Wall came down, and we had access to both records and
                    installations within East Germany. They might not have achieved all their
                    campaign objectives in quite the time they intended, but they had a very large
                    military force ready to go on very short notice. Key units were ready to go into
                    the field within hours or even minutes. What the effective loss of Poland did do
                    was to deny the Soviet Union the reinforcement capability that they would have
                    needed to get all the way to the Atlantic in a week or so as they planned. But
                    they could have devastated West Germany. Their war plans for West Germany were
                    such that they had stationmasters appointed for every railroad station in West
                    Germany. They had sandbox reconstructions of German cities. They had plans for
                    occupation that were well worked out. They had many divisions in which the
                    equipment was better maintained than the people. In at least one armored
                    division, their tanks were kept uploaded with both weapons and fuel, which is a
                    very dangerous practice. The tanks were kept in heated warehouses. They would
                    have been able to deploy very quickly. The men were housed in unheated barracks
                    and had the opportunity for one cold shower once a week. In the workers'
                    paradise, machines were treated better than people.</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WARD: My gut feeling, to be quite honest, was that he was wrong. I didn't see
                    change happening that fast. Germans of my generation were expressing great
                    doubts about speedy unification. They saw financial problems, economic problems.
                    They were, as Germans often are, very self-absorbed. They were absorbed with
                    their own problems. They were reluctant to see West Germany taking on the
                    responsibility for uniting the country. Plus, early on, there were few
                    indications that much was happening inside East Germany, although that changed
                    very quickly as the old order in Hungary and Czechoslovakia began to come apart.
                    Then you saw in the summer and early fall of 1989 peaceful protests. You saw
                    East Germans fleeing the country to get to Hungary, to get to Czechoslovakia.
                    You saw East Germans flooding into West German embassies in Hungary and
                    Czechoslovakia and the East German government finally relenting and allowing
                    those people to have passage through to the West. The pace of change
                    accelerated. In August 1989, Ambassador Walters was interviewed by one of the
                    German radio networks and was asked if he could foresee unification of Germany
                    within five years. He gave a very short answer, saying basically, “Yes, I can
                    foresee that because the Gorbachev government is no longer willing to support
                    its allies in other Warsaw Pact countries.” Washington perceived that statement
                    as too forward leaning. Secretary James Baker was reportedly unhappy with
                    Walters, and Walters did not get much support in the front office of the
                    European Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Bonn, were developments in Eastern
                        Europengulfing the whole operation of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It's a big embassy. The mission included many hundreds of Americans in
                    several locations throughout Germany. Lots of things were happening. But
                    certainly on the political side, developments that had to do with the so-called
                    “German question” soon became dominant. It was a very exciting time. It was a
                    great time to be in Germany, a great time to be DCM in Bonn. Things just
                    accelerated beginning almost from the time I got there through 1989.</p>
                <p>Q: As East Germans were fleeing out of the country and going to Czechoslovakia
                    and Hungary, was there concern that this is all great, but all of a sudden, the
                    East German government may come down very hard and no matter what the Soviet
                    Union does and we might have real fighting in the streets in Berlin and it would
                    be hard to restrain West Germans from going to help? This had been the scenario
                    since 1953.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WARD: There was such a concern. In fact, the East Germans did use repressive
                    force against demonstrations in some instances. But at a deeper level, events
                    were making the possibility of a Soviet intervention less and less likely.
                    Gorbachev's major priority was to reform the Soviet system at least to the
                    extent necessary for economic survival. By the time Gorbachev visited East
                    Berlin for an anniversary day in 1989, the tide had turned. Gorbachev told
                    Honecker that the Soviet Union would not intervene to settle East German
                    problems. Looking back, that policy statement has to be seen as a key one. At
                    that point, East Germany was alone. They knew better than we did just how weak
                    they were. The East German economy was a shell.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Everybody thought it was much better than it really was, maybe because
                    they were doing well in contrast to the rest of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                <p>WARD: At one point, East Germany was rated as the seventh largest industrial
                    power in the world. When the Wall came down, and we could see what East Germany
                    was really like, there was very little within East Germany that was economically
                    useful. We cooperated with the Germans in a very large-scale program aimed at
                    privatizing and selling off industrial resources in East Germany to those who
                    were willing to buy them and modernize them. The embassy's commercial and
                    economic sections did a tremendous job in publicizing these opportunities, and
                    there were some American firms that stepped in and bought at bargain basement
                    prices various facilities. But there were few real going concerns, companies
                    that could be productive from day one. There were a couple of exceptionthe Zeitz
                    optical works at Jena in Thuringia thrived almost from the beginning. But the
                    automobile plants, the large steel plants, and other large industrial
                    installations were worth only their scrap value. It turned out that I was able
                    in this period to begin to visit relatives that I had in East Germany, where my
                    grandmother had been born. It seemed to me that many of the horror stories that
                    we had heard about what life had been like under a communist system were true.
                    Industrial pollution was incredible. One relative, a second cousin, in East
                    Germany was basically disabled because of industrial pollution. Environmental
                    and safety problems in East German plants were the rule. The Bonneville Company
                    was looking at buying some East German power plants. I talked with an engineer
                    who went through these plants. He said, “From a safety point of view, any U.S.
                    utility would have had to have closed those power plants. At one point, there
                    was a hole in the floor without a fence around it, where you would have fallen
                    into an open furnace.” There was no effective environmental protection. The
                    environmental hazards and workers' safety hazards were criminal.</p>
                <p>Q: When you think about the disaster that that whole system was... As things were
                    developing in the Eastern Bloc, were we on high alert? Was there a point where
                    we said, “Hey, this is it?”</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WARD: Not in a military sense. I don't recall at any point our being seriously
                    alarmed about the possibility of conflict. There was a tense moment a couple of
                    days after the opening of the Wall, when the Soviet Union approached us through
                    the Berlin Group and asked for a meeting of the four powers in the Kommandatura
                    building in Berlin. There had not been a four-power meeting in that building
                    over forty years, so great symbolism was involved, memories of the occupation.
                    The Soviets stated to us that they were concerned that unrest in Eastern Germany
                    would threaten the security of their stationed forces. Walters, after consulting
                    with the Department and after a great deal of thought, made the decision to go
                    forward with the meeting. The four allied ambassadors met in Berlin. The German
                    government was very angry about this. They felt that at a time when Germany was
                    being liberated, when Germany was pointing toward unification, when the
                    sovereignty of Germany was emerging for the first time in almost 50 years, this
                    meeting symbolized the past. There was a photo taken of the four ambassadors on
                    the steps of the Kommandatura building. It was published on the front page of
                    many newspapers. One German foreign office type said to me, “Look at these four
                    old men. They symbolize the past. They're as tired as the past.” It was a
                    judgment call on our part. At the time, we were the only one of the four powers
                    to have doubts about the wisdom of the meeting. Even the British and French
                    valued that gathering as an assertion of the allied role in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of the meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Soviets were making noises that they were afraid things were going to
                    get out of hand. Harry Gilmore, our very capable minister in Berlin, told us
                    that his Soviet contacts there were very nervous. In Germany as a whole, our
                    forces did not feel the threat had increased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had these Russian troops, a major army, sitting
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: You had a major army with a lot of modern weapons manned by young and
                    increasingly disaffected Soviet soldiers. It was an unstable situation. So we
                    agreed to have the meeting, which was aimed at ensuring that the situation would
                    remain calm, that security would be maintained, and that the agreements among
                    allies would be carried out. It was the only meeting that took place. We didn't
                    agree to another. I think that Walters agreed to the meeting because he felt the
                    moment was particularly delicate and demanded a degree of support for Soviet
                    morale. Their world was, after all, coming apart. In the immediate aftermath of
                    the meeting, I thought that perhaps we had made a mistake. Later, I realized
                    that given the role the Soviets would have to play in German unification, it was
                    the right thing to do.</p>
                <p>Q: From the way it's described, it sounds like it made sense. It's not much fun
                    to have a major army sitting there with a population revolting against what you
                    stand for and to keep your troops in line and not somehow or other get
                    involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WARD: And the western allies were able to say, “Look, we don't have any military
                    designs in this situation. We want the situation to unfold peacefully,
                    democratically, and we don't have any intention of using our forces for anything
                    other than to protect the security of Berlin,” which was their traditional
                    role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good point to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is September 27, 2001. Why don't we talk a bit about Novembe1989. There had
                    been a meeting in the Kommandatura.</p>
                <p>WARD: Four Power meetings at the ambassadorial level had been suspended long ago.
                    The meeting in the Kommandatura went on for a couple of hours, and no concrete
                    agreements were reached. Everyone agreed that it was important to maintain peace
                    in and around Berlin and that military action should not be taken. But the
                    Soviets also used the meeting as a platform to reassert their role in Berlin.
                    The German officials interpreted the photograph of the Four-Power ambassadors
                    that was taken on the steps of the Kommandatura as a statement that change was
                    not welcome. In the case of the United States, nothing could have been further
                    from the truth. The United States and Ambassador Walters had made clear from the
                    start that we very much supported unification of Germany. That was not the case
                    for the other three powers. The reaction of the British and French at first was
                    that things were moving fast, perhaps too fact, that the implications of a
                    united Germany for Europe needed to be carefully considered, and that the
                    process should move fairly slowly. I don't think we disagreed with the analysis
                    that all of these questions needed to be considered very carefully, but we also
                    recognized that you can't slow history or people down, nor was that in our
                    interest. The British, despite what I understand to have been Margaret
                    Thatcher's quite marked hesitancy at the beginning, fairly rapidly came over
                    more toward our view of the situation. The French lagged considerably. Their
                    attitudes needed to be taken into account. Of course, the Soviet Union,
                    especially at the outset, was very interested in preserving East Germany as a
                    country that would somehow play a sovereign role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say there were some incidents when the Wall was
                        opening.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WARD: There was no significant violence. However, the western side of the Berlin
                    Wall was technically in East Germany. That is, when the East Germans built the
                    Wall, they built it on East German territory. So both sides of the Wall in a
                    technical sense were in the East. You had on the night of November 9-10 this
                    great flow across the Wall. Most of the East Berliners went back home that
                    night. People almost immediately began literally chipping away at the wall. The
                    next day and for a couple of days afterwards, we heard reports that perhaps the
                    East Germans would try to roll the opening back. The opening appears to have
                    occurred because of a misinterpretation of a district police official of a
                    decision by the East German leadership to liberalize foreign travel. The
                    district commander decided that the decision meant that anyone who wanted to
                    leave could do so immediately. The world should be grateful for this apparent
                    accident. In the days after November 10, the representatives of the western
                    powers in Berlin did take steps to try to avoid any incidents that might have
                    served as a pretext to roll back the opening. For example, at one point, the
                    western powers made an effort that turned out to be very half-hearted to stop
                    people from chipping away at the Wall because it was technically East German
                    property. It didn't have any real impact except perhaps on those officials and
                    their dependents who might otherwise have personally taken a sledgehammer to the
                    Wall. You can't stand against the tide of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were people in our mission doing? What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We were having the Marine birthday ball on November 9th and I learned about
                    the opening while we were at the Ball. Walters immediately wanted to go to
                    Berlin. It was his first instinct. In his memoir of his tenure as ambassador,
                    which was published in Germany but not in the United States, he relates that his
                    first thought was to go to Berlin. He decided to remain in Bonn on November
                    10th. I thought that was the right decision. At such a key moment, it was
                    important to have the ambassador available in Bonn. We didn't know exactly what
                    was happening. From Bonn, he could communicate with Washington, stay in contact
                    with the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister, provide advice, and be in
                    constant touch with our very capable team in West Berlin. By November 11th,
                    Walters could no longer resist the urge to be part of history, and left Bonn for
                    Berlin. By then, the situation was a little clearer. He was moved by what he saw
                    happening in Berlin. He tells a story that is quite interesting and evocative of
                    the mood of the times. Apparently, he got to Berlin and went to the
                    Friederichstrasse bridge, which is where many of the spy exchanges had taken
                    place, a bridge between East Berlin and West Berlin. There, he found a man from
                    Hamburg who had come to Berlin with a truckload of flowers. The man gave a
                    flower to every single person who crossed from the East to the West.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I can't stress enough the excellent job done by our Mission in West Berlin in
                    reporting on the situation and also in recommending steps necessary to prevent
                    any violence or misunderstandings between the East and West. Harry Gilmore
                    deserves a lot of credit for that. The embassy after the opening of the Wall
                    basically went into high gear and stayed there, not that we were on slow gear
                    before then, in order to support the negotiations that came to be known as the
                    “two-plus-four process.” That expression meant the four allied powers plus the
                    two Germanies. What evolved was a multi-tiered series of negotiations. Secretary
                    Baker did not seem to share at the outset Ambassador Walters's view that we
                    should do everything in our power to promote rapid German unification. Secretary
                    Baker clearly favored a more cautious approach. In retrospect, his approach was
                    wise in that the British, French, and, most especially, the Russians needed to
                    buy into a resolution of the situation. In addition to the major question of
                    German unity, you had a history of allied agreements over almost half a century
                    that needed to be revised or renegotiated. As I mentioned, the negotiations
                    included several tiers: heads of government, foreign ministers, then people like
                    Robert Zoellick, who was then the counselor of the State Department, and his
                    counterparts. Zoellick coordinated the policy effort in Washington and the
                    negotiations in the two-plus-four format. Bob Blackwill, who was senior director
                    at the NSC, also played an important role. Condoleeza Rice, who at the time
                    worked for Blackwill, was part of the team, as was Ray Seitz, Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs. Phil Zelikow, who teaches at a university, was
                    the junior member of the Washington-based two-plus-four team and later became
                    the historian of the process. At the time, he was a Foreign Service Officer
                    assigned to the NSC staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The role of the embassy during this time was to take the lead where it was
                    appropriate and to support the two-plus-four team otherwise. We took the lead on
                    issues such as status of forces. It quickly became clear that upon unification
                    Germany, it would be necessary to have a new Status of Forces agreement that
                    recognized German sovereignty. We also had the lead on some of the issues that
                    involved allied rights and practices in Berlin. We unilaterally suspended our
                    exercise of some allied rights almost immediately. The four-power rights in
                    Berlin were in theory very extensive, but in practice had diminished over the
                    decades. But even as late as 1989, they included various privileges that seemed
                    even then anachronistic, like free passes on the Berlin transportation system,
                    free shoe repair, fresh flowers in senior officer residences provided by the
                    Germans, etc. The Berlin police reported daily on police activities to the
                    public safety advisor at the United States mission and the other missions. The
                    German budget for allied expenses in Berlin was quite large. Walters immediately
                    saw that many of these practices were no longer appropriate and took immediate
                    steps to cut away many perquisites. On the more substantive side, there were
                    issues like control of civil aviation. As the situation began to evolve, it was
                    clear that airspace control procedures needed revision. For decades, flights
                    into and out of Berlin had been handled through an institution called the BASC
                    [Berlin Air Safety Center], which was a sort of paper-based air control center.
                    It consisted of four teams of military officers who sat around a table and
                    passed strips of paper between themselves to inform each other about flights
                    into and out of Berlin air space. It worked satisfactorily for many years, but
                    it was based on the system of four power rights. The western allies had come to
                    accept over the years a limitation not to fly above 10,000 feet. This was a
                    mistake that made for uncomfortable and inefficient air service once jets came
                    into use. We in the embassy took the lead on negotiations on civil aviation,
                    stationing and on some other subjects. I was the senior U.S. negotiator for the
                    initial status of forces talks and for civil aviation. Simultaneously, there
                    were negotiations going in capitals on the modalities for German unification.
                    The latter process was been well documented in books by Horst Teltschik,
                    Chancellor Kohl's national security adviser, and by Phil Zelikow and Condoleeza
                    Rice.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting from your German colleagues? Were they seeing a united
                    Germany? Were they concerned that this might cause greater problems? One of the
                    big concerns for us always has been that somehow or another the Soviets might
                    cut a deal where Germany would say, “Okay, we'll be united, but we'll be out of
                    NATO.”</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WARD: First of all, when rumblings of the crumbling of East Germany began to be
                    felt in West Germanbeginning in the spring and summer of 1989 you had streams of
                    refugees getting out of East Germany and going into Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and
                    from there into Western Germany I found among West Germans both in and out of
                    government widespread reluctance about and even opposition to the idea of
                    unification. Middle-class Germany was pretty comfortable and self satisfied.
                    Germans had grown used to the status quo. They felt that long-term processes
                    were headed in the right direction, and there was no reason to rush. Very few
                    people sensed the need for urgency. Fortunately, one of those who did was Helmut
                    Kohl. So, right after the fall of the Wall, you began to see within the German
                    government a division of opinion. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the brilliant and
                    politically adept chief of the Free Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, had led
                    the German foreign ministry for many years. Polls often showed him to be the
                    most popular politician in Germany. More than anyone else in the German
                    government, he was identified with the incremental policy, Ostpolitik, that
                    aimed at making the inner-German border meaningless over time in the context of
                    a united Europe. He saw the CSCE process as crucial. CSCE, which was basically
                    unknown in the U.S., was front-page news in Germany. At the outset, the foreign
                    ministry very much reflected Genscher's views and wanted to go slow. People at
                    the Foreign Ministry were also much more willing than the Chancellor was to
                    contemplate Germany changing its role in NATO or even leaving NATO. There were a
                    couple of indications in late 1989 that Genscher may have favored or at least
                    contemplated a neutral status for Germany. I don't think that Chancellor Kohl
                    ever considered such a position. Kohl's chief advisers, Horst Teltschik and
                    Peter Hartmann, were very solid.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we pressing and saying, “For God's sakes, fellows, stay in NATO?” Were we
                    pushing all the buttons we could within the German government to show that we
                    thought that a neutral Germany would be a disaster?</p>
                <p>WARD: Absolutely. Certainly the embassy represented that view and so did the
                    State Department. President Bush endorsed Ambassador Walters's approach in a
                    couple of hand-written letters. These letters were written, I believe, to
                    bolster Walters's morale at a time when the Ambassador was seriously considering
                    resigning because he felt that Secretary Baker had no confidence in him and was
                    cutting him out of the action. In those communications, Bush made it very clear
                    that he favored German unification only within the context of the western
                    alliance.</p>
                <p>Q: German unification within the context of the Western alliance was something
                    out of Oz. It came about. When you think about it, it certainly didn't look
                    particularly assured.WARD: That's right. And there probably were some on the
                    U.S. team who thought that it wouldn't happen that cleanly. Certainly our
                    embassy in East Berlin didn't. The analysis of our embassy in East Berlin, led
                    by Ambassador Dick Barkley, was that East Germany was a viable country that
                    should democratize, and that it would be in the interest of the West at least
                    for a while to preserve a functioning and democratic East Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>On the German side, let me give you one example of the way some Germans looked at
                    this process. Fairly early on, we started informal conversations between the
                    western troop stationing powers and the West German government on a new Status
                    of Forces agreement. The German principal representative in these conversations,
                    which were initially not formal negotiations, was the deputy legal advisor of
                    the German government, a man named Eitel, who was a good friend. Deputy chiefs
                    of mission and military representatives represented the eight Western troop
                    stationing states. In the first session of those talks, the German side
                    indicated that in the future when Germany became unified, members of western
                    forces would need visas to visit the five eastern states of Germany. This was a
                    position that horrified us. In fact, I could hardly believe what I was hearing.
                    I think a couple of things were at work in this very short-lived position. One
                    was that it was very difficult for people in the German foreign ministry, led by
                    Genscher, to believe that Germany really could be unified and not change its
                    status somehow within NATO. They were constantly thinking, “What price would we
                    pay to the Soviet Union?” Secondly, Germany expected some sort of concrete
                    acknowledgment by the troop stationing countries that Germany was really going
                    to be fully sovereign and that there would be no longer anything such as four
                    power rights and responsibilities. The direct demand for visas fell away very
                    quickly when: a) we reacted sharply to it, and b) we made very clear that we
                    understood Germany was going to be fully sovereign. The other part of it,
                    Germany's consciousness of the price that the Soviets would demand, was a theme
                    that lasted throughout these negotiations and in fact was reflected in the final
                    agreements. Indeed, in the final agreements, the western powers agreed that they
                    would not move their forces into the new Laender as military units; there would
                    be no stationing of NATO forces in the new states. Secondly, even official
                    visits by forces would need to be approved on a case-by-case basis. This
                    approval process became an inconvenience. Once Germany was unified, the first
                    thing every East German town wanted was a concert by a U.S. Army band. But the
                    U.S. Army band was not allowed to go to the five new Laender except on an
                    exceptional basis. We eventually worked out a special, streamlined approval
                    process for trips by Army bands to the former East Germany. Over time, approval
                    became semi-automatic. I have no idea what the status is today. I'm sure many of
                    these arrangements have changed. But the point of substance was that the German
                    foreign ministry was way behind others in one sense and ahead of others in
                    another sensbehind in recognizing that Germany was going to be unified, in
                    understanding where history was taking this country, but ahead of it in
                    understanding that you would have to pay a price to the Soviet Union. The price
                    paid to the Soviet Union turned out to be actually much lower than one might
                    have thought. The deal was arrived at through some very adroit diplomacy on the
                    part of Washington, Paris, and London, but also through the efforts of Kohl. The
                    Chancellor more than any other German understood that he was in an historical
                    sweet spot, that the external and internal factors were at the moment right for
                    unification. However, he knew that circumstances might change abruptly. So he
                    was willing both to pay a relatively high monetary price for unification. He
                    also made statements that were clearly overoptimistic but that perhaps needed to
                    be made at that time. I remember when he said, “In five years, there will be a
                    blooming economic landscape in eastern Germany.” It's been a lot more than five
                    years, and it's not quite blooming yet. But he created this sense of optimism.
                    He is a huge man physically. He created this dynamic image of optimism and
                    positive movement that permeated the country. Germany's left loved to denigrate
                    Kohl as a country bumpkin in much the same way that the American way criticized
                    President Reagan as a dim wit. The left was wrong in both cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Kohl moved prospects of unification forward considerably during his meetings with
                    Gorbachev in February 1990. They met in a dacha away from Moscow. Kohl and
                    Gorbachev had very long conversations in which Kohl indicated that he was
                    willing to provide very significant economic aid to the Soviet Union, and
                    Gorbachev ended by giving a green light to German unification within NATO. That
                    was a very important element of the deal that was closed in May or June, when
                    the Two-plus-Four agreements were signed. They were ratified sometime later. The
                    United States was the first country to ratify the Two-plus-Four Agreements. I
                    had the pleasure to go with Walters to hand Genscher the U.S. instrument of
                    ratification. It was an instance in which our Senate worked with remarkable
                    speed. Our ratification arrangements were more complicated than anyone else's,
                    and we got it done first. But the deal that Kohl and Gorbachev struck was
                    essential to the overall Two-plus-Four Agreements that produced German
                    unity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it was just getting together, what were the roles of
                        thBritish and the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The British and French weren't quite where we were at the beginning
                    certainly. Maggie Thatcher was reported as expressing deep reservations about
                    German unity. Clearly the French were reluctant. The British relatively quickly
                    understood that the United States was going to be a strong backer of unity, and
                    they also analyzed realistically where events were taking the situation. Within
                    a couple of months after the Wall came down, they were playing a very
                    constructive role. As often happens, the French had their particular concerns.
                    I'm sure that imbedded historical memories of the wars they had fought with
                    Germany were lurking in the background. With unification, France would lose its
                    position as the largest country in Europe. A united Germany would have over 80
                    million people compared to France's 56 million. Therefore, the French dragged
                    their feet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all working with the various delegations? What
                        werpeople doing when it wasn't just the foreign ministers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were constant talks between members of the two-plus-four teams.
                    Zoellick, Seitz, Blackwill, Rice, and Zelikow often visited Bonn and Berlin. We
                    spent a lot of time supporting their efforts. Personally, I spent quite a bit of
                    time touching base with the principal German negotiators in Bonn and reporting
                    these conversations to our two-plus-four team. We were called upon to make many
                    demarches in connection with the negotiations. The political and economic
                    reporting workload increased considerably. In that period, I saw Horst
                    Teltschik, who had not always been accessible previously, quite often. We kept
                    me abreast of the Germans' conversations with Soviet leaders. It was a very
                    active time.</p>

                        movemenof people and the opening of borders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: People started to vote with their feet on November 9th and continued
                    thereafter. West Germans also began to move into East Germany. I would travel
                    into East Germany whenever possible, so I had a snapshot every few weeks of the
                    way the situation was changing. The first indications of capitalism seemed to be
                    the import of western cigarettes, alcohol, used cars (mostly “lemons”), and
                    bananas, things the East Germans had been denied and things they didn't know
                    enough about. They didn't have real automobiles. The automobiles they had were
                    the miserable Trabants that had two-stroke engines. They didn't know how to
                    judge a used car, so every lemon in Europe headed to East Germany and was
                    promptly sold. The East Germans had some money because they were permitted to
                    exchange a limited number of East Marks for West Marks on a one-to-one basis.
                    You'd see little signs stuck in the dirt by the road for cigarettes or used
                    cars. Then you began to see computer software signs. It was interesting to see
                    capitalism beginning to grow. Then Home Depot-type stores started to
                    proliferate. There were huge traffic jams around the latter as the East Germans
                    began to buy materials to fix up their houses. The gray streets of Dresden,
                    Leipzig, and East Berlin began to bloom with color. Unfortunately, quite a few
                    home improvement companies from West Germany that weren't very scrupulous sold
                    new kitchens and new heating systems and new bathrooms to East Germans for
                    vastly more than they were worth. You began to hear stories of sophisticated,
                    sharp, and dishonest West Germans taking advantage of hardworking, simple East
                    Germans. This theme carried through to the present.</p>
                <p>In March 1990, there were the first free elections in East Germany; the first and
                    last. Our embassy in East Berlin followed the electoral campaign very closely,
                    as did we. The states that made up East Germany were known even back in the day
                    of the Weimar Republic as socialist leaning, especially Saxony. So, the embassy
                    in East Berlin reported that the Social Democrats and Socialists were going to
                    do really well, and you would probably have a government in East Germany that
                    would be unlike the government in West Germany. It would be a government of the
                    non-communist left. Most of us in the embassy in Bonn agreed with that election
                    analysis. We had an election pool within the embassy betting on what the
                    percentages of the various parties would be. Walters at the beginning said,
                    “It's not going to happen that way. Any party that has 'social' or 'socialist'
                    in its name is going to get creamed in this election. People don't want that.
                    They've had it for 50 years.” Unfortunately for Walters, we persuaded him that
                    he was wrong, and he changed his wager very late in the campaign. Had he not, he
                    would have won the pool hands down. Every party that had “social” or “socialist”
                    in its name did very poorly. A Christian Democratic-dominated government emerged
                    in East Berlin. That made doing business between East and West Germany much
                    easier and was another nail in the coffin of East Germany. If they were voting
                    for Christian Democrats in East Germany, then why do you need a separate
                    government there?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Q: It also would have allayed the fears of the CDU-dominated Bundestag of “Hell,
                    we don't want all these socialists coming in.” These were their brethren coming
                    in, although I assume they really weren't the same, were they?</p>
                <p>WARD: They were an odd collection of people. The communist government, the SED-
                    dominated government in East Germany, basically maintained puppet opposition
                    parties, one of which was named the CDU. So some of the people who went into the
                    CDU in East Germany were the old CDUers; they were puppet CDUers. Then there
                    were a lot of new people. It was an odd collection of people. Walters was a man
                    of great wisdom, and his point was on target. The East Germans weren't voting
                    for people. They were voting against the communists. The first elected prime
                    minister of East Germany, Demaziere, tended to look lost and out of place in
                    photographs. He was a modest man, a well-meaning man, and not an ex-stooge for
                    the communists. But he had very little impact in the two-plus-four negotiations.
                    It was clear from the outset that he wasn't going to represent an East Germany
                    that had any object other than unification. When unification happened in
                    October, the members of the East German parliament that were elected in March
                    became members of the Bundestag in Bonn. There was not a new election for the
                    Bundestag right away. The Easterners moved into the Bundestag as members on the
                    basis of their election in March</p>
                <p>Q: Was everybody looking at Czechoslovakia and Poland, figuring out what this was
                    going to mean? Also, you had Soviet troops on the ground there.</p>
                <p>WARD: That was a very important part of the diplomacy. One point that our team
                    made clear to Kohl, although I think Kohl already knew this, was that Germany
                    could not be united unless its relationships with Poland were placed on a better
                    footing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>WARD: There was great historical enmity, Germany having invaded Poland. There
                    needed to be a German-Polish agreement on the border. You had millions of West
                    Germans who were refugees from the former German lands in Russia and in Poland.
                    Every year, they'd get together in big rallies and talk about going home. So,
                    one of the very tough domestic issues that the Kohl government had to confront
                    was how to keep these tendencies within bounds. Although it was evident to any
                    dispassionate observer that Germany could not be unified within the borders of
                    1939, the irredentist leaders who had supported the CDU and CSU over the years
                    wanted more. So, Kohl had to do a very adroit dance. Genscher also played an
                    important role. They succeeded in negotiating an agreement with Poland that
                    recognized Poland within its borders, recognized the Oder-Neisse line as the
                    border between Germany and Poland. That was one of the keys that unlocked the
                    way to unification. The entire saga was the most interesting diplomatic
                    situation I was ever involved in. There were so many boxes to be checked,
                    agreements to be reached. In essence, we were completing the peace process for
                    World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the Soviet troops there? Did we
                        feel thSoviet army was with Gorbachev?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There was intense concern at the beginning that some Soviet commander might
                    do something rash out of a sense of humiliation. This was pretty quickly
                    dispelled when Gorbachev made clear that he was committed to a peaceful
                    resolution of the situation. I remember that once it became possible for us to
                    travel freely in East Germany, the Russian army that had seemed like such a
                    giant suddenly seemed pitiful. You would see young soldiers clothed in the
                    middle of the summer with their heavy woolen uniforms standing around
                    shiftlessly. They didn't know what to do. They didn't have a mission anymore. I
                    remember visiting Leipzig. There was still a Soviet garrison in the town. I
                    talked with the commander of the German forces. He said the Russians had
                    basically walled themselves off. There was no longer any communication with the
                    outside. They weren't threatening, but they weren't communicating either. One of
                    the prices that Germany paid for unification was tens if not hundreds of
                    millions of dollars spent in building housing for the Soviet forces that had to
                    return to Russia. The Germans basically paid for unification.</p>
                <p>Q: You've got East German sensitivities and Soviet sensitivities, as well as
                    Polish and Czech. I can see where we wanted to keep particularly American
                    politicians and also commentators and so on from going in and crowing and
                    talking about how great we were and “Look what we've done for you poor benighted
                    people.” This wouldn't have been helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>WARD: It wouldn't have been, but I can't recall anyone trying to do that. I
                    recall just the opposite. There is one evening that I remember that occurred at
                    my residence when we had as dinner guests a visiting delegation of U.S.
                    congressmen and former members of Congress. It was just after unification, when
                    the former members of the East German legislature had just joined the Bundestag.
                    We included a number of former East German legislators in the dinner. It was
                    fascinating. The East Germans were clearly watching the relationship between the
                    Americans and the West Germans. One later told me that they thought that it
                    would be like the relationship between the East Germans and the Russians, in
                    which there was a “friendship,” an institutional relationship, but not real
                    closeness. They saw just the opposite. My wife was instrumental in this. One of
                    the congressmen told her that he liked to sing. Then she found out that the wife
                    of another former member of Congress was a talented pianist. So, she askedthe
                    congressman to sing. He said, “Only if someone plays the piano.” The wife
                    volunteered to play the piano. What ensued was sort of an impromptu musical
                    evening with Americans singing some of our songs and teaching the Germans. Then
                    the Germans all got together, East and West. They all knew the same words to the
                    same songs. They could also sing, something I cannot say for the Americans. It
                    was striking. The Germans had been apart for 45 years, but had not forgotten
                    their shared music. Afterwards, one of the East Germans said to me that the
                    informal interaction between Americans and West Germans had been a revelation
                    that helped him realize that there really was a friendship between the United
                    States and the Federal Republic, one that had been built up over decades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anyone on the American side who was not with
                        thprogram?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There certainly were differences of opinion between our embassy and the
                    embassy in East Berlin and differences of approach. I think they were in error
                    in asserting that there was much in East Germany worthy of emulation in the
                    West. They probably think that our analysis was flawed. But I can't recall
                    anybody who actively sought to obstruct the process. This was a story without
                    any real villains. There were difficult personalities. I think it was to the
                    credit of President Bush, who gave the right direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was talk, people saying, “Oh, you've got to get out
                        to WesBerlin and dance on the Wall.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WARD: You need to talk to Harry Gilmore about this. Harry was concerned about the
                    possibility of such displays. He was concerned about excess jubilation. He did
                    take steps to curb that among official Americans and troops. Dick Barkley had
                    another concern that started before the fall of the Wall. Because East German
                    goods could be bought cheaply with hard currencies, there were great bargains to
                    be found in East Berlin. The U.S. Army had been running for years shopping
                    expeditions into East Berlin. On the basis of our four-power rights, soldiers
                    and dependents would come in busloads and buy out all the shops. Dick, I think
                    rightly, viewed that as not conducive to good relationships and worked to
                    curtail the shopping tours. The Army did not stop them, but they may have
                    reduced the frequency at some point.</p>
                <p>Q: You were mentioning that Dick Barkley and his embassy in East Germany were not
                    always on the same wavelength. What was your experience?</p>
                <p>WARD: I think it was very much a case of where you sit determining where you
                    stand. Dick had trouble shifting gears once the unification train began to move.
                    Prior to the fall of the Wall, he was very actively seeking to open up a new
                    relationship between East Germany and the United States that would promote
                    democratization. His embassy did a superb job of covering the East German
                    opposition. His team included J.D. Bindenagel as DCM and Jon Greenwald as
                    political counselor. They got permission to open a consulate in Leipzig, the
                    center of protest. Once the Wall came down, it was evident to us in Bonn that
                    events were outpacing our policy of promoting gradual change in the East. I can
                    remember a principal officers conference in Garmisch to which we had invited a
                    representative of the embassy in East Berlin. During the discussions, that
                    representative asserted that it was important not to lose the positive social
                    advances that the East Germans had made. Walters, who rarely showed his emotions
                    in his facial expressions, sort of sat back and said in a matter of fact manner,
                    “Could you tell me what those were?” Our friend from East Berlin appeared never
                    to have considered that question before and said, “Well, they have a wonderful
                    system of kindergartens.” Everybody sort of looked around. That's one vignette
                    that illustrates the contrast between the two missions.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The difference of approach between the embassies in Bonn and East Berlin was
                    evident in an incident that occurred at a higher leveyou'll find it in both
                    Walters's book in German and in the book by Zelikow and Rice on the subjecwhen
                    Secretary Baker came to Berlin after the opening of the Wall and before the
                    March 1990 free election in East Germany. A communist figurehead named Modrow
                    was still prime minister in East Germany. The question of whether Baker should
                    pay a call on Modrow arose. Walters said basically, “Modrow has been a communist
                    apparatchik all his life; he is there temporarily. He will be swept away. No one
                    will remember who he was. He doesn't matter. Visiting him would give him a
                    stature that he doesn't deserve. We're going to have free elections. You
                    shouldn't be visiting the communist leader.” Dick Barkley represented the
                    opposite view that East Germany was a fragile flower moving in a democratic
                    direction. Modrow was the leader; you needed to show that you recognize him; you
                    needed to go to visit him. Baker gave Walters the impression that he wouldn't
                    visit Modrow and sent both ambassadors away. Later, Dick Barkley somehow got to
                    see Baker again and persuaded the Secretary to see Modrow. When Baker and
                    Barkley made that decision behind Walters's back, Walters almost resigned on the
                    spot. He felt that Baker had not respected his views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself trying to calm things down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, that happened repeatedly, and I was ultimately unsuccessful. Walters
                    first told me we was going to resign in August 1989, when he felt rebuked by
                    Baker after the radio interview in which Walters said that he could foresee a
                    Germany united within five yearnot three months, but five years. The press
                    spokesman at the State Department made a statement to the effect that Ambassador
                    Walters's words did necessarily represent the policy of the United States. In
                    several instances, he felt rebuked by Baker, not supported by Baker, and cut off
                    from accurate information about deliberations in Washington and in the
                    two-plus-four talks. I can remember one awkward moment in the Ambassador's
                    residence in Bonn when Bob Zoellick basically refused to brief Walters on the
                    status of the two-plus-four talks. On a couple of occasions, Walters got notes
                    from the President in which Bush expressed support.</p>
                <p>Q: Baker had the reputation of having a small coterie around hiZoellick, Margaret
                    Tutwiler, and others who were around him and in a way were more protective of
                    Baker than of American policy. It made for a rather frosty relationship with
                    others. Of course, Walters was such a powerful figure in himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WARD: Walters and Baker were opposite personality types. Baker was extremely
                    controlled, the ultimate lawyer, very careful with words, a person of not many
                    words. And here is Walters, this gregarious, huge man of great wisdom and many,
                    many words and stories and languages. Baker was a linear thinker who did
                    business on a micro level. He looked at all the factors in the equation. Walters
                    was a non-linear thinker who looked at the big picture. Of course, he read the
                    current news, but what kept him up at night was reading history. For example, he
                    sought to learn about Russia by reading accounts like that of the Marquis de
                    Custine, who traveled through Russia in the early nineteenth century. He was
                    passionate about history, about what the events of 200-300 years ago could tell
                    us about contemporary problems. That was a very different approach from the
                    Baker team approach. You needed both, but unfortunately they didn't get along.
                    In the spring of 1991, after the Gulf War, Walters told the President that he
                    would like to leave his post as soon as a successor could be named. He left in
                    July.</p>
                <p>You asked about relations between East and West Germany in terms of the U.S.
                    diplomatic missions. There was one other aspect to this. You had the problem of
                    staffing in Berlin. We had in Berlin a very large mission and a growing embassy.
                    It was clear when we decided to open a unified office in Berlin that would be
                    subordinate to the embassy in Bonn that we would need to cut staff. The view
                    from the West was that most of the German employees in the East were reporting
                    to the East German secret police. Many of them may have been secret police
                    agents. Therefore, they should not be retained. The embassy in East Berlin had a
                    different view. To resolve the problem of both American and German staffing, I
                    met with the DCM from East Berlin and our Minister in West Berlin. We basically
                    went position by position and defined our personnel needs for the new office in
                    Berlin. Dick Barkley was not happy with the result. He, in fact, basically
                    advocated retaining two ambassadors and two missions even in a unified Germany.
                    That idea seemed to me then just as bizarre as it does today. Unfortunately,
                    some people in the State Department thought it deserved consideration. I had a
                    phone call from Jim Dobbins, who was the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in
                    the European Bureau, who asked why the idea was so bad. After all, maybe there
                    could be an ambassador in Berlin who was in charge of unification problems and
                    another one in Bonn who would be the ambassador in Germany. I said that I didn't
                    think that you needed two ambassadors, and that I thought Ambassador Walters
                    would take the same position. The idea went away.</p>
                <p>Q: We were adjusting.</p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Sometimes minds lag behind events. This was a case when history was
                    moving faster than people's minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Kohl? Was he the man of the

                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WARD: Definitely. Kohl understood where this was heading. He was willing to make
                    the political and financial investments to make it happen, and he realized that
                    it had to happen quickly before something else intervened. In fact, had he
                    waited, we would have had the Gulf War and then the breakup of Yugoslavia as
                    additional problems.</p>

                    along very well. Walters had access to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Walters and Genscher get along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: They got along okay. They probably didn't relate as welinstinctively to
                    each other as Walters did with Kohl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our economic people saying as Kohl agreed to
                        exchangmarks on a one to one basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Our economists in both East and West were telling us how disastrous this
                    was. In an economic sense, it was pretty expensive if not downright disastrous.
                    But Kohl believed that it had to be done for political reasons. Sometimes you do
                    things that are not economically wise out of political necessity, and then you
                    pay a price. Germany has paid a price economically for this. Kohl and the CDU
                    were eventually overcome, in part because of the economic cost of
                    unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Until July 1992.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you almost have to rein in our intelligence people, the station chief and
                    so on? All of a sudden, you're going to have East Germany opening up. It was a
                    treasure trove, but did you try to keep people from being overly greedy?</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>WARD: To say that we had to rein them in would imply that they were formerly
                    under our control. Fortunately, however, our intelligence services played a
                    constructive role. Given Walters' background, he had a very good relationship
                    with the station chief, and so did I. I had confidence in the other
                    representatives of intelligence and law enforcement who made up the country
                    team. The station played a significant role, most of which is still classified.
                    But there is one aspect that has been in the press and is worth noting. That is
                    the fact that copies of the records of the East German secret police, the Stasi,
                    were acquired by the CIA. These records quickly became very important from both
                    an intelligence and a law enforcement point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like the Berlin Document Center, which housed the Nazi
                        files.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Exactly. We seem at the end of wars, hot or cold, to be lucky in terms of
                    records. The records of the Berlin Document Center are fascinating in
                    themselves, but the Stasi records were even more important during the
                    unification saga. One of the things that we soon discovered was that we had
                    spies among our non-American employees in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you kind of know it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We of course assumed that the Stasi had penetrated our staff, but did not
                    have suspects. It turned out that a German woman employed by one of the Defense
                    Department offices in the embassy had been an agent for 15-20 years, and was
                    responsible for taking thousands of classified documents. Unfortunately, she had
                    an American security clearance. There were a couple of other cases. There was a
                    controversy between the FBI and the CIA over the records. The FBI wanted to gain
                    access to the files for criminal investigative purposes, while the CIA wanted to
                    keep them closely held for intelligence purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In turning people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Right. The ambassador and I sought to mediate these disputefrom time to
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germany was unified on your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes, in October 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out? Were we watching to make sure that
                        wdidn't take too much center stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WARD: That wasn't a problem. The Germans understood from the very start that the
                    United States supported unification. By the time October came along, the hard
                    work of the two-plus-four had been done. All the necessary agreements that
                    replaced the post-World War II four-power agreements within Germany were in
                    place. In some cases such as on troop stationing, these were temporary
                    arrangements that had to be turned into treaties later. But I don't recall
                    anyone needing to be reined in or crowing about our role. It was a German show.
                    It was orchestrated as a German show.</p>
                <p>Q: We had had a very significant presence in West Germany since 1945,
                    particularly the Amerika Hauser. I would think that we would want to do somewhat
                    the equivalent in East Germany to bring them up to the same knowledge of the
                    United States and its role with the rest of Germany.</p>
                <p>WARD: Remember that East Germany had a smaller population than the largest West
                    German state - 17 million people in a pretty small area. Dick Barkley had put in
                    place a program to open a consulate in Leipzig and also a cultural center. Of
                    course, once unification happened, the large cultural facilities of the mission
                    in Berlin became available to everybody. One touching incident occurred - I
                    remember it from a cable Harry Gilmore sent. When the Wall opened, an East
                    Berlin woman went back and returned library books to the American library in
                    West Berlin that she had taken out before the Wall went up and had been unable
                    to return. There were things like that. People remembered.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1990, before unification, and before the decision was made to
                    move the capital to Berlin, we in Bonn understood where things were headed. Dick
                    Imus, the minister for economic affairs, Harry Geisel, the minister-counselor
                    for administration, and I got together and wrote a report called “Mission 2000.”
                    The report was a guide to restructuring the mission after unification. We
                    posited, first of all, that the capital would move to Berlin, and that the
                    embassy would have to follow. Then we recommended restructuring the mission,
                    downsizing it severely, keeping the consulate in Leipzig open, closing some of
                    the facilities in West Germany but keeping a large cultural presence in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Q: This is not quite a propos but is something I've talked to a few people about.
                    Did you notice there was a problem with Germany in the United States in that
                    when Americans go to visit Europe, they go to England, France, Italy, and Spain,
                    but Germany has a reputation as being a bit cold and expensive? Were we
                    monitoring American tourism to Germany?</p>
                <p>WARD: We didn't count tourists. We never felt alone there. We had a couple of
                    hundred thousand soldiers and dependents there. So, Germany always felt like a
                    place with a lot of Americans. I always had the impression that because so many
                    Americans had served in Germany in the forces, that created a flow of tourists,
                    both relatives visiting people in the forces and also people who had been in the
                    forces coming back to visit. I never thought Germany was as expensive as
                    France.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Q: Right afterwards, after the unification of Germany, was there a letdown about
                    what to do next? You have this army sitting there. We knew where everything was,
                    what we were after, and who the enemy was. It's all over now.</p>
                <p>WARD: That started, but was quickly interrupted. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in
                    August 1990, even before Germany was unified. Then you had the Balkans begin to
                    come apart. But there was a period in which we had a Foreign Service inspection
                    and the inspectors were emphasizing to us that we really needed to transition to
                    an embassy based on our economic relationship, that politics didn't matter
                    anymore. Nothing could have been further from the truth in terms of what has
                    mattered since. The German-American relationship was very important for shaping
                    the NATO approach to the Balkans, and political relationships were the key to
                    assembling the Gulf War coalition. It was a war for which we received so much
                    financial assistance that we eventually had to prove to the Germans that we
                    didn't make a profit. Frankly, I think that the Defense Department rolled into
                    the cost of the Gulf War a lot of marginally related improvements to our bases
                    in Germany. We certainly repaved a few runways on American airbases in Germany
                    with German money during that time.</p>
                <p>Q: What about when the Gulf War came? You were there when Saddam Hussein made his
                    move. How did we react right away? Did you work to get up support? Did the
                    Germans jump right on board as far as condemning this?</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WARD: Official Germany jumped right on board right away. Of course, the left
                    didn't. As soon as we began to move forces into the Gulf area, we started to get
                    protests. There was a peace camp set up next to the embassy, a fairly large
                    group of people who sat outside our gates and demonstrated every day. Then the
                    Red Army faction, the RAF, launched an attack against the embassy with automatic
                    weapons. The embassy sits along the Rhine. They pulled up a car on the other
                    side of the Rhine, and like good Germans put out warning triangles to stop
                    traffic. They took a couple of sandbags that they had brought with them and put
                    them on a wall, and then used them as supports for two automatic rifles, with
                    which they fired about 270 rounds at the embassy at about 7:00 pm. Luckily,
                    there were only 75 people in the building. At about 6:45, the ambassador had
                    gone home. At about 6:50, I had followed him out the door. I got home at about
                    7:00. My wife was on the phone with a good friend, the wife of my Canadian
                    colleague, who lived near the embassy, who was saying, “Peggy, your embassy is
                    being attacked.” Peggy looked at me coming in the door and said, “Oh, no, that
                    can't be true because George is here.” I said, “Thanks for the faith in me, but
                    maybe I'd better call the embassy.” I called Post 1, the Marine guard. Because I
                    didn't want to appear alarmist, I asked only if anything unusual was happening.
                    The guard said something like, “Yes, Sir, we're getting shot at.” It was very
                    interesting. The incident started and ended within about two minutes. From both
                    U.S. sources and German police sources, we had reports, later proven false, of
                    people in the woods shooting at us for hours afterwards, so people were down on
                    the floor in the embassy for hours. The attack caused a siege mentality among
                    the American community in Bonn. People felt really threatened. We did everything
                    we could to beef up security, especially at the school. People were fearful for
                    their kids' lives. Of course, once you put police with weapons in the open at a
                    school, the fear gets even higher. We had a lot of town meetings, a lot of
                    sessions with people to try to allay concerns. Even so, we had some people who
                    really did some fairly irrational thinghoarding groceries, sending their
                    families home.</p>
                <p>Q: On the Gulf War, what was the task of the embassy?</p>
                <p>WARD: The task of the embassy was to: a) work with the Germans to ensure that we
                    could flow forces out of Germany to the Gulf without difficulty, and b) to gain
                    German financial and material support for the war. For example, Germany placed
                    its railways and barge services at our disposal, gave us the highest priority.
                    They allowed us to load our tanks and armored personnel carriers [APCs] on
                    barges, on trains, with ammunition and fuel uploaded, which is normally not
                    done. It was unusual, but needed to happen because these were vehicles going
                    directly to war. They needed to be ready when they rolled off the ship. So, you
                    saw a constant flow of barges loaded with U.S. military equipment going along
                    the Rhine toward the North Sea and the ports. That was a big job.</p>
                <p>The Germans made a large financial contribution to the war. They did not
                    contribute combat forces, but they did provide chemical and biological weapons
                    detection units. They had an excellent vehicle, called the Fuchs (Fox), which
                    was designed for that purpose. We arranged to get some of those quickly into our
                    inventory.</p>

                <p>WARD: He was during the Gulf episode very supportive. I can't recall any special
                    difficulties. The Germans did virtually everything we asked. They made
                    exceptions that they never would have contemplated in a normal situation for our
                    forces; they did everything they could.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: This is very important. As a Yugoslav hand, I've interviewed Warren Zimmermann
                    and spent a lot of time in Yugoslavia. Genscher does not come across as the
                    number one hero.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WARD: And neither do the Germans, but neither were we. It was an episode worth
                    thinking about. As Yugoslavia started to fall apart, we in the embassy got very
                    little either in terms of information or instructions to present demarches. I
                    assumed that this was because someone else was staying in touch with the Germans
                    at a high level. In the major European embassies, you have “cabinet lines,”
                    direct hookups between the NSC and the National Security Advisors on the
                    European side, and between the heads of government and the President. So, I
                    figured, if we're not discussing these important matters where we clearly have
                    differences of view with the Germans, then this must be being done at a very
                    high level. That illusion was swept away one day in early December 1991, when
                    with the EU, led by the Germans, was on the verge of recognizing Croatia and
                    Slovenia. Kohl's coalition partner, the Bavarian CSU, was pushing particularly
                    hard for this. We received an instruction from the Department to go and tell the
                    Germans in no uncertain terms not to go forward with recognition, to stop doing
                    what they were doing. I was absolutely dismayed. I felt, here we were, not
                    having had the kind of discussions you need to prepare the ground, and we were
                    being asked to present an ultimatum. I delivered that demarche to Jurgen
                    Chrobog, who was political director then and later ambassador to Washington.
                    Chrobog, who became a good friend, later told me, “George, I almost gave you
                    that paper back and told you to leave my office.” He was so angry, and I think
                    justly so, because he felt that, here are these Americans, who have not involved
                    us in a dialogue about the future of Yugoslavia in the way they should have,
                    coming in to tell me the day before an important EU meeting is going to happen
                    not to execute the policy that we have carefully planned. The next day, the
                    Germans did exactly what they had planned. They led the EU in the decision to
                    recognize Croatia and Slovenia. We followed suit by recognizing Bosnia.</p>

                        this wahis thing, but this thing came out of the CSU and not the FDP.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Croatia, being a Catholic country, had a lot of influence in the CSU.
                    I know that the CSU pushed hard. Genscher may also have for other reasons.</p>

                    a Genscher thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: The subject had come up, but at the level of first secretary, maybe
                    political counselor. We never had received instructions sufficient to discuss
                    policy in any depth. I think Washington was distracted and hoped the problem
                    would go away. You had the unification of Germany that was still being
                    completed. You had the Soviet Union beginning to fall apart. And you had a
                    war.</p>

                <p>WARD: Then you had Jacques Poos, the Luxembourg prime minister and President of
                    the European Union. He said something like, “Now is the hour of Europe, not the
                    hour of the United States.” Baker must have thought, “Wonderful. I don't want
                    this to be the hour of the United States either. Let's forget about it.”</p>
                <p>Q: I can remember talking to Larry Eagleburger, another Yugoslav hand. We were

                <p>WARD: The lesson still to this day is that nothing gets done on the security side

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: My primary job was to be the alter ego of the Assistant Secretary and to
                    manage the bureau. I also was in charge of United Nations political affairs and
                    peacekeeping.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a little outside your purview. How would you put the attitude within
                    the State Department and within the White House toward international
                    organizations, particularly peacekeeping?</p>
                <p>WARD: Actually, it was a time at least initially when the administration saw the
                    United Nations and to some extent peacekeeping in a very positive context
                    because we were still coming out of the Gulf War, in which the United Nations
                    had provided very valuable support and legal backing for Desert Storm. The
                    administration had been very active in building a coalition within the United
                    Nations. The Perm Five, the five permanent members of the Security Council, were
                    acting more or less in concert on most issues. Some of the peacekeeping
                    operations, notably ones in Namibia, had been successful in 1990-1991, and the
                    operation in Cambodia seemed to be going relatively well. Somalia had not yet
                    begun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was John Bolton's background and how did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: He is by training an attorney. He was an Assistant Attorney General before
                    he came to the State Department. John was close to the Secretary and was part of
                    the core team that managed the UN during the Gulf War and was very instrumental
                    in the outcomes that we got from UN resolutions. At the end of the Gulf War, he
                    was also one of the principal architects of the United Nations Security Council
                    Resolutions 687 and 688 among others, which ended the war. Resolution 688 later
                    became very controversial because different parties interpreted it very
                    differently on the extent to which the United States and others could intervene
                    within Iraq. But John was in many ways skeptical of further, deeper engagement
                    in peacekeeping and certainly skeptical about enlarging the mandate of the
                    United Nations, especially those non-Security Council parts of the UN where we
                    could not play as decisive a role.</p>
                <p>Q: Secretary of State James Baker had the reputation of having a rather tight
                    knit core group around him on the seventh floor. How did Bolton fit? Did he have
                    clout within that group?</p>
                <p>WARD: I thought John Bolton had considerable clout with James Baker and with his
                    core group up to a certain point. I didn't see anything to disabuse the popular
                    notion that Secretary Baker did operate from within a pretty closed circle of
                    trusted advisors, but I think Bolton had a good deal of credibility with those
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with IO from '92 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: '96. Q: You really saw all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Of course, Secretary Baker resigned during the campaign. Eagleburger
                    first became Acting Secretary and then later Secretary. There was a real
                    watershed on U.S. attitudes towards peacekeeping that's often forgotten.
                    President Bush asked his team to look at the subject of peacekeeping, and they
                    published an NSDD on the subject, maybe Number 13. Following on from that
                    policy, President Bush gave a speech to the UN General Assembly in September
                    1992 in which he outlined a fairly ambitious approach to peacekeeping, making
                    clear that the United States was willing under certain circumstances to
                    contribute troops to peacekeeping operations, something that had not in the past
                    been the case. He also tightly limited the circumstances in which we would
                    participate. But the same address also contained proposals for increasing the
                    efficiency of the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations. It was a step
                    forward in peacekeeping that was later picked up by the Clinton administration.
                    Later, after that speech, the emergency in Somalia became front-page news.
                    Actually, the worst of the famine was over by the time CNN focused on the
                    situation. There had been a small United Nations peacekeeping operation of about
                    500 Pakistani soldiers in Somalia prior to the major intervention around
                    November 1992, but those soldiers were basically stuck at the Mogadishu airport
                    and couldn't be effective in their role, which was to protect the food convoys.
                    The food convoys weren't getting through. The warlords were looting them. This
                    became a major story on television. Pictures of starving children and suffering
                    motivated the U.S. and others to do something. So, we in November 1992 formed a
                    coalition and sponsored a Security Council resolution that authorized the
                    coalition to intervene under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, that is,
                    with the right to use force. That coalition force landed in Somalia during the
                    Bush administration.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your feeling and the feeling of the people around you as this
                    developed? Was it that this was a diversion or the wrong place to do it?</p>
                <p>WARD: John Bolton seemed to me very skeptical of the idea of intervening. He was
                    in a minority at the level of Assistant Secretary and on the seventh floor of
                    the State Department at the time. He was skeptical that we would be able to get
                    in, do the job, and get out cleanly. Some would say that subsequent history has
                    proven him correct in that respect. He also was skeptical of the concept of
                    intervening on solely humanitarian grounds, of using massive force for
                    humanitarian purposes.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WARD: I represented the Bureau in most of the meetings in the run-up to the
                    Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force and in planning
                    coalition strategy</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there people, say, from the African Bureau who were
                        familiawith Somalia saying, “This isn't going to be that easy?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There may have been, but I don't recall any people within the African
                    Bureau opposing the intervention. I do recall a cable from our Ambassador in
                    Nairobi, Smith Hempstone that predicted Somalia would become a tar baby for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the phrase came, “If you liked Beirut, you'll

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. John Bolton was not very active in expressing his doubts. He
                    understood that the President and the Secretary really wished to intervene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Department of Defense representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I recall that once it became clear that the intervention would initially be
                    by a force commanded by the United States, much of their initial hesitancy
                    melted away. We did go in with pretty overwhelming force and actually
                    established an admirable degree of order throughout much of the country,
                    including down to the provincial level. That was a level of security that was
                    not replicated later when the coalition force was replaced by a United Nations
                    peacekeeping force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it at the time, how did this develop? The
                        phrase camin, particularly during this operation of “Mission Creep.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Mission creep and nation building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what those both mean and also how you
                        sathat and your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I believe that the charge of mission creep is justified in the case of
                    Somalia. We went there with a mission to deliver humanitarian supplies. That
                    later, during the Clinton Administration, turned into a mission to effect a
                    change in the political dynamics by hunting down the leader of one of the
                    principal clans there, Mohammed Aideed. It seems to me that there was an
                    incrementalism that could be thought of as mission creep, one mission sliding
                    into another.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Now, the question of nation building is more or less a canard. In any
                    peacekeeping situation, what you are doing is trying to build a capable state.
                    If you're going to call that nation building, so be it. But, in fact,
                    peacekeeping is about putting things back together, taking states that are
                    failed or divided or in conflict and helping end the conflict and then putting a
                    society back on its feet. Unfortunately because of Somalia, nation building has
                    become a very negative term. Even today, I find that when people want to say it
                    in meetings, they'll call it by another word or apologize for using the term.
                    But in fact we are doing nation building in Kosovo and in Bosnia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what you do. You've got to have something to put
                        itogether again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I later became ambassador in a nation that was built in largpart by the
                    United Nations and a peace operation.</p>
                <p>Somalia ran off the tracks early in the Clinton Administration, when the
                    operation came under UN control. In June 1993, Pakistani soldiers attempted to
                    seize a radio station that was being used by Aideed as a propaganda mechanism.
                    They took some fairly serious casualties. That led to a couple of things. First,
                    we reinforced the UN presence in Somalia. This included the insertion of both
                    Ranger forces and the so-called Delta force. It also started a debate over
                    whether there should be heavy armor in the UN force. It led to a de facto war
                    against Aideed, which became the driving spirit of the UN operation. All of this
                    was playing out in the context of a Clinton administration review of
                    peacekeeping policy that started out as a PRD [Presidential Review Directive]
                    and then turned eventually in 1994 into Presidential Decision Directive 25 on
                    Multilateral Peacekeeping. I was involved in the process of writing that policy.
                    Our experience in peacekeeping operations and especially the Somalia operation
                    played very heavily in the shaping the PDD. At the beginning of the Clinton
                    administration, Madeleine Albright, who at that time was ambassador to the
                    United Nations, supported the idea of “assertive multilateralism,” which
                    included a heavy commitment to peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations.
                    Her people were open to the idea of creating a United Nations Standing Force. At
                    least one staff person at the NSC advocated a debate on that issue in the
                    context of the PRD. Defense and the JCS rejected the idea. I also opposed
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Standing Force being the United Nations army.</hi>

                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>WARD: That's too strong, but it would have been a force at the disposal of the
                    United Nations, whether based centrally or on call. That particular idea did not
                    get very far anyway given the opposition in other parts of the State Department
                    and in the Defense Department. The Somalia operation began to get more
                    complicated and more violent. We started to take more casualties, and in October
                    1993 we lost 18 U.S. soldiers in a pitched battle on the streets of Mogadishu.
                    It was an ill-conceived operation that became a watershed for U.S. policy on
                    peacekeeping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point, there was a debate of sending armor in or
                        not. ThClinton administration seemed to be reluctant to get too far into
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We did not send our own armor in, but we did ask the United Nations to find
                    other armored forces. We ended up with Malaysian tanks and armored personnel
                    carriers, not as capable as the ones we would have brought. We had part of the
                    10th Mountain Division there. They were light infantry. On that day in October
                    1993, the plan was for the Rangers and Delta Force to be inserted by helicopter
                    and to capture certain people who were reported to be meeting in a house in
                    Mogadishu and then to be convoyed out by in trucks and Humvees. The plan went
                    awry when one of the helicopters was downed and the force split itself in order
                    to guard the site of the downed helicopter. They were then attacked. Crowds of
                    thousands gathered. It was hard to distinguish between the crowds and
                    combatants. There was very heavy fire. The force took heavy casualties. O90-100
                    U.S. soldiers, 18 were killed. There were even heavier casualties on the Somali
                    side. The operation lasted one day. An armored force finally extracted the
                    Rangers. Our losses really knocked the wind out of our peacekeeping sails. From
                    that moment forward, the strategy for Somalia as far as I could see was to get
                    out as fast as possible.</p>
                <p>Q: In Serbia, when Serbia was being very nasty under Milosevic and we were saying
                    we were going to do something, the Serbs would taunt us with the number 18.</p>
                <p>WARD: You're correct. As the drama in Bosnia was playing out, we seemed to be
                    intent upon finding ways not to intervene, not to use force there. Oddly enough,
                    the resolution that authorized the UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia actually
                    was a Chapter 7 resolution. For me, it was an interesting study in human
                    psychology that very often both U.S. officials and UN officials referred to the
                    mandate as a Chapter 6 mandate and literally refused to recognize that Chapter 7
                    authority was there for them to pick up if they wanted.</p>

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>WARD: Sorry for the jargon. Chapter Six is the part of the United Nations charter
                    that pertains to peaceful settlement of disputes. Historically, Chapter Six has
                    been the justification for peacekeeping operations, operations in which the only
                    force authorized is self-protection. Peacekeeping forces may not use force to
                    impose their will on the contending sides. Chapter Seven deals with threats to
                    international peace and security, and has been used as the authorizing authority
                    for peace enforcement operations such as, for example, the November 1993
                    operation in Somalia and Desert Storm.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: In some ways, it was that way. In other ways, it was just the opposite.
                    Every geographic bureau in the State Department wanted peacekeeping forces in
                    their own area. The number of peacekeeping operations was going up
                    exponentially. I don't have the compilation of figures here, but there were
                    something like 10-15 UN peacekeeping operations in total before the end of the
                    Cold War and many times more than that afterwards. At one point, there were
                    80,000 peacekeepers in operations worldwide. There were about 20 operations
                    going on simultaneously. The peacekeeping budget was on the order of two billion
                    dollars a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say this, it's hard to remember where these
                        were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Tajikistan, Georgia, the operations in Western Sahara, in various places in
                    Africa, in the Middle East, a changing array of operations. At one point, there
                    were two operations in Rwanda at the same time. The casualties in Somalia
                    created a chilling effect on the willingness of the Congress to appropriate the
                    funds necessary for peacekeeping. This was at a time also when people in
                    Congress wanted to reduce our level of assessments to the United Nations, and we
                    were starting to get way behind in paying our dues. The United Nations assessed
                    us at over 31% for peacekeeping. At first during my tenure, we were paying at a
                    level of about 28%. Later Congress forced us to go down to the level of 25%,
                    which was the level of our assessment for regular UN dues. There are two UN
                    budgets, one for regular expenses and the other for peacekeeping. We had a
                    larger assessment for peacekeeping than for the regular budget. The differential
                    between our assessment and what we were paying quickly added up to real money.
                    Our arrears to the UN began to grow truly large. That affected the ability of
                    the UN to carry out peacekeeping and also reimburse those nations that
                    contributed to peacekeeping.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Fiji, Bangladesh, and some African countries needed the money the UN paid
                    for the use of their soldiers. For those countries, the UN rate of reimbursement
                    of $988 per soldier per month was a lot more than their costs.</p>
                <p>During this period the Congress also passed some very restrictive legislation on
                    peacekeeping, requiring that before the U.S. voted on a peacekeeping resolution,
                    we had to send the text up to the Hill and give them 15 days notice. We had to
                    manage a difficult process in the United Nations where we weren't able to vote
                    on a resolution overnight; it had to go up to the Hill for consideration. The
                    administration was required to brief Congress once a month on every operation
                    that existed. I did the briefings. Offices in IO and at the Department of
                    Defense put a great deal of effort into assembling these monthly reports. We did
                    full-scale briefings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed
                    Services Committee, the House International Relations Committee, and the House
                    Appropriations Subcommittee for State and Commerce. That took a great deal of
                    time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: From our embassys' reporting and also from the United Nations. The UN
                    operations filed frequent reports. In many cases, we had observers in these
                    operations even if we didn't have troops. There was not a lack of information.
                    The problem was filtering all the information. We would put together a thick
                    briefing book and go up there and deliver it. It was made a matter of record.
                    They were rough briefings because peace operations did not have much support on
                    the Hill.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WARD: There was certainly increasing partisanship. I'm not sure I would call it
                    isolationism. There was intense partisanship, and certainly once the Republicans
                    took control of the House in '95, the attitude toward peacekeeping became yet
                    more difficult. The issues of peacekeeping and UN dues can't really be
                    separated. It was the peacekeeping issue that built the arrears and also built
                    the negative sentiment on Capitol Hill. So, we had working groups within the
                    State Department and interagency on this question. Wendy Sherman was Assistant
                    Secretary for Congressional Relations. Secretary Christopher was very involved
                    in this. We devised the concept of what came to be known, unfortunately, as the
                    “grand bargain.” It would have been a deal between the Congress and the
                    Executive on both paying our UN dues and imposing restrictions on peacekeeping.
                    The deal would have required the Executive Branch to impose some pretty tight
                    restrictions on peacekeeping and also to reduce the UN budget and keep it under
                    control. I was one of those who negotiated with some of Speaker Gingrich's
                    people on those questions. We actually got pretty far. The problem was that this
                    issue, although allegedly important to President Clinton, was never important
                    enough for him to engage Gingrich personally. We needed the element of
                    presidential leadership to seal the deal. That never happened. We did end up
                    applying stringent fiscal restraints on the United Nations. For years we had
                    insisted on a no real growth budget. We started to require a no-nominal-growth
                    budget, which in effect meant a reduced budget. We succeeded in that. In fact,
                    one year I had to play the bad guy and withheld instructions from our delegation
                    to agree to the UN budget until it was reduced. They had to stop the clock at
                    midnight on December 31, but we finally got the budget reductions.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>WARD: From the very start, she made clear that she wanted to play a full role as
                    a member of the Cabinet as well as Permanent Representative to the United
                    Nations. The Cabinet role of the United Nations ambassador has shifted over
                    time. In fact, in the latter stages of the Bush administration, Ed Perkins was
                    not a member of the Cabinet. He was the last UN ambassador under Bush. John
                    Bolton told me when I took the job in the IO Bureau that the U.S. mission to the
                    United Nations was an “instructed” mission, that is, a mission that acted on the
                    basis of clear direction from Washington. During the Bush administration, I
                    often played the role of the person who would give very detailed instructions to
                    our Permanent Representative and Deputy Permanent Representative on the content
                    of resolutions. They had very restricted freedom of negotiation. Madeleine
                    Albright, having been brought on as a member of the Cabinet with a more
                    expansive role as PermRep, did not fit that mold. Her mission to the United
                    Nations was an “instructed” mission in name only. It did receive telegrams of
                    instructions from the IO bureau, but more often than not those telegrams
                    followed exactly the line that Madeleine had worked out with the Secretary or
                    with Tony Lake or later Sandy Berger or sometimes with the President himself. I
                    maintained cordial relations with Madeleine Albright. She swore me in as
                    ambassador. I respected her energy and intelligence. But if she didn't like the
                    instructions that were coming out of the bureaucracy, she would get new ones.
                    So, that changed the role of the bureau very considerably. She strengthened the
                    Washington office of the United Nations ambassador. There had always been a
                    Washington office of USUN staffed by a couple of people, but her Washington
                    office grew in size and also in its participation in interagency meetings and in
                    meetings at the White House and National Security Council. Madeleine cut a broad
                    swath on the Washington scene and was very influential. She attended every
                    Cabinet meeting and every so-called Principals Committee meeting. That was also
                    a new thing for the United Nations ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any tension between Madeleine Albright and

                </p>
                <p>WARD: They had different styles. Madeleine was more of an activist, especially at
                    the beginning. She talked about assertive multilateralism, and I had the sense
                    that she believed in it. Shand I think she was on the right wavelengtpromoted
                    whenever she could more vigorous U.S. involvement in the Balkans. She saw
                    Milosevic very early on for what he was and wanted to bring him to justice.
                    Christopher was much more careful. He is a lawyer, he was very careful and
                    circumspect. But the two seemed to share good interpersonal relations. I'm sure
                    they had their differences, but they were never in the open.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you all dread CNN? One had the feeling, particularly in things like
                    peacekeeping, thinking about our intervention with the Kurds in Iraq and in

                    Europe, too, by the more starving children you can see, the more pressure there
                    is to get involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes. That was certainly true in the case of Somaliless true, however, in
                    the case of the Balkans and certainly of Rwanda in April 1994. Of course,
                    Rwanda, coming in the wake of Mogadishu, happened at precisely the wrong time.
                    It's a subject that deserves discussion. Here is a situation in which we knew
                    exactly what was happening and decided to take no effective military action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Let me start in January 1994. Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott took a
                    trip to Africa, including Rwanda. Doug Bennett, who was the Clinton
                    administration's first Assistant Secretary for International Organizations, a
                    wonderful man who is now the president of Wesleyan University, went on the trip
                    with Talbott. Doug came back and said to me, “This place is going to blow up.”
                    He had been in the Kigali market where you could buy an AK- 47 or a hand grenade
                    for almost nothing. Weapons were just all over the place. It was clear to him
                    that tensions were such that things were going to blow up. Later, probably in
                    the very last days of March or very early days of April, in a mysterious
                    incident that's never been fully clarified, the presidents of both Rwanda and
                    Burundi were killed in a plane crash near the Kigali airport. They were
                    returning together from an OAU meeting. The plane crash turned out to be the
                    trigger for a very well orchestrated plot by Hutu extremists to slaughter
                    Tutsis. That needs some explanation. The Hutus are about 85% of the population
                    of Rwanda. The Tutsis are about 15%. There was a civil war in which the Tutsis,
                    organized militarily in the Rwandan Patriotic Front, had fled Rwanda to Uganda
                    and then had reentered Rwanda to fight the Hutu-led government. The United
                    Nations had put in place two peacekeeping operations, one within Kigali to
                    separate the two sides that were talking to each other, and the other between
                    the forces in the field. In that context, with the United Nations already in
                    Rwanda, the plane crashes, the presidents are killed, the Hutu extremists begin
                    to take action using information broadcast by so-called hate radios, one of
                    which was called Radio Milles Collines [French: Thousand Hills], which broadcast
                    not only hate vitriol but also instructions on what to do. The plan was to kill
                    not only Tutsis, buy also Hutu moderates. It began very quickly with large-scale
                    slaughter in Kigali, and then spread through much of the country. The reporting
                    from the embassy in Kigali was superb, even heroic. It was a very violent
                    situation. Hundreds of thousands of people were being killed. We had real-time
                    information, not exact numbers, but it was very clear that genocidal-type
                    violence was going on. In the wake of the outcome in Somalia - and by the way,
                    by then we had pulled out of Somalia with our tail between our legs - there was
                    no effective voice raised with a plan for effective United States action in
                    Rwanda. Another factor in the equation was that Belgium was a non-permanent
                    member of the UN Security Council during this episode. Belgium was the
                    ex-colonial power in Rwanda and participated in the peacekeeping force that was
                    in Kigali. Several Belgian peacekeepers tried to give shelter to the prime
                    minister, who was a moderate. They were taken captive. The prime minister, a
                    woman, was killed. The Belgian peacekeepers were first tortured and then
                    killed.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The government in Belgium insisted frantically on a new Security Council
                    resolution that would authorize the withdrawal of the existing UN peacekeeping
                    forces in Rwanda. So, at a time when we might have been thinking about what to
                    do about the violence, the Belgian pressure was causing us to concentrate on
                    getting the force out. That was certainly the personal focus of Madeleine
                    Albright. The Belgians got their resolution, which officially left the United
                    Nations in a position of having no peacekeeping forces in Rwanda except those
                    who wished to stay. The Ghanaians agreed to stay. The Canadian general stayed.
                    But the Belgians left. No one within our government advocated an effective plan
                    for intervention. Under Secretary Tim Wirth, who Christopher had placed in
                    charge of the crisis, convened meeting after meeting searching for a way to
                    intervene. He got nowhere, in part because the Defense Department offered no
                    options. I don't know whether that might have changed had there been more
                    effective intervention at the presidential level or perhaps at the level of
                    Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and National Security Advisor. The
                    fact is that this crisis was handled mostly at the Under Secretary/Assistant
                    Secretary level. There was very little discussion of effective intervention. The
                    course of action that was decided upon, upon the urging of National Security
                    Council senior director Richard Clarke, was the so-called “adopt-a-battalion”
                    plan. This was an effort in which the U.S. and various European countries would
                    help train and equip African peacekeeping battalions for Rwanda. Our role was to
                    provide the Ghanaians with M-113 armored personnel carriers. Even though the
                    order to procure the M-113s was supposed to be an emergency one, it took months
                    to get the APCs to Africa. By the time the Ghanaians got them, the genocide was
                    over. A lot of people have apologized, including President Clinton, for what
                    happened in Rwanda. Some leaders have implied that they did not know what was
                    going on there. That is not true. We knew exactly what was going on and took no
                    effective action</p>
                <p>Q: Didn't it happen so quickly that, to be realistic, even if everybody had been
                    on board, it would have been pretty hard to get anything in place?</p>
                <p>WARD: That's a factor. The violence started fast and spread fast, but it did take
                    a couple of weeks to engulf the whole country. I don't agree with Canadian
                    General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of the UN peacekeeping force, who said if
                    he had had an effective brigade, he could have stopped the genocide. I'm not
                    sure that that would have been possible. But I do tend to think that a force
                    with heavy firepowethat would connote something like at least APCs and attack
                    helicopterhad been inserted quickly, some of the violence could have been
                    stopped. Only the U.S. could have provided such a force on short notice. We
                    chose not to do so basically because we had not recovered from the debacle in
                    Mogadishu. The genocide in Rwanda ended only when the Rwandan Patriotic Front
                    succeeded militarily. They came in and won the civil war. Then all the Hutu
                    extremists and their people became refugees in Eastern Zaire around Goma. This
                    produced a large humanitarian emergency. Q: There were reports of hundreds of
                    thousands of Hutu refugees out in a rather barren area of the Eastern Congo and
                    scattered around and inside that were genocidal Hutu troops. It made a very
                    complicated situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WARD: It led to a very complicated situation. The way we intervened showed just
                    how complicated it was. When the extent of the humanitarian disaster around Goma
                    became clear, we realized that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees wouldn't be
                    able to deal logistically with the situation effectively on her own. The only
                    agency able to deliver food fast enough to relieve the starvation was the United
                    States Air Force. So, our forces went in to Goma with a huge relief effort that
                    lasted for a few weeks. They were pulled out without interagency consultation
                    just as rapidly as they had gone in. I was at an interagency meeting in which
                    most people around the table thought they were there to extend the U.S. military
                    mission in Goma. When we woke up the next morning, our forces were gone from
                    Goma. Granted, it was a very tenuous situation. You did have the potential for
                    violence with the Hutu militias. You also had the moral dilemma of feeding
                    people who had a lot of blood on their hands from the slaughter of the Tutsis.
                    The new government of Rwanda, which was Tutsi-led, put together a program to
                    allow refugees to return and many did return. Many of them returned under
                    international supervision without excessive violence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It went quite well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Compared to what had preceded. Compared to the fact that hundreds of
                    thousands of Tutsis had been killed, it worked very well. But the militias
                    remained in the eastern Congo and sowed the seeds for the war that later began
                    in the Congo and continues today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could the Air Force or the Army just plain pull out?
                        It's governmental thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's a good question. I'm sure there is a story there, but they just
                    left, and some very high level folks were surprised. They left UNHCR with a
                    first-class security problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the various NGOs that were
                        involvein that? Did you have anything to do with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I didn't really. My colleague in the Bureau, Melinda Kimble, who was Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for the social and economic side of the United Nations, did
                    more with the NGOs. I think at the time it was clear that the NGOs were the
                    principal implementers of the relief policy and they were pretty courageous and
                    doing it as best they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other areas? There had been peacekeeping
                        iCambodia and the Middle East, the Kurds...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>WARD: The Kurdish operation was not a United Nations peacekeeping operation. It
                    was a U.S. coalition operation that was maintained under that controversial
                    resolution, UN Security Council Resolution 688. This was the resolution that we
                    used in the immediate aftermath of the war to belatedly protect the Shiites. It
                    was used to set up both the northern and the southern no-fly zones in Iraq. It
                    also became the justification for the Provide Comfort operation, which provided
                    aid and protection to the Kurds. It was a continuation of the coalition's
                    wartime authority. At least the British and the United States interpreted it
                    that way. The Russians, the Chinese, and to some extent the French disagreed
                    with that interpretation and felt that 688 had lapsed. Those differences on the
                    interpretation of UNSCR 688 lie at the root of the contention over Iraq
                    policy.</p>
                <p>There were many other peacekeeping operations. I don't think it would be
                    worthwhile to go through each one. The ones that dominated were Bosnia, Somalia,
                    and Rwanda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the United Nations as an
                        organizatioin your bailiwick, peacekeeping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: At the time, there were 185 members. There are now 190. The United Nations
                    often acts exactly as you would think a committee made up of 185 members would
                    act. It is not efficient, and it never will be in a strict sense because it is a
                    coalition of many sovereign voices. The Secretariat is a melting pot of
                    nationalities. Under Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was the head of
                    peacekeeping operations in that era, always impressed me. Boutros Boutros-Ghali
                    was Secretary General. He was our choice, albeit a compromise, as Secretary
                    General, but soon proved very disappointing from the American point of view,
                    especially to Madeleine Albright. In 1992, he published a booklet called the
                    Agenda for Peace, which was revised in 1995. The Agenda for Peace still stands
                    as a very important document because it defines what we mean by peace
                    operations. So, that was a positive contribution made by Boutros-Ghali. He later
                    proved to be an obstacle in many ways for United States policy. Madeleine
                    Albright in particular did not get along with him. In the case of Somalia, it is
                    fair to say that he pursued Egyptian interests at the expense of international
                    ones.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Even though the UN peacekeeping operation remained problematic, it came a long
                    way under the direction of Kofi Annan. I remember that during the Cambodian
                    peacekeeping operation in 1992, the UN Special Representative for Cambodia,
                    Akashi, came to Washington for a talk. He commented that when he called up UN
                    headquarters from Cambodia, there was no one to answer the phone because of the
                    time difference. That predated the establishment of the Department of
                    Peacekeeping Operations. There was no operations center or watch officer system.
                    To get action, the Special Representative would have to contact Under Secretary
                    General for Political Affairs Goulding. God forbid that Goulding might be out
                    for the evening. If he was, there was no way to get instructions. There were no
                    secure communications. One of the initiatives taken by the Bush administration
                    and continued by the Clinton administration was to set up the Department of
                    Peacekeeping Operations and then to equip it with a 24-hour operations center.
                    During the time I was involved, one of the positive things that happened was
                    that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, DPKO, became more and more
                    capable. They set up secure communications. They set up rudimentary methods of
                    information exchange. The UN doesn't deal with intelligence, but they will take
                    information. So, things like that were done. Things started to get better. The
                    U.S. and other developed countries seconded at their own expense about 100
                    military officers to DPKO. That really started to tighten things up.
                    Unfortunately, the powerful non-aligned bloc (G-77) in the General Assembly took
                    umbrage at the dominance of developed-world personnel in DPKO. After I left the
                    IO bureau, the G-77 succeeded in forcing DPKO to get rid of all those people who
                    were seconded. DPKO basically deflated almost overnight, and lost a great deal
                    of capability. A year ago, I heard that two people in New York were supervising
                    something like 8,000 United Nations police worldwide.</p>

                <p>WARD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>Q: There has been a lot of talk about Jim Baker, our Secretary of State, saying,
                    “We don't have a dog in that fight.” Many of us, myself included, my visceral
                    reaction was, “God, let's stay out of this thing.” The Europeans were making
                    statements about how, “We're big boys now. We can take care of this.” From the
                    IO perspective, were you seeing the Balkans as a place where you all were going
                    to get involved?</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>WARD: We were involved certainly politically and diplomatically, but you're
                    correct in saying that both in the Bush administration and early in the Clinton
                    administration, there was a tendency to not get involved militarily. That meant
                    leaving the UN in the lead. That meant that we had to be content with an
                    operation that was carried forward at a low level of effectiveness and with
                    insufficient force to even fulfill the limited mandate that existed.</p>
                <p>Q: On either side, we had a couple of young officers who eventually resigned.
                    Interestingly enough, they hadn't served in Yugoslavia, but they felt very
                    strongly that we should do something. What was happening in IO? Were you getting
                    any of this? Or was it still trying to prod the United Nations to do more?</p>
                <p>WARD: We were doing both. We were prodding the United Nations to do more, but I
                    certainly felt myself and dealt within the Bureau with people who felt that we
                    weren't doing enough. I can remember at one point sending a memo forward
                    recommending that we take a much more forceful stance in the UN, insisting on
                    fulfillment of the Chapter Seven mandate. One of the key United Nations Security
                    Council Resolutions for Yugoslavia actually gave UNPROFOR in the former
                    Yugoslavia a Chapter Seven mandate, but it was interpreted in a way that the
                    mandate was never used. I remember a conversation with the general in charge of
                    United Nations forces in which I commented, “Well, you had a Chapter Seven
                    mandate to exercise if you wished.” He disputed that, saying there was no
                    Chapter Seven mandate, and that they only had Chapter Six authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Chapter Six is the part of the United Nations charter that deals with the
                    peaceful settlement of disputes. Chapter Six had been the traditional
                    justification for pure peacekeeping operations, ones in which the mission of the
                    peacekeeping force is simply to separate and perhaps to disarm and demobilize
                    the combatants, but not to use force except to protect itself, self-defense.
                    Chapter Seven of the UN charter deals with challenges to peace and security. It
                    has been used as the legal basis for peace enforcement operations. The UN could
                    have been doing peace enforcement in the Balkans, but limited itself to
                    peacekeeping in part because the United Nations commanders and the United
                    Nations special representatives to the Secretary General felt that they did not
                    have the military strength to do more than that.</p>
                <p>Q: There was horrendous example after horrendous example of what were warlords,
                    particularly on the Serbian side, around Sarajevo, who were pushing the United
                    Nations aside. It seemed like the United Nations' main object was to keep out of
                    the line of fire and maybe even prolong the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>WARD: The historical record will show that Milosevic managed the actions of the
                    Bosnia Serbs pretty skillfully from Belgrade. They did shove the UN around from
                    time to time. Milosevic successfully modulated his bullying so as never to
                    create a situation in which the UN would have been forced to act against him in
                    a definitive way. He managed on the one hand to wage what some have called
                    genocide while at the same time maintaining decent diplomatic relations with all
                    the players in this game.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: The European Union discussed the matter extensively in its political fora.
                    They basically operated through the United Nations. No decisive actions were
                    agreed until the situation degenerated to a point at which the plight of the
                    Bosnian Muslims trapped in Sarajevo became truly dramatic. The pace of Serb
                    ethnic cleansing picked up and Serb forces used force to attempt to cow the UN
                    peacekeeping force into acquiescence. When the Serbs took UN peacekeepers
                    hostage, NATO finally intervened, at first with air strikes, which caused the
                    Serbs to become more entrenched and take more hostages and put them at sites
                    that they felt likely to be bombed, and finally with the Rapid Reaction Force,
                    which for the first time placed NATO combatant forces on the ground with the
                    mission of breaking the siege around Sarajevo, which was done successfully. Then
                    concurrently, there was a major effort underway to strengthen the Croatian army
                    using private U.S. resources, companies basically made up of retired American
                    and other military personnel who trained the Croatian army to the point where
                    the Croatians were able to launch an offensive against Serb forces in the Knin
                    area, causing the Serb population to flee and for the first time introducing
                    into Milosevic's calculation the possibility that he might be militarily
                    defeated. All of these factors drove the situation toward the Dayton
                    negotiation.</p>

                <p>WARD: The role of IO before the operation became a NATO operation was to manage
                    Security Council business and U.S. participation and support for peacekeeping
                    operations. We were involved in writing an interminable series of Security
                    Council resolutions. That business was a fairly disheartening endeavor because
                    we made a lot of empty threats. The Security Council was forever instructing the
                    Secretary General to take steps in peacekeeping without providing the resources.
                    For example, there was a resolution passed in late 1994 to protect so-called
                    safe areas within Bosnia. Certain towns that were under extreme military
                    pressure from the Serbs were designated as safe areas, among them Srebrenica.
                    Tragically, some of these towns became the opposite of safe areas. An expansion
                    of UNPROFOR for the purpose of protecting the safe areas was authorized. The
                    Security Council instructed the Secretary General to get the job done. The fact
                    is that hardly any country volunteered to provide the extra forces needed for
                    the operation. So, the UN, even when it had the will, did not have the
                    wherewithal. There were few profiles in courage during this period.</p>
                <p>Q: What was this doing to you and your coworkers? You've got a situation which,
                    if nothing else, was seen on TV with snipers, particularly Serbian snipers,
                    happily shooting at women running across the street. Then you had things like
                    the marketplace explosion and then Srebrenica, which killed about 5,000 and was
                    a real genocide, where Dutch troops were too few and didn't act very well.
                    Whatever it was, it didn't work out well. But here you have what appears to be a
                    Congress that's not giving you much support. In fact, Congress is spending most
                    of its time going after the UN, going after government workers. They were pretty
                    nasty people. This was the Newt Gingrich revolution. This had to have some
                    effect on you.</p>
                <p>WARD: I stayed in IO for four years. I find multilateral diplomacy interesting, a
                    fascinating multi-tiered game. In my view, the U.S. government did not lead in
                    the way we should have early in the Yugoslav episode. A lot of people should
                    share in the blame. We were driven by events rather than driving them. We had
                    the wherewithal, especially early in the game, to militarily dominate the
                    situation. We failed to do it. The kind of military force that was later used,
                    if used earlier, would have saved many lives. The Serb forces in Bosnia were
                    never large, nor were they very effective militarily.</p>
                <p>Q: As an old Yugoslav hand, it seemed like the Serbs spent an awful lot of their
                    time sitting on top of hills shooting at artillery in a haphazard way like a
                    bunch of mountaineer rednecks.</p>
                <p>WARD: You can think of them as mountaineer rednecks or simply thugs who were
                    bound together in a cause. Had they encountered serious military force, I just
                    have to believe the situation would have been very different. At one point,
                    having read an analysis that showed something like 30,000 Serb troops on the
                    ground in Bosnia, I asked the three-star general who was the J-3 at the Joint
                    Staff, “What would it take to defeat this force?” He said, “About 100,000
                    people.” I said, “That would be possible for NATO.” He said, “Yes.” The reason
                    it didn't happen is political.</p>

                <p>WARD: The war in the Gulf was over. We had the military capability,but there was
                    no political consensus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a major military contingent in Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: That's right. The drawdown had not yet progressed to the point where it is
                    today. Another problem was the rocky beginning to the relationship between the
                    new Clinton administration and our military leaders. We've all read about the
                    general who was confronted by a young Clinton administration staffer who said,
                    “Around here, we don't like the military” or something like that. I don't know
                    for a fact that that was true, but I did see instances in which political
                    appointees demonstrated a profound lack of understanding for the military, its
                    culture and its capabilities. Once the military stiffened and made it clear that
                    they didn't like to be treated that way, the civilians began to run scared. A
                    great deal of deference was shown to the military. Of course, the generals were
                    not interested in getting involved in another war.</p>

                <p>WARD: They were worried and with some justification that unless they made the
                    case for not intervening, they would be sent in everywhere. I heard in
                    interagency meetings beyond Yugoslavia all sorts of proposals for the U.S.
                    military to do this and tha“While you're not busy elsewhere, could you go down
                    to this country and fix this situation?” So, there was a lack of good
                    communication. There was a lot of misunderstanding and distrust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of IO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The Assistant Secretary at the beginning of the Clinton administration was
                    Doug Bennett. I was acting from January through May 1993. Doug came on in May
                    1993. He left in May 1995. Then I was acting from May 1995 to the time I left in
                    1996. Doug was offered the presidency of Wesleyan University, and, as an
                    alumnus, jumped at it. He is a wonderful man and a real idealist who believed in
                    the United Nations. He was chagrined at the refusal of the Congress, but also of
                    the Clinton administration, to exercise the political will needed to support the
                    United Nations and to support multilateral peacekeeping.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Q: You were in an interesting position. I somehow have the feeling that IO has
                    been staffed by people with just regular assignments such as you, but also a
                    cadre of true believers in the UN within the State Department complex. Did you
                    find that they were oriented towards military intervention? Was it a hard group
                    to deal with?</p>
                <p>WARD: The IO Bureau is about 50% Civil Service and 50% Foreign Service. There are
                    more civil servants than in many other policy bureaus. Most of the Civil Service
                    people dealt with the economic, social, and developmental aspects of the United
                    Nations. They were committed to the UN. I didn't necessarily go to IO as an
                    advocate of the United Nations, but I believed it could be a useful instrument
                    of U.S. foreign policy. I do remember being interested in the UN even as a
                    child. My aunt and mother took me to hear Dwight Eisenhower address the General
                    Assembly. I thought that was a pretty neat thing. I didn't find difficulty in
                    working with the group in IO. We had a good group of people. Because
                    peacekeeping was seen as an important endeavor, we attracted to the offices that
                    dealt with UN political issues, specifically the Office of UN Political Affairs
                    (IO/UNP) and the Office of Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Operations (IO/PHO), a
                    new office that I was able to start, some very good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you had American military seconded to the United
                        Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been a frustration for them, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: There were some grounds for optimism and inspiration. During this time, we
                    made an effort to upgrade and professionalize the Department of Peacekeeping
                    Operations in the United Nations Secretariat, and we seconded dozens of American
                    officers to the UN, where they had the great challenge of setting up a real
                    military headquarters. They put together a situation center, for example. We
                    gave the UN communications equipment that it didn't have before, and put the
                    United Nations in a position at least to begin to control forces over distances
                    of thousands of miles. American officers who had been assigned to the United
                    Nations as observers in peacekeeping operations, for example in the Middle East,
                    became quite committed to the role of military observers in keeping the peace.
                    We should also not forget that even in the Balkan context, there was one very
                    successful operation, and that was UNPREDEP in Macedonia. That was the first and
                    up to now only force dispatched by the UN to prevent a conflict, in this case a
                    Serbian invasion of Macedonia. We had an American infantry unit in UNPREDEP. It
                    worked quietly and very well. Congress was happy with it. The presence of the
                    Americans in that force was a key factor in preventing Serb aggression.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Q: Was there concern on the military and also the civilian side about the
                    political people calling too many shots? Once you insert military, then you
                    start having the lawyers and the politicians, which is usually a negative
                    factor.</p>
                <p>WARD: There was always a lot of debate about objectives and end states.
                    Naturally, the military wants to know its objective. Civilians sometimes have a
                    hard time understanding that if you give a military force a mission, you have to
                    be very clear about the objective and state exactly what it is you want them to
                    achieve. That is the way they operate. Because the civilian side was so
                    indistinct and difficult to read, the military began to be very fearful of
                    undertaking new missions. When I say “military,” I mean Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    They began to ask questions about things like desired end states and exit
                    strategies. That debate became fairly counterproductive. In any military
                    situation, whether it's peacekeeping or war, the exact timing and circumstances
                    of the conclusion cannot be predicted. You can define objectives, but you can't
                    define in advance the end state. The debates on the subject often became very
                    time consuming and resulted in inaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say the military was getting more and more demanding.
                        Howere we reacting to this? What role were you all playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It depended upon the peacekeeping operation. In the Balkans, the IO role
                    diminished very sharply when NATO assumed operational control from the UN. The
                    European Bureau managed the Dayton negotiations. It was not a United Nations
                    show in any way, shape, or form. The UN was asked to pass certain resolutions at
                    the end. In other peacekeeping operations, we maintained a very active role. We
                    often found ourselves paradoxically asking the tough questions that we felt the
                    regional bureaus didn't ask when they demanded peacekeeping operations. There
                    were some operations that we felt ought to have been curtailed or shut down. We
                    were under pressure from the Congress to close down some operations. One
                    particularly unpopular operation on Capitol Hill at the time was the one in the
                    Western Sahara, which had gone nowhere for years. The dispute was between
                    Morocco and the Polisario Liberation Front, which wanted to create a Saharawi
                    Republic. Both sides sought to manipulate the UN, and neither was interested in
                    serious negotiations. From the IO point of view, we felt that the Near East
                    Bureau should have been more willing to put pressure on the government of
                    Morocco to create a real peace process. Likewise, we felt that some of the
                    Middle East observer operations should have been downsized to save some money.
                    In some of the African operations, we were very conscious of the costs over the
                    duration of the operation.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get involved peripherally in our Sinai force, which was not under the
                    United Nations for pretty obvious reasons. Going back to the '67 War, the
                    Israelis had no faith in the United Nations, but yet in a way it was all part
                    and parcel of the same thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WARD: You're correct. That was not a UN operation, so it didn't fall under the
                    United Nations budget. We were not involved in the Sinai force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the Balkans, what happened on the ground in
                        thBalkans that got NATO into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It was a progressive process driven by events. After the atrocity in the
                    market in Sarajevo and with the constant sniping at innocents in the streets of
                    that city, the U.S. and our closest allies decided that NATO military
                    intervention was necessary. NATO indicated to the United Nations that it was
                    willing to put together the Rapid Reaction Force, which consisted in large part
                    of British artillery and U.S. airpower. There were some British troops on the
                    ground also. That force was authorized by the UN to break the siege of Sarajevo.
                    Even then, it was very tough to get money through the Congress. I remember the
                    day when we had a call from the Secretary's office saying that Richard Holbrooke
                    and I had to go up to the Senate to testify about the proposed appropriation to
                    fund the Rapid Reaction Force. It was an interesting experience to go up to the
                    Hill with Richard Holbrooke, who was of course the center of attention at the
                    hearing. He succeeded in freeing up the money for the Force, but the Congress
                    eventually placed stringent limitations on our ability to spend money for
                    peacekeeping. Perhaps influenced to some degree by opinions they heard from U.S.
                    military sources, Senators grilled us about objectives, end states, and exit
                    strategies. They wanted us to predict the future in some detail.</p>
                <p>After the Rapid Reaction Force was deployed, the situation in Sarajevo improved,
                    but there was another setback yet to comthe massacre in Srebrenica. The Dutch
                    UNPROFOR battalion in Srebrenica was nervous. They felt isolated and knew that
                    other peacekeepers had been held hostage. They had been deployed to Srebrenica
                    in fulfillment of the Secretary General's pledge to create and protect “safe
                    areas” for Bosniacs (Bosnian Muslims). However, they did not have the strength
                    necessary to fulfill their mission. A much larger force of Serbs surrounded
                    them. To make matters worse, Bosniac militants used the safe areas as bases from
                    which to launch attacks against Serbs. The Serbs succeeded in surrounding
                    Srebrenica and demanded that the Dutch leave. The Dutch finally complied,
                    leaving vulnerable the people they had been protecting. As we all know,
                    thousands of men and boys were killed either on the spot or as they attempted to
                    make their way back to Bosniac lines. That massacre was an action-forcing event
                    that led to increased NATO and U.S. willingness to use force and also helped
                    convince us to use our diplomatic clout in order to put together a real peace
                    negotiation.</p>

                <p>WARD: Some of the newly elected Republicans probably could be described as
                    isolationist, but I don't think that characterized the Republican leadership in
                    Congress. In fact, we worked constructively at a staff level with Gingrich's
                    people on the so-called “grand bargain” that would have tied payment by the U.S.
                    of our arrears in the UN budget to the administration's acceptance of more
                    stringent rules for making decisions on peacekeeping operations and efforts to
                    reduce the UN's budget. We made a great deal of progress with the Gingrich staff
                    on that issue. At the State Department, this was an effort that was backed by
                    Secretary Christopher. Every time we got back from a meeting with Gingrich's
                    staff, we did a report for Christopher. He looked at the materials that we were
                    presenting. We put together a dog and pony show of facts and figures about the
                    UN for Gingrich's people. At one point, in 1995, we were awfully close an
                    agreement in principle, but the President needed to make a phone call to the
                    Republican leadership. That phone call just never happened. It seemed to me at
                    the time that the political air was so poisonous that both sides preferred
                    maintaining their dispute to resolving it. In fact, the agreement on paying our
                    UN dues that happened years later was very close to what we had come up with.
                    Perhaps partisanship receded a bit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Certainly at the time he was no friend of the UN, although I guess he and
                    Madeleine Albright later got on pretty well. Every month, I had to go up to the
                    Hill and testify to the staff on UN peacekeeping. At some point, the Republican
                    staff on the Senate side got the idea that they needed to hold us to exactly
                    what we said. They began using a court reporter at the briefings. We were not
                    required to testify under oath, but they created a transcript of each of these
                    meetings. They gave us an opportunity to review and change the record. I say
                    that to illustrate that there was a certain amount of mistrust. I always had
                    good personal relations with everyone on Senator Helms' staff. I felt that we
                    were all basically interested in the good of the nation, but they certainly were
                    distrustful of the administration's intentions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: I had been in IO for four years and decided that either I was going to stay
                    there forever, or I'd have to find another assignment. The system seemed quite
                    willing to leave me there forever. It was, however, a pretty strenuous job, and
                    you only have so much energy.I began to look around for a chief of mission
                    assignment. In 1996, there were no attractive opportunities in Europe. I
                    thought, well, I'd really like to go to a place that had been the site of a
                    successful UN peacekeeping operation. After having sometimes felt like I was
                    banging my head up against a wall on the subject of peacekeeping, I wanted to
                    see where it had been successful. There was an opportunity to do that in
                    Namibia. I expressed a preference to be assigned as chief of mission in Namibia,
                    and luckily I was appointed after the usual lengthy process. I think the process
                    started in October 1995. I didn't go out to post until July 1996.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. Namibia was for several decades a German colony. It was placed under
                    South African control by a League of Nations mandate after World War I, having
                    been occupied by a British/South African force during World War I. The League of
                    Nations mandate was taken over by the UN when the UN was created, but South
                    Africa violated the terms of the mandate and the UN's relationship with South
                    Africa deteriorated from 1945. It reached a point at which the UN declared South
                    Africa's role in Namibia to be illegal. That didn't change anything right away,
                    but over time it meant that the UN began to support at least politically the
                    liberation forces in Namibia, the Southwest African People's Organization
                    (SWAPO), which started as the Ovambo People's Liberation Organization. By the
                    late 1970s, with Cuban forces in Angola, SWAPO began to use Angola as a safe
                    haven. They began to wage a guerrilla war against the South Africans, who turned
                    Namibia into a military bastion for operations in Angola. All along Namibia's
                    northern border, you find these airfields with 10,000 runways, which you usually
                    don't find around Africa. In the early '80s, at the beginning of the Reagan
                    administration, a young Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs named
                    Chester Crocker was appointed. Crocker saw ending the war as his primary task.
                    Chet became a power broker, a mediator, and a protagonist in the Southern
                    African conflict. He negotiated with the South Africans, the Russians, the
                    Cubans, the Angolans, and others in search of an agreement. He worked through a
                    so-called Contact Group of Western nations and succeeded in bringing the
                    conflict to a conclusion. As a result, Namibia became independent on March 21,
                    1990. By then, the leader of SWAPO, Sam Nujoma, was already head of the Namibian
                    constituent assembly. When the assembly approved the new constitution, Nujoma
                    became president. Parliament was elected through free and fair elections.
                    Namibia was launched. When I got there, Namibia was six years old.</p>

                        interests.What was the state of relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>WARD: Namibia was an interesting place. Many of Namibia's leaders had been
                    educated in the U.S. because they were sent to American universities under UN
                    scholarships. For example, the Namibian foreign minister is married to an
                    American. He has a degree from an American university. The Namibian prime
                    minister has a degree from an American university. That was also the case with
                    several others. There was degree of acquaintance and familiarity with the U.S.
                    that was unusual in Africa. At the same time, in the back of their minds, they
                    remembered that we had not supported their liberation cause through much of
                    their struggle. In fact, the U.S. had pursued a policy called “constructive
                    engagement” with South Africa. The Namibians felt that constructive engagement
                    with South Africa meant destructive engagement for them. So, there was both
                    warmth and a little bit of distance. You're correct in saying that the U.S.
                    interests in the area were limited. Our interest was in stability, in keeping
                    Namibia in the democratic column in Africa, where they were not many countries
                    on that side. When I went there, Namibia was one of the two or three democracies
                    on the continent of Africa. Namibia was a place where there was a free press, a
                    free judiciary, where the government regularly lost cases in court and accepted
                    defeat, where the press criticized the government and was not shut down. Over
                    time, unfortunately, the trends in Namibia did not develop in a positive way in
                    any of those areas. I saw increasing attempts to intimidate the press, attempts
                    by the executive to stretch the constitution. But all in all, Namibia remained a
                    democracy, a place where people lived without fear of the government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our embassy like as a mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The mission was quite small. There were about 25 Americans, including 12
                    from State and a USAID mission. The USAID mission had quite a number of FSN
                    employees. There were around 100 employees total in the Mission. We also had a
                    large Peace Corps contingent. At one time, it was as high as 140 volunteers, one
                    of the largest programs in Africa. The USAID program focused on education,
                    environment, and the development of civil society. Because the Windhoek embassy
                    was organized when our foreign affairs budget was on a shoestring, we had a
                    limited FSN staff and few resources. The theory was that the embassy would
                    contract out for services. That turned out to be one of the more frustrating
                    parts of running the mission. Possibilities of contracting out in an effective
                    manner, even in a place as well developed as Windhoek, were limited. So, you had
                    to live from day to day.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>WARD: There are two deserts in Namibia, which is twice the size of California.
                    The Kalahari Desert is shared with Botswana and South Africa. The Kalahari
                    Desert is a scrub desert. There is the occasional tree and grass. Then there is
                    the Namib Desert, which is a typical sand desert. It is one of the most stable
                    geological formations in the world. It hasn't changed in millions of years. That
                    desert runs right down to the sea. Windhoek, the capital, is located on the
                    large central plain, which is 5,000-6,000 feet high. The plain is a dry savanna,
                    which also looks a lot like a desert to the uninitiated. It's a country with
                    quite a few resources. There are diamonds, natural gas, and uranium. They have a
                    large fishing industry. They have a coastline with a couple of interesting
                    German-flavored towns on it. The population is under two million. If the
                    Namibians can keep their act together on the economic side and maintain a free
                    political system, they could have a bright future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: It really depended on which issue. I was told when I got there, “Don't deal
                    with the Namibian military. They're hopeless.” I soon discovered that one of the
                    highest priority issues for the country was getting rid of land mines and
                    unexploded ordnance left over from the war. This was an area in which the U.S.
                    military could help. In fact, my predecessor had asked the U.S. European Command
                    to send Special Forces advisers and instructors to train the Namibian army in
                    de-mining techniques. I continued and intensified the program, and persuaded the
                    State Department and the U.S. European Command to sign on to a common goal that
                    Namibia should be made mine-safe. If we were successful, Namibia would be the
                    first African country to complete a de-mining program. By the way, we avoided
                    the use of the term “mine free,” because that would imply that we could be
                    successful in removing every one of the hundreds of thousands of land mines that
                    were present in the country. We used instead the term “mine safe,” which was a
                    UN standard. With the help of the U.S. Army, especially the Special Forces, and
                    funding from the Department of State, we pulled together enough resources for a
                    comprehensive de-mining program that was accompanied by a thorough public
                    affairs effort on the dangers of land mines and unexploded ordnance. We worked
                    closely with the Namibian Defense Ministry and the Namibian Defense Force. In
                    both cases, I was surprised and pleased by their effectiveness and
                    professionalism. I found working with them to be quite easy. They delivered on
                    promises.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>For example, the year before I arrived in Namibia, a Special Forces team taught a
                    de-mining course for Namibian military engineers. Just before September 30,
                    1995, the team got an emergency call from Washington with orders to pull out
                    immediately because funding would run out at the end of the fiscal year. The
                    team left forthwith. Subsequently, the Namibians used the training and the
                    equipment that they had been given and went out on their own and cleared about
                    half the minefields in the country. When I got there, we brought a team back and
                    did some more training. The Namibians then completed the de-mining of 10 large
                    minefields. Then we went on to the next phase, which was clearing the mines
                    around 500 electrical pylons along a 250-kilometer electric power line that
                    stretched through a remote area of the country. Again, the Namibian Defense
                    Force performed very, very well.</p>
                <p>Dealing with the Namibian foreign ministry was a different story. I remembered
                    the other day in the wake of these terrorist attacks that every year we were
                    asked by the State Department to urge the Namibian government to ratify ten
                    terrorism covenants that had been agreed on internationally. Every year, I would
                    go in to see the Foreign Minister along with allied ambassadors and make a
                    strong case on the importance of ratifying the agreements forthwith. He would
                    promise that they would do it right away. The next year, we would go and do the
                    same thing again because nothing had been done. I checked just the other day
                    with my successor and found that they never got around to ratifying the
                    covenants. So, other parts of the government were less efficient than the
                    Defense Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they able to deliver services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: They did in most cases. When you visit Windhoek, you see a First World
                    city. In fact, Windhoek is amazingly clean. There is hardly any litter. They
                    have a tradition of good mayors and officials who care about the city. They have
                    events like Citizens Cleanup Day. Even the shantytown areas of Katatura, which
                    was the “township” for Blacks during the days of Apartheid - are supplied with
                    basic services. Potable water was available not only in Windhoek, but in most
                    towns throughout the country. There were reasonable standards of healthcare.
                    Services were delivered. Unfortunately, the healthcare system is breaking down
                    under the pressure of the AIDS epidemic, which is just overwhelming the country.
                    The school system needs work because standards of education for the Black
                    majority under Apartheid were disgraceful. Mathematics, for example, was
                    intentionally taught poorly if at all to Blacks. We had major assistance
                    programs for elementary and secondary education. We were trying to help the
                    Namibians transition from a system based on rote learning to more modern
                    standards. Progress was slow, but there was a great hunger for learning
                    throughout the population.</p>

                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>WARD: One of Mandela's first acts that earned him a lot of gratitude in Namibia
                    was to give Walvis Bay to Namibia without asking any payment in return. Walvis
                    Bay was a South African enclave on the Namibian coast. It was a port and home to
                    a significant fishing fleet. Walvis Bay had never been Namibian. It had been
                    historically an offshoot of the Cape colony. So, in giving it to Namibia,
                    Mandela was really extending the hand of friendship. And giving it debt-free was
                    quite extraordinary. In the background, however, there was a love-hate
                    relationship between Namibia and South Africa. Namibia was dependent upon South
                    Africa in many wayit was in a customs union with South Africa, the Namibian
                    dollar was kept at par with the South African Rand, and South African farms
                    supplied Namibia with foodstuffs. Namibia was self-sufficient only in meat.
                    Because of the linkage with the Rand, Namibia can't exercise its own monetary
                    policy except to a very limited extent. A lot of Namibians go to university in
                    South Africa. President Nujoma of Namibia was not particularly close to Nelson
                    Mandela, although he respected him. Mandela was not his type. Unfortunately,
                    President Nujoma in recent years has decided to emulate Robert Mugabe rather
                    than Mandela, a bad choice in several ways.</p>

                <p>WARD: HIV/AIDS is a retrovirus that destroys the immune system. At this point,
                    there is no vaccine for it and no cure. There are palliatives that will extend
                    the life of AIDS patients, but they are very expensive. When I got to Namibia,
                    the disease was just beginning to make significant inroads. Because of the way
                    USAID works, it is very difficult for an ambassador to access foreign assistance
                    funds rapidly for emergency purposes. The amounts of money available for
                    contingency purposes were ridiculously small. We had a few large USAID programs,
                    but they were all programmed on a long-term basis. Making changes, even small
                    ones, was like turning a super-tanker. I was lucky enough to have a very
                    creative political officer named Louis Mazel, who had begun a program aimed at
                    curbing gender violence and raising AIDS awareness. We funded the program with
                    our allocation of human rights funds. The program cost surprisingly little
                    money, on the order of $100,000 per year, but had far-reaching results. The
                    problems of violence against women and children and the HIV/AIDS epidemic were
                    closely linked. We convinced the State Department to let us use our human rights
                    fund to launch a multimedia campaign on violence against women and children. In
                    fact, Lou Mazel won the State Department's first Human Rights Award for that
                    program. I supported and continued it after Lou left. The Namibian government
                    was inactive, virtually inert, on the HIV/AIDS issue, and HIV/AIDS sufferers
                    were being ostracized. The Namibians were in denial with regard to HIV/AIDS. The
                    newspapers carried many obituaries of young and middle-aged people each week,
                    but no one was reported as dying of AIDS. They either died “suddenly” or “after
                    a long illness.” HIV/AIDS was sometimes referred to as the “wasting disease.”
                    HIV/AIDS sufferers were shunned by their neighbors in Windhoek and would return
                    to their home villages. There, they would again find rejection and isolation.
                    People were dying of AIDS under trees out in the bush.Amidst all this, one young
                    woman had the courage to admit that she was HIV positive. She was a very
                    articulate young woman. Her name was Emma. As part of our human rights campaign,
                    we launched an effort against the ostracism of HIV/AIDS sufferers. We made a
                    film called “Emma's Story,” which made the point that HIV/AIDS positive people
                    were still alive and that they could contribute to society. That film was quite
                    a success. It was placed in every Namibian school. It helped improve the quality
                    of life for at least some HIV/AIDS sufferers. Despite our urging, however, the
                    government still basically did nothing. The president's son, according to
                    well-founded rumors, died of AIDS. The president never spoke out on the issue.
                    He never talked about the need to use condoms. Until very late in the game, he
                    never talked about even the desirability of abstinence. By then, upwards of 25
                    percent of the sexually active population was HIV-positive.</p>

                <p>WARD: That's a very good question. You probably need a psychiatrist to answer it.
                    I have a theory based on my short but intense experience in Africa. African
                    leaders feel the need to fulfill the role of the “big man,” the equivalent of
                    the tribal chief, a man (and it is always a man) who can solve every problem
                    brought to him. That's not true with HIV/AIDS. It's a problem they can't solve,
                    can't even promise to solve. Because they cannot solve it, they deny its
                    existence or attribute AIDS to outside causes. Nujoma, who is not instinctively
                    a friend of the U.S., on a couple of occasions gave speeches outside the country
                    in which he stated that HIV/AIDS was a product of the American biological
                    weapons program, aimed specifically at Africa. That sort of attitude is a way of
                    deflecting responsibility, a way of deflecting attention away from that fact
                    that even though he is the leader of the country, he really is not able to do
                    anything effectively to alleviate the suffering that AIDS has brought. Of
                    course, there is no excuse for failing to accept help from any quarter to help
                    AIDS victims, and Nujoma and other African leaders have fallen woefully short of
                    the mark. I was also disappointed with American performance on HIV/AIDS. USAID
                    had only a very small HIV/AIDS program in Namibia. It didn't seem to be
                    interested in a larger one. The UN had a more effective program. USAID's excuse
                    seemed to be that the Namibian government wasn't demanding help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the health authorities? Were they taking their
                        cufrom the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: Yes. The health authorities first of all had limited means. The best
                    hospitals in Namibia are private hospitals, but few Black AIDS victims have the
                    means to pay. The public hospitals were overwhelmed. The health minister told me
                    in late 1998 that all the resources she had for important purposes such as
                    malaria control and polio vaccination were being used for care of HIV/AIDS
                    patients. Namibia had a very difficult malaria problem in the north, with over
                    400,000 cases annually. People were dying of malaria even though effective
                    treatment was readily available at relatively low cost. The government just did
                    not have the money.</p>
                <p>Q: I understand it to be fairly common in Africa for AIDS to be carried by truck
                    drivers and by rather loose relationships and particularly men going to younger
                    girls because they hope they'll be less likely to have AIDS.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WARD: Yes, that's basically the case. HIV/AIDS in Africa is a heterosexual
                    disease. Transmission by dirty needles wasn't significant in Namibia. It may be
                    in other parts of Africa, but I am not aware of that. In Namibia truck drivers
                    and other travelers spread it. The Caprivi Strip (the part of northern Namibia
                    that is shaped like an arrow going from west to east) is serviced by a
                    hard-surfaced road that has become an important international transportation
                    artery. In large part because of the presence of so many truckers and other
                    travelers, the Caprivi Strip region has the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the
                    country. Traditional customs and practices have also played a role in the spread
                    of the disease. For example, men often refuse to use condoms, believing that the
                    latter detract from their manhood. Traditional healers have been known to share
                    HIV- tainted blood. In other cases, traditional healers have allegedly told
                    HIV-positive men that if they had sex with young virgins they would be cured.
                    Such advice resulted in a wave of rapes of very young girls and even infants,
                    increasing the problem of violence against women and children. We picked that up
                    as one of the themes in our campaign against violence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues between the United States? Were

                </p>
                <p>WARD: The three U.S. interests that I thought paramount were, first, preserving
                    Namibia as a democracy, second, promoting economic development and trade with
                    the U.S., and, third, helping Namibia make a positive contribution to regional
                    security.There were some significant opportunities for American business. These
                    included contracts for offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production.
                    The Namibian government was also very interested in American water desalination
                    technology, and concluded a deal with one U.S. company. We were also active in
                    helping Boeing sell a 747 aircraft to the Namibian national airline, which had a
                    decent business flying passengers and freight to and from Europe. There were
                    some power projects in the northern and southern parts of the country that were
                    of interest to companies such as General Electric, Raytheon, and Fluor. In
                    addition, there was the prospect of American participation in the Namibian
                    fishing industry. Americans were also very influential in the diamond trade in
                    Namibia, and the country's large uranium mine, controlled by Rio Tinto, had
                    long-term supply contracts with U.S. power utilities. Thus, even though the
                    absolute amount of trade with the U.S. was small, it had several components and
                    was growing.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>In the area of regional security, we focused on peacekeeping and de-mining. One
                    of our purposes in training Namibians in de-mining was to put together an
                    indigenous African military de-mining capability that could be used on
                    peacekeeping missions. The Namibian President and Defense Minister were
                    enthusiastic about this project and supported it wholeheartedly. We even talked
                    about establishing a Southern African de-mining academy in Namibia. We were also
                    successful in gaining Namibian participation in a few U.S.-sponsored regional
                    peacekeeping exercises. In one instance, Namibia hosted units from all over
                    Southern Africa for a training course on combat medical care. Between de-mining
                    missions and peacekeeping training, we had an in-country presence of U.S.
                    Special Forces for more than half of my time in Namibia.</p>
                <p>The high degree of interest shown by the U.S. military and especially the U.S.
                    European Command in Namibia contrasted sharply with a rather low degree of
                    interest on the civilian side. Although we had one short visit by Vice President
                    Gore, neither the Secretary nor any Under Secretary nor the Assistant Secretary
                    for African Affairs ever visited Namibia. We did succeed in interesting the
                    State Department Inspector General in a program to help the Namibians avoid the
                    growth of corruption, and the IG visited twice (happily, neither time in an
                    inspection mode). The four-star Deputy Commander of the European Command visited
                    three times, the Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command came once, and
                    several other general officers stopped by.</p>
                <p>I should not leave out mention of one tragedy. On September 13, 1997, a C-141
                    cargo aircraft of the U.S. Air Force delivered a team of Special Forces and
                    several tons of de-mining equipment to Windhoek. The aircraft took off for the
                    return flight to the U.S. on that same day. Tragically, the plane collided at
                    39,000 feet off the coast of Namibia with a German Luftwaffe aircraft that was
                    en route to Cape Town. Despite a large-scale search and rescue effort involving
                    many aircraft from the U.S. and other countries and as many as 200 USAF
                    personnel, no survivors were found from either aircraft.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>A couple of months later, a U.S. trade mission sponsored by the Corporate Council
                    on Africa visited Namibia. I spoke with some of the members about how to
                    commemorate the tragic loss of life. One of the executives, a former career Army
                    officer, offered to take the lead in collecting a fund for the placement of a
                    memorial at the Embassy. With this funding (approved in record time by State
                    Department ethics lawyers) and the cooperation of the Namibian government and
                    the U.S. Air Force, we designed and constructed a monument composed of Namibian
                    granite and a bronze plaque forged in New Jersey (the aircraft had been based at
                    McGuire AFB). President Sam Nujoma dedicated the memorial in the embassy
                    courtyard on March 19, 1998. Representatives of the families of all the deceased
                    American Air Force personnel attended along with a representative of the German
                    government. A Namibian army bugler played taps. It was a sad and emotional
                    moment, paying tribute to military men who had died for a peaceful, humanitarian
                    cause. The next day, my wife Peggy and I joined the family members on a flight
                    in a C-141 out over the Atlantic to the exact location of the crash. The
                    aircraft dropped a memory box and a wreath. Moments like that can never be
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>Two problems that arose later in my tour were of a different nature. First,
                    Namibia joined with Angola and Zimbabwe in sending military forces into the
                    Democratic Republic of the Congo in support of President Kabila. Second, a
                    small, armed rebellion began in the Caprivi Strip. This rebellion was apparently
                    supported by UNITA, the Angolan government's military opponent and, according to
                    rumors, by Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why in God's name did Namibia get involved in the
                        Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I do not think there were any good reasons, but there were some bad ones.
                    President Nujoma insisted he had good reasons, and his logic went something like
                    the following. Namibia has a permanent water shortage. Eventually, it will be
                    necessary to acquire more water either through desalination or other means.
                    Desalination is very expensive and involves reliance on western technologies.
                    Nujoma saw the Congo as a possible source of water. His grand plans for
                    diverting rivers in Angola and the Congo had only a loose connection with real
                    possibilities. Nujoma also saw the Congo as a source of mineral wealth and as a
                    market for goods that could be imported through Namibia and transported along
                    Namibia's excellent road system. Like so many others, Nujoma was fascinated with
                    the idea of getting a piece of the action from mines in the Congo. In the latter
                    dream, Zimbabwean President Mugabe, who acquired extensive personal interests in
                    the Congo, influenced him. At first, this exploitation of natural resources was
                    done very quietly. One only heard rumors, which sounded increasingly
                    credible.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>We counseled Nujoma and any other Namibian official who would listen against
                    military involvement. The single person who seemed to have doubts was the
                    civilian Minister of Defense. His views were overridden by officials in Nujoma's
                    State House and by the uniformed military. By the time I left, however, the
                    Namibians had begun to suffer military deaths from combat and accidents. To his
                    credit, Nujoma did not attempt, unlike Mugabe, to cover up the losses. When the
                    first Zimbabweans were lost in the Congo, their deaths were kept secret, they
                    were buried in the Congo, and their families were simply informed that their
                    loved ones were dead. Namibia is too small a place, too tightly knit, and too
                    democratic for that to happen. The Namibians brought the bodies of their
                    soldiers back and held a state funeral. It was quite a moving event. A UN
                    helicopter had crashed with Namibians on it, a Namibian helicopter had crashed,
                    and they also lost some infantry soldiers. There were about ten dead in all. The
                    state funeral seemed to turn public and official opinion against the war. The
                    government realized that it had made a big mistake by getting involved, but it
                    also wanted to save face. They didn't want to just run away. So, even though
                    they realized they had made a mistake, they stayed in the Congo for more than a
                    year afterwards, albeit avoiding combat to the extent possible. Their dialogue
                    with us about ending the war became much more productive. Howard Wolpe, our
                    special envoy for the African Great Lakes conflict, made a couple of productive
                    visits to Namibia. I enjoyed very much working with Howard.</p>
                <p>Another rough spot was connected with Namibia's election in 1998 as a
                    non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. We supported Namibia's
                    candidacy because we generally support the nominee of the Organization of
                    African Unity for Africa's seats on the Council. Namibia was elected in the fall
                    of 1998 for a term beginning in January 1999. When the State Department asked
                    me, drawing on my UN experience, how I thought Namibia would vote, I said I
                    thought we had trouble ahead. They had a very close friendship with Cuba, close
                    relations with Libya, although there was no Libyan embassy, and a strong
                    historical friendship with Russia as a successor to the Soviet Union. The Soviet
                    Union and Cuba had given them a lot of aid during the liberation struggle. So,
                    on issues that mattered to uterrorism, Iraq, and otherI thought they would be a
                    thorn in our side. In fact, that's exactly what happened. My last months there
                    were spent trying to persuade the Namibian government to consider some of these
                    issues a little more objectively and not to vote by knee jerk.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, just after I returned from post, they took a position against the
                    Security Council Resolution authorizing NATO intervention in Kosovo. They did
                    that for a truly strange reason, basing their position on their experience with
                    the mini-rebellion in the Caprivi Strip. I predicted they would do that, and it
                    turned out to be the case. They saw Kosovo as a breakaway province from
                    Yugoslavia, and therefore a negative example for those in the Caprivi Strip who
                    wanted to break away from Namibia. Talk about all politics being local! Their
                    behavior on the Security Council was really erratic, motivated by idiosyncratic
                    factors and their historical friendships. I was gone for most of their tenure on
                    the Security Council, but the U.S.-Namibian relationship on the Council was not
                    a happy one, despite a later visit to the country by Richard Holbrooke.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this Caprivi Strip rebellion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The rebellion, which was truly a tempest in a teapot, was interesting. The
                    people in the Caprivi Strip are ethnically different from the other ethnic
                    groups in northern Namibia. They are probably more closely related to some of
                    the tribes in Zimbabwe and Zambia than they are to most Namibians. In addition,
                    the people in the Caprivi Strip have been historically friendly to UNITA, the
                    Angolan rebels. Although I don't think the history of this will necessarily ever
                    be written, it looks the rebels were assisted by UNITA and perhaps by some
                    people in Botswana. Namibia's relations with Botswana were not always very
                    friendly. Of course, the idea of an independent Caprivi Strip is ludicrous. The
                    Strip is totally landlocked, and was created by colonial edict at the Conference
                    of Berlin in 1884 because the Germans wanted to have a channel of communication
                    between their colonies on the western coast of Africa and those on the eastern
                    coast. According to an account that may be apocryphal, the British said, “Okay,
                    we'll give you a strip along the Zambezi River, which flows from west to east.”
                    They neglected to mention that Victoria Falls was in the middle, making riverine
                    transportation practically impossible. I don't know if that specific story is
                    true or not, but the Caprivi Strip was created to give the Germans a corridor,
                    and there is no African ethnic reason for its existence as a separate
                    entity.</p>
                <p>The rebellion itself was small-time stuff. A unit of insurgents established an
                    encampment and ended up killing some Namibians whom they had forcibly recruited.
                    The Namibian police and army got involved, martial law was declared, and 16
                    people were killed. A very promising tourism industry in the north was wiped
                    out. Tourism is very important to Namibia's future, but few tourists are willing
                    to expose themselves to armed conflict.</p>
                <p>Also around this time the Namibian government agreed to allow the Angolan army,
                    which has its bases on the coast in the west of the country, to use roads in
                    Namibia in order to attack UNITA bases in the central part of Angola. The road
                    system in Angola had basically been destroyed in decades of conflict. That
                    resulted in UNITA soldiers coming into Namibia to mine the roads. So, just about
                    the time that we were hoping to declare Namibia land mine-safe, new mines were
                    being laid. Fortunately, the number of new mines was rather small. Just as I was
                    leaving post, we pulled the Peace Corps out of the northern part of Namibia
                    because of the danger. Thus, Namibia's democratic and economic prospects began
                    to fade a bit, almost solely because of poor leadership and decision-making. One
                    of Nujoma's responses to his new difficulties was a half-hearted attempt to
                    stifle Namibia's free press. Unfortunately, I have heard more recently that he
                    is going after the press with more conviction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem with your American staff with this
                        AIDepidemic? I would think they would be very nervous.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>WARD: In going to post, I was convinced that would be a major issue. However,
                    that did not turn out to be the case, in part because the Namibians insisted
                    that their blood supply was safe. I can hardly believe that today, but they
                    convinced us then. Also, we established a “living blood bank” within the embassy
                    community. Barring a catastrophe, we could generate a large enough pool of blood
                    donors. Also, medical evacuation, which was necessary in more than one case
                    while I was there, was available quickly. There were good facilities in South
                    Africa. One embassy officer had a close call because of complications caused by
                    poor Namibian treatment of appendicitis. The poor treatment turned a rather
                    routine problem into one that required operations and more than three months of
                    hospitalization. Luckily, the officer survived. The standards of medical
                    treatment in Namibia looked better than they were. Health care was good by
                    African standards, but poor by U.S. ones.</p>
                <p>We had a large Peace Corps contingent. Many volunteers were teacher-trainers in
                    basic education. USAID and the Peace Corps had signed an agreement under which
                    USAID would finance a new curriculum for grades one through six in the Namibian
                    school system and the Peace Corps would field trainers to help Namibian teachers
                    use the curriculum. The contribution of each agency was necessary for the
                    project to work. By the time I arrived in Namibia, even though the agreement was
                    less than a year old, Peace Corps was already making noises about pulling out.
                    They decided the agreement did not fit in with the spirit of the Peace Corps
                    mission. USAID, which formulates its plans over the long term, had programmed a
                    significant amount of money for this effort and was quite chagrined. Relations
                    between the two chiefs of agency were all right on the personal level, but
                    terrible professionally. On my first trip back to the U.S., I went to see the
                    director of the Peace Corps to try to work problem out. The agreement I reached
                    worked for about 18 months. In my final year, Peace Corps simply pulled the plug
                    on their part of the program, making USAID's job more difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>WARD: The Peace Corps is an interesting organization. They made the decision for
                    their own reasons, which USAID and I did not agree with. Somehow, the Peace
                    Corps came to believe that working as trainers of teachers did not give their
                    volunteers the “full Peace Corps experience” of living in a village as part of a
                    family and interacting directly with people. I saw in the Peace Corps a
                    tremendous aversion to even appearing to be agents of the U.S. government. One
                    example: we had financed through our de-mining campaign a series of mine and
                    unexploded ordnance awareness posters meant for kids. The posters basically told
                    them in all the languages of the country: “If you see things that look like
                    this, don't pick them up.” Kids were getting wounded and killed every month
                    throughout northern Namibia by picking up grenades or mortar shells, which
                    exploded. We had a meeting on how to disseminate these posters throughout the
                    country. One suggestion was to give them to the many Peace Corps volunteers who
                    were teachers. They could give out the posters in their classes. I thought,
                    well, that's a good idea, and I took it to the Peace Corps director, who refused
                    to have anything to do with it. Absolutely. “That's politics,” he said. I said,
                    “It's not politics. It's humanitarianism. It's protecting kids.” They wouldn't
                    do it. Part of that may have been the personality involved. That was the kind of
                    thinking that drove their decision to pull out of the USAID program, and led
                    them to take other actions that detracted from our ability to represent American
                    interests. In my opinion, Peace Corps staff members often forget that although
                    Peace Corps Volunteers are not U.S. official representatives, staff personnel
                    are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1999. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: I left Namibia to take the job I have now at the United States Institute of
                    Peace. I had always thought that I'd like to do something after the Foreign
                    Service. My wife and I had decided that we wanted to live closer to our
                    daughter, son-in-law, and our grandchildren. We made the decision that Namibia
                    would be our final overseas post. I could have stayed in the service until at
                    least 2002, but thought that it might be easier to start a second career at age
                    54 than later. So, I was thinking about coming back to Washington in a position
                    that would allow me time for a job search. In the middle of that sort of
                    thinking, I got a letter from a headhunter. I had been getting similar letters
                    for years, saying basically, “We have this opening available. I wonder if you
                    know anyone who might be qualified for it.” In the past, I had always taken the
                    letters at face value. Sometimes I would write recommending a person. This
                    letter concerned an opening as director of the Professional Training Program at
                    the United States Institute for Peace. I read through the requirements. It
                    talked about training for peace operations and conflict prevention. Those were
                    all things that I was interested in and had some experience in. I thought that I
                    could do the job, and decided to recommend myself. I later discovered that such
                    letters are meant at least in part to gauge the recipient's interest in the
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I interviewed with Dick Solomon and others at the Institute of Peace. They had a
                    lot of applicants, and did not make up their mind until after I had returned to
                    Namibia from a chiefs of mission conference in January 1999. Then they said,
                    “We'd really like you to come on, but we're under tremendous pressure from
                    Congress to reinvigorate the program and expand it. We really can't wait until
                    you leave Namibia in July. We negotiated my arrival at the Institute in April,
                    and I left post in March. I left a little early, and I was quite grateful that
                    the African Bureau did not create any obstacles. I enjoyed working with
                    Assistant Secretary Susan Rice and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Johnny
                    Carson. By the time I left, I had done everything that I could in Namibia. It
                    was an interesting and satisfying tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what you're doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: The United States Institute for Peace is a non-partisan, congressionally
                    funded entity. It is not part of the government, and it does not represent U.S.
                    official policy. We work toward the peaceful settlement of violent or
                    potentially violent conflicts outside the United States. We do that through
                    various programs, including research, education, fellowships, and grants. We
                    also have a professional training program through which we try to help
                    practitioners acquire and improve skills in conflict prevention, management, and
                    resolution. That means teaching conflict analysis, communication, negotiation,
                    mediation, and other third party skills to audiences of government officials,
                    diplomats, military personnel, police assigned to international missions, civic
                    activists, NGO workers, and international organization officials. In the two and
                    one-half years that I have been at the Institute, we have grown the program to
                    the point that we reach about 1,500-2,000 people a year. We are moving into
                    computer-based, distance learning programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find the hand of Congress heavy or not on you as
                        ainstitute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARD: We are totally dependent on the Congress. Within the Executive Branch, our
                    budget is formulated as part of the Foreign Affairs Account, the 150 Account,
                    but our congressional authorizing and appropriating committees are the education
                    committees, not the foreign affairs ones. Sometimes we take a two-tracked
                    approach on funding, working with OMB, but also appealing directly to Congress.
                    Quite frankly, it's quite probable that if there just a few members of Congress
                    viscerally disliked the United States Institute of Peace, we would be on the
                    road to extinction. Therefore, congressional relations are very important to us.
                    A more present danger, however, is that of simply being overlooked. We are a
                    small institution, 65 employees plus fellows and a budget of about $15 million a
                    year. That kind of sum can become a rounding error in the budgets of the
                    education committees. We pay close attention to the views of Congress.</p>
