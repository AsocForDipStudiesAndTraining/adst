                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 26, 1999. This is an interview with
                        Michael Metrinko. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. First of
                        all, Metrinko sounds Ukrainian. What's the name from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Metrinko is Ukrainian. We are Lemko-Ukrainians, from the Carpathian
                    Mountains in southern Poland or, as it is today, southern Poland. At the time my
                    grandparents left, it was Galicia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. My grandfather got
                    his citizenship in America in 1896, so the family has been here since the early
                    1890s. It's more than a hundred years now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impulse - there's obvious impulse, but the
                        1890s was not -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In Galicia it was a major time for immigration. I've been back to the
                    original villages. I've talked to a lot of families who live there today in the
                    same villages, and I've done a great deal of study, both formally (some
                    post-graduate work in history of the times) and informally myself when I was in
                    Krakow, Poland; but the reasons were simple for departing from Galicia. It was
                    the poorest province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was a Western-looking
                    area; in other words, they looked to America and to other countries to find
                    work, and families had simply gotten too big for the amount of land they had.
                    Medicine had improved tremendously by the late 1800's in the Austro-Hungarian
                    Empire. The amount of land each village family owned had not increased; it had
                    gotten smaller and smaller, and so more and more people were leaving the
                    villages. In some cases hundreds and hundreds of people would leave a particular
                    town or village every year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they get out? Was there a problem? One looks at
                        the Jews in Russia at the time, or -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Russia was different.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course that included Poland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Parts of Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it often was a problem getting out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There was no problem from southern Poland. That was the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire. The rulers were “enlightened” (quote-unquote) and
                    people from there knew about jobs in America. I can give you two examples of
                    stories of traveling that I know of, on my mother's side. I talked to one of my
                    mother's aunts, her mother's sister, about how she physically came to America.
                    She was from a very small village in the Carpathian Mountains of southern
                    Poland. I went to the village perhaps 40 or 50 times. I know it well. When I
                    went there for the first time in 1983, the village still did not have any
                    asphalt or electricity. That came in the later 1980s. In 1983 it looked much as
                    it had looked 100 years before, which meant that it was impossible to drive
                    there. You had to stop the car short of the village and walk in because the
                    roads were filled with stones and boulders. You don't have to keep roads clear
                    if you are just using a horse to move about. The houses were made of a
                    combination of plaster and some wood, no stone, thatched roofs very often, and
                    absolutely remote from any places you could think of as the modern world. A
                    hundred years ago it was even worse because there weren't any place in the area
                    that had telephones or electricity or asphalt.</p>
                <p>I talked to my great-aunt about how she physically got to the United States, and
                    she said that somebody from the village had gone before her, sent a letter back
                    saying there was work in America, and mother's aunt corresponded with this
                    person, wrote a letter, got a letter back saying that her name had been
                    registered and she could pick up a ticket on the boat if she could get to
                    Bremen. She knew that it was a city in Germany. What she did was talk to her
                    parents about this, talk to the village priest about it. Several people started
                    at the same time. When she was ready to go, her father bought her her first pair
                    of real shoes (she was already a teenager), her father bought her a pair of
                    shoes, her mother helped her buy a coat, and the village priest wrote the word
                    America and pinned it to her coat with a pin, as a label, and she simply started
                    to walk. And it took her approximately a month, a little bit more, to walk from
                    her village to the port. And every time she arrived at a new village, people
                    would look at the label on the coat and say “America” and point off in the
                    direction she was supposed to go. This would sound strange today, but at the
                    time there were thousands and hundreds of thousands of people doing this in
                    Europe, especially in Eastern Europe (if you could get out of Eastern Europe) -
                    too many people in the family, small houses. They had a two-room house, one room
                    of which was used for the animals; they had eight or nine children. Now the
                    generation before the families had been smaller because children were expected
                    to die. In her generation none of the children died, so suddenly the land was
                    the same - that was going to go to one of the children - but the others had to
                    find something to do, and there wasn't any work in that part of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, when and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was born in 1946, November, in a hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
                    My home town was seven miles away. It was called Olyphant, Pennsylvania.
                    Olyphant was a small coal-mining town, anthracite coal-mining. And the house I
                    was born in was my grandfather's house. They'd been living in the same house
                    since 1904. The house had been built in approximately 1860. It was a huge
                    Victorian house that had been built as a hotel by the German Workmen's Group. My
                    grandfather bought it in 1904, turned it into a private residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Galicia I think of as being a mining area. Was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Not really. Galicia has oil, to some extent, the farther reaches of it.
                    In other parts they had salt mining, but some small amounts of coal mining,
                    charcoal, things like that, but not mining as such, not the way you'd think of
                    it today. The immigrants who came to the coal-mining areas came because that's
                    where the work was. The would have preferred, probably, to have been farmers,
                    but they either didn't know about farming or they didn't have the stake to start
                    a farm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your family, when you're talking about the ones who
                        came over, your grandfather and all, did they end up in Pennsylvania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They all came to Pennsylvania, partly by chance. My mother's mother
                    went to Connecticut first, met somebody who said the jobs were better in
                    Pennsylvania. She moved to Pennsylvania with two of her sisters. My mother's
                    father came a little bit later. He was the only one who came from Ukraine
                    proper, and he was escaping from military service; that's why he left there.
                    Ukraine proper, but even at the time it was still Bukovina and part of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire. My father's father, who was middle class, certainly
                    compared to my other grandparents (he could read and write several languages,
                    German, Russian, Polish, English, etc., probably Latin as well) but well
                    educated and, from the genealogy that we've worked out, from quite a decent
                    family. He came first to New York City and from New York City went to Alaska in
                    the 1880s, and came back from Alaska, by chance met his brother, who he did not
                    know was coming to the United States, in this small town - they were both
                    visiting the same relatives - and decided to stay there. He became a
                    businessman. He married a girl, my grandmother, who was from a village right
                    down the road from his in Poland, Galicia, but whom he had not known until he
                    got to the United States. She was several years younger. None of them, by the
                    way, ever worked in mines. For some reason, all my father's family became
                    businesspeople.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q: When you grew up, were your grandparents around?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: When I was born I still had two grandparents alive. My father's mother
                    lived in the house with us. She died when I was 16. And my mother's father lived
                    in a small town approximately two miles from where we lived. He lived in the
                    family house there, and we lived in the Metrinko family house in Olyphant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were part of a family that your
                        roots were elsewhere? In other words, the language and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: My parents in the house often spoke Ukrainian. They spoke it with my
                    grandmother because my grandmother spoke no English. She spoke Polish, Russian,
                    Ukrainian, but no English. She also spoke a little bit of Yiddish, from what my
                    parents tell me, because that was a lingua franca in that part of Galicia. When
                    I would talk to my grandmother, for example, and this went on till I was 16, and
                    I never thought about it until much later, I would speak to her in English and
                    she would reply in Ukrainian. I understood her replies; she understood my
                    English. Neither of us could speak the other's language, and I do not know how
                    that happened. I understand it's not unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's quite usual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: My grandfather who was still alive spoke quite decent English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the occupations of your mother and father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: My mother was a housewife. When she married my father, World War II had
                    just started. My father was a businessman, and my mother moved into the house
                    and simply started taking care of a huge house. By “huge,” I mean a house that
                    had, at the time, 50 or 60 rooms. It was a big house. She took care of that. We
                    had a housecleaner who also took care of a lot of it. We didn't live in the
                    whole thing. We had it subdivided, and lots of it was given up to apartments and
                    stores and everything else. I'll explain that. But she also took care of my
                    father's two brothers and his mother, and then she had three children. So she
                    did the housekeeping, cooking, cleaning, etc., nurturing for a husband, his two
                    brothers, who were both older than he was, who were not married, and his mother,
                    in addition to her own three children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you in the birth order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was the middle son, three sons.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your father, then, was in business, and obviously
                        he was a property owner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A property owner. My grandfather, when he bought the house in 1904,
                    bought what was then a hotel and a large house next door to it. He joined the
                    two together. In the house that was next door he made three apartments. The
                    jointure part became an apartment on the ground floor and a store on the main
                    floor. There was our house and, in fact, he attached another large building to
                    the main house. There was a ballroom, or a dance hall, with three apartments
                    underneath it. And also the hotel had a bar, of course. And so in the 1900s, my
                    grandfather, my uncles, and my father ran the grocery store, they ran the bar,
                    they ran the properties - there were six apartments in this complex - plus a
                    communal oven back of the house. And it was the last house before you got to the
                    railroad tracks, before you got to the opening of the coal mines. And across the
                    street from our house we had a series of approximately 3 or 4 layers of track,
                    with trains passing by every 15 minutes for the whole time I was growing up,
                    including a major water tank there for trains to stop at to get water. The old
                    steam locomotives need a lot of water. There was a culm dump, maybe a quarter
                    mile from the house, where all of the stuff being pulled out of the mines was
                    being emptied. This was larger than one of the Egyptian pyramids, and the little
                    lokies would run up and down this all day long from the mine openings taking the
                    trash that they weren't going to use from the mines, the dirt they had mined
                    out, and dumping it and making this pile, the culm dump, even bigger. At any
                    time there were hundreds of men, coal miners, working in the area, either on the
                    dump or in the sorting houses or in the sheds or in other areas there. And every
                    time there was a shift change and the men would change, they would all come down
                    and stop at either one of the two bars right there. Ours was one; across the
                    street was another bar. So the Poles, the Ukrainians, the Slovaks, anyone who
                    was of Eastern European origin would come to ours; the Irish and Italians would
                    go to the one across the street.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern about these slag heaps landsliding -
                        because in Wales they've lost villages that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: This one, no. I've never heard any expression of concern. There was no
                    sense of environmental concern, certainly, even though it was very typical of
                    these to catch fire and to burn forever. The one near our house never caught
                    fire (and now, by the way, it's gone and the area has been reforested and it's
                    almost beautiful), but at the time, all around my town there were coal mines and
                    culm dumps, which were sort of perpetually on fire, so the whole valley, that
                    whole area of northeast Pennsylvania, there was always a mist or a haze over it
                    from burning sulfur, sulfur smoke. And you could go two or three miles in any
                    direction and see burning dumps. They'd been burning for maybe 20, 30, 40 years
                    and could not be put out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before we get to school, but how would you
                        describe sort of the culture there? I mean you have miners, who are
                        obviously... this was not a job that many people wanted to do, and these
                        were people from certain areas, and this was the work of opportunity,
                        dangerous work and all that, and hard drinking and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Hard drinking, fighting, etc. - yes. It's a strange culture. The town
                    of Olyphant, when I was growing up, had approximately 7,000 people. There were
                    something like 10 or 12 exquisite churches there. The miners and their families
                    had poured all sorts of money into absolutely beautiful churches. If you had
                    been in Europe and seen any of these churches you would have immediately gone on
                    a tour of the inside they were that lovely - and still are that lovely. In fact,
                    now there's a church tour that concentrates on the town. At the same time, it
                    was a very multilingual town. The town consisted of Italians, Irish, Jews from
                    Eastern Europe, Ukrainians, Poles, Slovaks. The churches were Welsh Baptist,
                    Episcopalian, there was a Slovak Roman Catholic Church, there was a Polish Roman
                    Catholic Church, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic church, an Irish Roman Catholic
                    church. There were convents belonging to all the Catholic churches. There was a
                    synagogue right next door to the Russian Orthodox church, which was
                    catty-cornered to the Polish Roman Catholic church. And everybody lived mixed
                    up. There were no streets where every body was Irish, everybody was Jewish,
                    everybody was Italian. Houses were just totally mixed. You could have a Jewish
                    family living next door to a Polish family living next door to a Ukrainian
                    family - it made no difference. And basically, we all mingled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking, when you put a synagogue, a Polish
                        Catholic Church, a Russian Orthodox church - and these are, particularly on
                        the Polish and Russian side, not the most tolerant towards the Jews back in
                        those -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had no problems there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Jews doing in the town? I can't think of
                        them as being miners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were businesspeople. When I was growing up, the first original
                    generation of immigrants were all still there. My grandfather had died and my
                    grandmother had died, but my great-aunts were still alive. Other grandparents
                    were alive. Everyone else's grandparents were alive. And everyone that I knew
                    were people that had emigrated directly from some other country to the United
                    States, to this town. It was a town of a wide mixture of ages, from the very old
                    to babies. In fact, living right up the street from my house, about four or five
                    houses up, was a Civil War veteran, when I was growing up, and he was the
                    seventh or sixth last one in the United States at the time. But it was that sort
                    of town. I knew veterans of the Russo-Japanese War. I knew people who had been
                    to Fatimah to see the appearances there of the Virgin Mary. I mean, these were
                    all people living in the town. It was a strange place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your parents, because we are
                        talking about a period of time where often people have rather narrow views?
                        You know, they'd always talk about little Irish dressmakers or the micks
                        or... you know, that whole thing, but this doesn't seem very conducive to
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Let me give you some examples from the family. I came from a rather
                    strange family. My mother's family and my father's family are both large. On my
                    mother's side, only one of her sisters and brothers went to the university. That
                    was my aunt who became a nurse. With the exception of one aunt, the others all
                    married out. In other words, one married a Lutheran from Oklahoma City; one
                    married a Roman Catholic Pole from Connecticut, moved out to California to
                    live.</p>
                <p>On my father's side it was far more varied. My father's oldest sister went up to
                    New England to university back after the turn of the century, literally. Around
                    1910 or so, 1912, she went to school in Springfield, Massachusetts, ended up
                    marrying a Boston Brahmin. So I used to go up there and spend holidays. They had
                    a house there, an art collection and all this stuff, in Massachusetts. My
                    father's next sister married a state trooper from Newport News, Virginia, and
                    they both became public school teachers in Washington, DC. So my first memory of
                    a visit, of a trip, was in 1949, when I came to Washington and spent a summer
                    there and got to see President Truman walking down the mall on July 4th, when
                    the President would actually come and address the people. My oldest aunt's
                    husband was Protestant. My aunt basically became some sort of Protestant. My
                    next aunt's husband was, again, Protestant, raised the children kind of
                    Catholic, but only vaguely so. My father's oldest brother lived with us. He had
                    been married and divorced. His next brother never married, but they also both
                    went to university. One of my uncles went to New York University; the other one
                    went to St. Thomas' College in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The aunt who married the
                    state trooper also went to university up in Massachusetts. The next uncle down
                    went to school in Massachusetts after World War II and married an Episcopalian
                    from the far western part of Pennsylvania. Everybody married out. Everybody
                    scattered. My mother and father each married another Ukrainian and stayed in the
                    hometown area, but the others were mixed, you know, instead of sort of crowding
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When do you recall family life, sitting around the dinner
                        table, what did you talk about, or were books part of the discussion? Was
                        the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It's funny. I think we probably got more magazines and newspapers in
                    the house than the public library did. Right now I get something like 26
                    different magazines and newspapers and journals. Some come every day, some come
                    once a week, some come once a month. It's the same sort of group that I remember
                    my parents getting and my uncles getting in the house. One of my uncles was the
                    superintendent of schools for the whole area, one of the ones who lived with us.
                    The other uncle who lived with us read constantly - everything, history,
                    biographies, etc., etc., novels. My father read all the time. And it's funny,
                    but they never tried to stop me from reading even the adult books. My parents
                    were members of the Book-of-the-Month Club, for example, and from the time that
                    I first learned to read, first grade, I had access to any book in the house.
                    They never said a word about my picking up one of their adult novels. And
                    everyone had been to university, except my parents; everyone expected the
                    younger generation in the house to read and write as quickly as possible. I
                    still have some of my grandfather's collection of books from the 1800s and his
                    original desk, too. It's huge old floor-to-ceiling secretary desk, and it's
                    stuffed with books. I got that from the house in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, were there discussions in the house, of
                        politics, current events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: All the time. Politics - both my mother and father were... My father
                    was the Republican Party chairman of the town and had been for most of my
                    growing life. My mother was Republican Party committeewoman. Back in the first
                    Eisenhower election as president, I remember riding in the inaugural parade in
                    Pennsylvania because my father had one of the cars in the parade to wave to
                    people from. So politics was always there. My father had political positions in
                    the sense that when the Republicans were in charge in Pennsylvania he had a good
                    job and he worked and then went back to running the bar. And he was always the
                    chairman, so there was always talk about politics. In fact, the Republican votes
                    were basically counted in our house. When there was an election, all of the
                    chairpeople or the committee people would join in our house, and it was from our
                    dining room that results would be telephoned to the other bodies and
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I started out going to the Olyphant public school, where my uncle was
                    the superintendent - and then later he became superintendent of the whole
                    jointure, the whole area there - until seventh grade, when one of my friends
                    said that he was going down to take the examination for the local preparatory
                    school in Scranton. Since he was my best friend - everybody in seventh grade has
                    a best friend - I tagged along one Saturday, took the exam as well. I passed; he
                    didn't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't want to do it alone. It's called kismet. I passed and decided,
                    What the hell, I'll go to this school. It was a Jesuit school. I didn't know
                    what a Jesuit was, and until my first day of classes I did not know that priests
                    were the teachers there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family was Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, we are Greek Catholic, as opposed to Roman Catholic. We're under
                    the Pope, but there's a different hierarchy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your priest would be married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ah, that's raising a bad subject. Everywhere in the world except in the
                    United States, the priests of my church can marry. In the United States they
                    cannot because it caused such a great scandal for the Irish and Italian bishops.
                    Back in the 1800s they got the United States restricted for married clergy. I
                    was baptized by a married priest, but from then on they started to replace
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But through the seventh grade you were at a regular
                        school. How did you find the schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Elementary school?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Elementary school was good. I liked to study. I liked to read. I always
                    have. I mean, I was brought up in a house where everyone at the lunch table
                    would open up the newspaper. We didn't have conversation so much as people
                    reading magazines, newspapers, etc., all over the place. And if people went into
                    the bathroom they might be there for an hour or two, you know. We had more books
                    in our bathroom than most people have in their libraries.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>But the school was good. There was a problem with it. Whenever I did something
                    that was good, somebody would make the comment that it was only because of my
                    uncle being superintendent that I got the A's, that I got this award, that I got
                    that award. And yes, I did get awards, all through elementary and junior high
                    school, all sorts of things, from the Rotary Club, from this group, from that
                    group, you know - best picture for the post office art thing, etc. - and it was
                    really bothering me by junior high school that whenever I did something someone
                    was sure to say, Oh, it's only because of your uncle. I was desperate to get out
                    to show that I could do it myself. And I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the education there, coming from
                        such a mixed group? This would be during the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The '50s. The education from my grade school to high school? The
                    education in a town like Olyphant was always of a very good standard for one
                    reason. The teachers and the people of the town knew that the only way to get
                    out of the town and get a good job was to get an education. Everybody there had
                    some coal miner coughing his lungs out lurking in a back room of the house
                    because the person had not had an education and had had to go into the mines.
                    The mines were still open in the '50s. They didn't start closing until the late
                    '50s, early '60s. The alternative always was you either get an education, get a
                    university degree, or you're going to end up working in one of the local
                    factories on a factory line or you're going to end up working in the coal mines.
                    It's wonderfully salutary.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a small town. In a town of 7,000 people several of the teachers
                    had been my father's teachers. They still hearkened back to the time when a
                    teacher was not allowed to get married, sort of like the old days for women in
                    the Foreign Service. We had a large collection of spinster teachers who had
                    gotten quite old, knew our mothers, our fathers, our uncles, and our aunts and
                    were strict, by the line, you know. There were no discipline problems in the
                    school. There certainly was corporal punishment. I remember turning the page
                    once in first grade because I wanted to get to another page in the primer and
                    getting my knuckles rapped by a ruler very badly because I had been told to stay
                    on page one. This was old-line teaching. And I still remember all the teachers'
                    names, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to this Jesuit school. Was this equivalent to
                        a high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, it was the last four years of high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I finished there in 1964, so 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the school's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Scranton Preparatory School, or Scranton Prep. At the time it was an
                    all-boys' school. At the time it had, oh, altogether maybe 350 students in it,
                    in all four years. It was considered the best school in that whole part of
                    Pennsylvania. It was certainly the most rigorous - excellent discipline,
                    excellent curriculum, and everybody from the school went to university. I mean,
                    there were no ifs, ands, or buts about it. If you went there and got through,
                    you were going to get accepted into a university. This was back, of course, in
                    the days when not everyone got accepted into university, when there was a real
                    cut-off. A lot of students don't realize that today, that you could not just
                    sign up at a school the way you can today. You know, you simply had to get
                    through all the examinations, and if you didn't get accepted, you didn't get
                    accepted then. If you went to this school, you got accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned reading a lot. Did you read the stories of
                        John O'Hara at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: All the Pennsylvania stories? Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they sort of -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>METRINKO: That was the society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, that was sort of upper - class, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, John O'Hara was not upper-class. He was more solid middle,
                    slightly upper-middle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used to say that he wrote his stories because he
                        wasn't really admitted into Yale or something, or the upper Eastern
                        establishment used to feel that he hadn't been accepted so he wrote his
                        stories with a certain amount of bitterness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He wrote stories about people who were part of the country club set,
                    people who had cottages on the local lake, people who were doctors and lawyers
                    and used car dealers or new car dealers and who went to Europe on vacations once
                    in a while. That kind of describes a lot of the people I knew and some member,
                    but not all, by any means, of my own family, because my own family went all the
                    way up from one uncle who was an uneducated never-finished-high-school janitor
                    all the way up to an uncle who got his doctorate at Harvard and taught at a
                    university in New England. So it was all the way back and forth. Probably one of
                    the most interesting things about growing up is that I could go from one end of
                    the spectrum to the other and deal with people from the Harvard set at my
                    uncle's and aunt's house in Massachusetts and then come back and sit at my other
                    uncle's table and have a drink with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Jesuit education during the
                        '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Penal servitude?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work, and then what were you interested
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They didn't give you a chance to be interested in something. You were
                    told what you were going to be interested in and what you weren't going to be
                    interested in. The education system was the old classic education system. Number
                    one, the schools were all boys. Number two, coat and tie required, so I had to
                    learn very quickly how to tie a tie. You had to have your hair cut short. If you
                    were seen smoking, it was automatic dismissal from the school unless you were a
                    senior. If you were seen drinking, automatic dismissal. If it was reported that
                    you were drinking, automatic dismissal from the school. The school was run on
                    very traditional conservative lines. We had Latin two hours a day every day of
                    the year my freshman year. A strong emphasis on the humanities, history,
                    English, Latin, math, science - very straight, no frills curriculum. There were
                    extra-curricular activities, but very, very limited. You weren't there to have
                    fun; you were there to study. And the curriculum was designed in a way that
                    every student had a minimum of three hours of homework a night. The teachers,
                    during their meeting sessions, would decide what the homework assignments were
                    going to be so that they knew you were studying three hours a night or so in
                    order to prepare yourself for the next day. If you did not do the studying one
                    night, it showed very quickly the next day. And this was true for all four
                    years.</p>
                <p>We had a prefect of discipline who was busy, and discipline was extremely good in
                    this school. There was no mouthing off, no fighting, nothing like that. It was
                    run on very, very strict Jesuit lines. What can I say. It was, I thought, and
                    excellent education, now that I look back on it, absolutely excellent. The
                    discipline was there, the curriculum was there. I liked the classics so much
                    that in my second year, when we were given a choice of either taking the Greek
                    course or the Science course (this meant that you were going to spend the next
                    three years, one hour a day, either taking science, biology, chemistry, physics,
                    etc., or taking Greek in addition to your Latin), I wanted the Greek. My father
                    took one look at it and said, “No, you're going to study science.” Thank
                    goodness, because everyone who went into the Greek studies program had a little
                    bit more difficulty getting into university later - not difficulty, but a little
                    bit more. They had to take make-up science courses because practically every
                    university required some basics in science.</p>
                <p>I did very well in school. I took lots of gold medals. I was probably, in the
                    graduating class, either three or four - I've really forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you living in Scranton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I lived in Olyphant, and I would either hitchhike or take the bus
                    every day. It was half an hour's drive to the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there '60-64. For a Republican family, John
                        Kennedy was the first Catholic to run successfully for President, and also
                        there was an aura about him. Did that penetrate down at your level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, sure. When Kennedy and Nixon were having their campaign, I was
                    head of the debating team there that was pro-Nixon. We had to have a sort of
                    presidential campaign debate. And the amazing thing about it was that the
                    school, which was heavily Irish and Italian, by the way (there were two
                    Ukrainian Greek Catholics in my class, for example - I was one of them) - there
                    were two Protestants, no Jews at that point - everyone else was either Irish or
                    Italian or some version of that - but in a class where everybody was
                    pro-Kennedy, I managed to get the votes so that it was 50-50, which I thought
                    was amazing. Kennedy was assassinated when I was a senior, 1963 - yes, I was a
                    senior - then I started in '59. I'm sorry, I'd forgotten the year I started.
                    When the news came over we were all summoned to the main assembly room of the
                    school, and the headmaster told us the news and asked everyone to pray, and
                    immediately the entire school, with the exception of two people, got on its
                    knees. I remained standing, and my best friend, who was a Protestant in the
                    class, remained standing too. I did not like the Kennedys then or now.</p>
                <p>Q: One thing this Kennedy thing did, it made much more awareness towards public
                    service and all that.</p>
                <p>Were you getting much of this? Was public service something thrown at you as an
                    option, or were the professions more than service?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, not particularly. The professions, certainly. That was going to be
                    left to university. The standing rule - it even talks about this... In fact, we
                    had a mini-reunion here in Washington three or four months ago, several people
                    who had been to the same high school, one or two from my year, one or two from
                    the year after and the year after that, and we talked about the school because
                    we'd all had the same teachers, the same headmaster, and the same prefect of
                    discipline. We had not known, graduating school that we were allowed to actually
                    apply to schools that were non-Jesuit for university. It was that restricted.
                    When they talked about potential future careers, it was to be a teacher, to be a
                    doctor, to be a lawyer, so public service in that sense, but not aimed really at
                    government work. This was a small town, remote from Washington. I knew about
                    Washington because I had family here, and I'd come here on vacations; but most
                    of my classmates had not been to the City of Washington. I don't think anybody
                    would look forward in high school to a career in government. It's not something
                    you start thinking about in ninth grade or tenth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>METRINKO: From my high school, no, not at all; from my junior high school, yes.
                    It was very common for guys from my junior high school, when they finished high
                    school, to go into the military. My uncle, one of the ones who lived at home
                    with us, served on the local draft board. We knew all about the military. It was
                    part of our lives. I think I grew up in World War II, even though I was born
                    right after it was over because that was what people talked about. But going
                    into the military from my prep school - no, not at all, never even a whisper of
                    that. No one did it. They became doctors, lawyers, whatever, teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you graduated, what, '63, '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I graduated '64 from high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pointed towards anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: When I started looking at possible universities in 1963, again, we were
                    almost force-fed into the Jesuit educational system for university. So I looked
                    at three Jesuit schools, Fordham, Georgetown, and the University of Scranton. I
                    applied. I was given full scholarship offers from Georgetown and from Fordham.
                    My father had told me when we talked about do we have the money for me to go to
                    university, what he had said was, “If you go to the University of Scranton, you
                    could live at home, and I'll pay your tuition; if you go anywhere else, you'll
                    have to pay for it yourself.” So I immediately knocked off the University of
                    Scranton from my thinking, swore I would never go there, and luckily I got these
                    scholarship offers, so by loaning money and the full scholarship, I went to
                    Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Georgetown from '64 to '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Georgetown when you first
                        arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>METRINKO: To begin with, I had already had two cousins who had gone through
                    Georgetown, with my family name, and in that decade, 10 or 15 years, I
                    eventually had three cousins with my family name, my younger brother, and two
                    cousins on my mother's side who went there too. So we had a whole slew who went
                    to Georgetown. When I first got there - what can I say? - I liked it. I knew
                    people there. There were three of us from my high school who were coming here,
                    to start out with. I had worked for the summer at a summer camp up in the
                    Poconos as a dishwasher, and one of the other guys on the staff, who was from
                    New York City - today I can't even remember his name, but we were good friends
                    the first part of freshman year, the way things are - I liked it. I felt very
                    much at home at Georgetown. I mean, I had an uncle living here in the city,
                    cousins in the city, another cousin who was a senior when I was there who
                    immediately took charge of me and invited me over, introduced me to people and
                    talked to me, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that often happens is that when a kid
                        comes out of a strict school and all of a sudden hits a university, they go
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - ape?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - ape. How about you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, lots of them did, because there was drinking here, and most of the
                    states had far stricter drinking regulations than Washington. At the time here
                    in Washington, you could drink at the age of 18. When I got here I was already
                    of drinking age, but I had been accustomed to being around alcohol my whole
                    life. My parents certainly trained me how to drink. They used to give us claret
                    or burgundy or something like that on holidays, and a sip or beer or some wine
                    was not uncommon at all at our house. So the alcohol didn't mean anything to me.
                    It wasn't a challenge, like something new and forbidden; I'd had it. Drugs did
                    not start until I was probably in my junior or sophomore year; they became more
                    prevalent. I tried different stuff then, but it didn't mean so much to me
                    either. The interesting part was girls. I had gone to an all-boys school. That
                    was very, very pleasant. We basically had a good, pleasant time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Georgetown men find girls, because it was not
                        coed in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, Georgetown was. The only school that was not coed was the college.
                    At the time the Foreign Service School was coed. Two of my female cousins had
                    gone to the Foreign Service School, and one of them was still there, as a
                    senior. Georgetown was coed - the nursing school, the School of Linguistics, the
                    Foreign Service School; and also we had Trinity, Dumbarton, Marymount, and
                    Visitation, all within easy commuting distance, all of them at Georgetown all
                    the time for mixers. Georgetown, the city of or the town of, the bars were
                    filled with girls from other states and other areas coming in for the weekends.
                    There was no problem at all and very, very pleasant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What studies did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I went into the School of Foreign Service - not because I wanted to be
                    a Foreign Service officer. I didn't know what a Foreign Service officer was. I
                    started out at the Institute of Languages and Linguistics and then transferred
                    to the School of Foreign Service. But the reason that I took the Institute was
                    that it was the only school I looked at that did not require you to take science
                    or math, and I would have gone far to find a school like that. I didn't know
                    about economics at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, he was. He was still there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Good gosh, I can remember my teachers back in grade school sometimes
                    better. Well, there was Charles Carroll - no, not Charles Carroll - Carroll
                    Quigley.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Carroll Quigley was there with his infamous, very good, eye-opening
                    course on development of civilization. I had that my freshman year. Good gosh,
                    Father Zriny for economics, the first economics teacher I had and one in a whole
                    string of non-American and non-native English speakers. For years and years and
                    years I assumed that you had to be a foreigner with a heavy accent to teach
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the students in your class, not
                        the ones farther along which came into the School of Foreign Service? Did
                        they know what they were doing, or was this just a place that didn't require
                        physics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, we had a lot of students who were very focused. One of the very
                    first students I met there - in fact, I had just moved into my dormitory room
                    and had met my new roommate, and there was a knock on the door, and we opened
                    the door and there was a very tall guy there from Arkansas who said, “Hi, my
                    name is Bill Clinton, and I'm running for president of the freshman class, and
                    I'd appreciate your vote.” And so he was one of the first people I met at
                    school. He was in my class. I'll give you a few examples of others. Lucy Johnson
                    was at Georgetown at that point. We had the daughter of one of the African
                    kings, whose name I do not remember, and I dated once or twice a very pleasant
                    girl from the Philippines, and one day I asked her - we were talking about
                    family - I asked her what her father did for a living, and she said, “Oh, my
                    father's in the government.” And I said, “Oh, mine is too,” thinking of my
                    father, who then had a job in the tax department of Lackawanna County in
                    Pennsylvania. And I said, “What kind of government work does he do?” And she
                    said, “He's the president of the Philippines.” This sort of thing. There were
                    lots of very focused, very intelligent, very well-traveled people - not by any
                    means all. There were lots just like me, from small towns, from Jersey City,
                    from Newark, from New York City, from the Bronx, from New Jersey, who were there
                    because they had been very good and sharp in high school and had gotten into
                    Georgetown, the Foreign Service School of the College, and they were starting to
                    go up - Bill Clinton, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you, as you were doing this, begin to find,
                        figure out what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I did and I didn't. A lot of what we do in life is chance. What I
                    desperately wanted to do when I finished college was to go into the Peace Corps.
                    I had wanted to do this since I first started to read about it in the early
                    '60s. And five or six years, seven years later I still really wanted to do it. I
                    had a girlfriend at the time, in junior year, who wanted to go into the Peace
                    Corps too. She wanted to go to Turkey because she had once visited there with
                    her father. Her father was an Army attach� at one of the embassies. She had
                    spent a couple of years living overseas. Because she wanted Turkey, I put down
                    Turkey too. I got accepted to Turkey in my senior year; she was rejected by the
                    Peace Corps. (Shows the kind of people I hung around with). But I ended up going
                    to Turkey in the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had government service begun to become a possibility as
                        you were at Georgetown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In college I didn't think about it that much. We were focused on other
                    things. These were the years of the Vietnam buildup. I had a lottery number, and
                    my lottery number was very low. I was going to go off and get drafted if I did
                    not go into the Peace Corps. I would say my going in was a combination of the
                    two things. I wanted to go in and had wanted to go in since before I'd ever
                    heard of Vietnam, and at the same time, it was a way to avoid going into the
                    Army and also doing it legally and sort of not in a bad way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Vietnam raising its head while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes. I'm trying to think if I was a junior or a senior. I've
                    forgotten now. But every last one of my friends and I got ourselves a lottery
                    number. That was the year of the big lottery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With that, were there protests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Not yet. It didn't start until afterwards. Georgetown, up until 1968,
                    was what they used to call a “hotbed of apathy.” That was the expression used
                    for it. Nobody was protesting yet. That all started a year or two years later.
                    When I was at Georgetown you still had to wear a coat and tie to class every
                    day. You had to be in class before the teacher, or you did not get into class.
                    It was still a fairly well disciplined school. The first year that I started,
                    you had to be in your dormitory by a quarter of eight in the evening. There was
                    a lights-out policy too. The concept of having a member of the opposite sex in
                    the dormitory was just... nobody... it was inconceivable. There was one day a
                    year when we had Visitors' Day, when if you had your door wide open and sort of
                    stuck wide open, you could have a female actually come into the room, put her
                    feet on the floor of your bedroom. But other than that, that was the only day of
                    the year. But by the same token, we had maid service too, which was kind of
                    nice, freshman year. That started to disappear. Maid service disappeared.
                    Curfews also disappeared when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about studies? What sort of subjects were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Competitive, rigorous. Again, for me, solid language, history,
                    economics, some linguistics, a lot of government courses.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the school lend itself to sort of focusing on one area of the world or
                    not?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I took courses diverse as History of Russia, the History of India,
                    several European courses, standard Western European courses. Economics covered
                    the whole gamut of the world. Comparative government also covered a number of
                    systems. I took French as my language, but you could have taken Chinese or
                    Russian or German or whatever. You got into those areas, those regions, to
                    study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any opening to the government out there - you
                        know, visiting people coming in from Congress or from other countries - that
                        sort of thing, because you were in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, Georgetown is a unique school in that sense. One of the best
                    things about it is that every government leader who came through would come
                    there to talk. They had a very, very active program, and I thought a wide
                    variety of people coming in from other countries. For example, King Hussein came
                    to give a major speech. But people would come in all the time like that, and the
                    student body was a very diverse one. We had the sons and daughters of a lot of
                    diplomats there. For example, one of my classmates, Turki Faisal, the son of the
                    king of Saudi Arabia, was there. His roommate later became a good friend of
                    mine. He was the son of the Turkish ambassador to the United States at the time.
                    One of my closest friends freshman year was a guy from Thailand. And I used to
                    date a girl from Thailand. Another girl that I dated was from Rumania, the
                    daughter of a diplomat. So there was a diverse foreign body there. Teachers were
                    very often from foreign countries. The Jesuits are an international body. It's a
                    very strange group of clergy. They come from all around the world, and they
                    would come from all around the world to be assigned to Georgetown University
                    too, and then go off again to other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure exactly when John XXIII came in. When did
                        that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That happened just before that. We certainly had the effects of that,
                    both in my high school and at Georgetown. A lot of the old church furniture, the
                    altars, etc., had disappeared. Priests changed the way they did mass. It was
                    becoming - you know, you had more of the blues masses and the jazz masses and
                    other things. I can think of all sorts of folk masses that didn't make them
                    necessarily more familiar to us because if you were middle-class American a jazz
                    mass or a folk mass or a blues mass had nothing at all to do with your own
                    background, but it was an attempt to try to meld different things together. They
                    were then starting to go away from Latin and into the vernacular. All that was
                    happening at that time.</p>
                <p>We also saw the demise of the education system in the United States and parochial
                    schools too, the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling during this period the desegregation, the
                        effort to reach out to the black community, essentially?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, Georgetown was involved in it. I was in a group called the GUCAP,
                    the Georgetown University Community Action Program. I was a tutor for some black
                    kids in the city. There was that. Very few black students came to the campus
                    unless they happened to be the children of black diplomats or very, very
                    well-off blacks from African countries or from somewhere else. The number of
                    black students was very limited at Georgetown, but... I'm just trying to think.
                    The basketball team - I doubt there were any blacks on the team at the time -
                    that sort of thing. Attempts to reach out. I guess people thought it was
                    politically correct, and there was certainly a lot more community action going
                    on than had gone on in previous years, but it was also a time - 1968 - when
                    Martin Luther King was killed and Washington caught fire. Then there was a
                    reversal, a real sort of becoming an island again, a lot of fear too. The city
                    was closed down for a week or two.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I wanted to leave the United States. I wanted to see what life was
                    like out of it. I'd had so many friends who were from other countries. I knew
                    that my own family background was not in the United States, that we had come
                    from other places. I just wanted to get out. I had been reading books since I
                    was a child, since I was a baby almost. I would routinely go through more than
                    100 books a year, and I was desperate to leave lower middle-class Olyphant,
                    Pennsylvania, and go off and see the world - and not in an Army uniform - just
                    to go off and see the world. And the Peace Corps fit the bill. I couldn't do a
                    grand tour, but I could sure go off and live somewhere interesting.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Indoctrination training was actually rather funny. I was told to report
                    to Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California. Eagle Rock has a very good small school
                    called Occidental College.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of between Pasadena and Beverly Hills and that
                        area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Right. It's a very, very beautiful little school, a little gem of
                    school out there, and they had a contract for running the Peace Corps training
                    for the summers. So I went off to Eagle Rock and showed up in Los Angeles for
                    what was supposed to be two months of Turkish training. I had a great time. I
                    immediately liked the Turkish teachers. I had another cousin who had also been
                    through Georgetown, living in Los Angeles at the time, who was delighted that I
                    was out there and used to show up and pick me up in her convertible and whisk me
                    away from classes at the school and off to things on weekends. The summer school
                    was in session, and it consisted mostly of girls who were living in the sorority
                    houses there. I had a great time with them. I spent a lot of my time fooling
                    around during training, going out to the beaches, touring around, spending time
                    with my cousin. I had a private dinner one day with Tiny Tim. My cousin
                    introduced us. You know, this sort of thing. It was great fun. I went off to
                    Palm Springs. I got to Las Vegas. All the sorts of things that you do in about
                    10 weeks of frenetic activity. I disappeared one day with one of the Turkish
                    teachers, who suggested that we cut class. He was a Turkish university student
                    there who was teaching us Turkish, and he wanted to go off and do something, so
                    I went off with him and spent the whole day with Turks, came back and discovered
                    that we had had a surprise inspection from Washington, and I was being summoned
                    - they had left notes all over for me - because they were worried about my
                    ability to adjust to foreign countries, and the people from Washington had
                    wanted to talk to me. I was not a group player. The Peace Corps head of our
                    program at Eagle Rock was a professional psychologist. He used to sit around
                    with a notepad taking notes all the time as we talked our interacted or did
                    things. And he had realized he rarely saw me in groups. I was always off doing
                    something, so he had decided I was not going to make it in Turkey. Well, they
                    literally told me that I should drop out of the program in Eagle Rock because
                    obviously I was not cut out for the Peace Corps, and I reminded them that they
                    had said that everybody in training in Eagle Rock would go to Turkey, and the
                    final cut would not be made until after our month in Turkey. They had said this;
                    they could not tell me to leave if they were telling the truth then. And they
                    got annoyed, but they said it would depend on my Turkish examination. And I went
                    into the Turkish examination, and the teacher, the examiner, was from FSI. He
                    had come out from Washington. And one of the first questions he asked me, in
                    Turkish, was my name and where I had gone to university. And I told him, and he
                    immediately said, “Oh, Georgetown” - in English - that he also had had some
                    affiliation with Georgetown, and the next thing I knew we knew all sorts of
                    people in common, because I knew people at FSI, courtesy of their children whom
                    I had gone to school with, and he spent the next 20 minutes laughing and talking
                    in English about Washington, DC, and this place and all the people we knew in
                    common, etc., etc., etc. He forgot, literally, he was giving me a Turkish
                    examination. And when they announced the scores, I came out as the highest score
                    of the entire group, which nobody could understand. And he was gone. But he had
                    conducted the whole examination in English. It was great, you know.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Anyway, I went off to Turkey and arrived in Turkey and got off the plane and
                    immediately loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from, what, '68 to '70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: '68 to '70 - but got off the plane, saw people standing at the awful
                    Dogpatch airport - the airport in Ankara back in 1968 was like something left
                    over from World War I. A dust storm was blowing, and there were women standing
                    there veiled. And I though, This is where I want to be. And by the next day I
                    had made Turkish friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you sent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, they were so sure I was not going to make it in Turkey that they
                    assigned me as a problem case to Ankara, and I spent two years teaching at
                    Hacettepe University, which was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Ankara like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ankara in those days, 1968 to '70, still had wide boulevards. Attat�rk
                    Boulevard, which is the street the embassy is on, was lined with big old houses
                    and with buildings set half a block in from the sidewalks, with huge gardens
                    with trees in front of them. Restaurants typically had huge, huge gardens. It
                    was a city of gardens, pleasant villas, small apartment buildings, only one
                    hotel that you would even think of as being a decent hotel. There was one
                    traffic light in the entire city. As we used to say, “Let's meet at the light,”
                    and everyone knew what it was. And that was way, way, way down away from us. The
                    university that I was teaching at was a great place. The students were all my
                    age. I made lots of friends there, had a good time for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the state of Turkish education when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I thought the university was quite good. It was highly selective, of
                    course. You don't get into a university easily in Turkey. You had to pass very
                    rigorous exams. They took a small percentage of the graduating class of every
                    high school. My students tended to be bright, spoke or learned to speak quite
                    good English, well educated, well brought up, nice people. I had Turkish
                    roommates who were well educated or in the process of becoming well educated,
                    bright decent people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How dedicated did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The students were hard-working. To stay on in the universities they had
                    to work, and they did. It was not a free ride. At the same time, the
                    universities were rife with problems, basically political problems. This was
                    when socialism was rearing its head. There was lots of anti-American stuff going
                    on because of Vietnam. Political troubles in Turkey itself - the problems were
                    having a resurgence then, so there were also political problems there in the
                    universities at the time. The universities went off on strike several times when
                    I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the university end up, as so many universities
                        around the world do, except in the United States and maybe England, with the
                        students being practically expected to be quite radicalized and demonstrate
                        practically extreme socialist, Communist or stuff? Then when they graduate
                        they go out into the world and they do a complete turnaround.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, that's fairly descriptive of Turkish universities except for the
                    Kurdish ethnic problem. But at the time it was less Kurdish and more socialist
                    versus far right. The solcu and the saci, the right and left. And there were
                    students with beards and students without beards. If you had a beard, you were a
                    socialist hippie. Everybody had a moustache, but you either had a beard or you
                    did not have a beard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Islam at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In the universities, almost no mention of it. The university that I was
                    at, one of my classrooms where I taught probably five days a week in the
                    afternoon, that particular classroom had been built... it was a brand new
                    university. In fact it was still under construction. And our particular building
                    had been built right next to the minaret of a mosque, a very old minaret of what
                    was then still a village mosque, because we were on one of the outskirts of the
                    city. The muezzin, the guy who did the call to prayer, would climb the minaret
                    and do the call to prayer in person. I could see him standing about 70 or 80
                    feet from me, and the top of the minaret was on a level with my classroom, so we
                    had a beautiful view of him. I would always stop the class when he was doing the
                    call to prayer, and the students would laugh at me for even paying attention to
                    it. He had a beautiful voice. But the students themselves, not religious, at
                    least not on the surface religious at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women students with head scarves?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No scarves at all in the universities then or now. Scarves weren't
                    allowed, and this was the time of the miniskirt, so a typical Turkish girl, if
                    she were middle class there, would be wearing a miniskirt and high boots, and
                    long, long hair, you know, sort of flowing freely. It was a wonderful time to be
                    in Turkey. The girl students were absolutely beautiful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your university sort of rank in the pecking
                        order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a new university, a medical university attached to Hacettepe
                    hospital in Ankara. It was very, very new. The first building was still under
                    construction, the first several buildings. It was surrounded by mud fields and
                    construction fields. It was part of the hospital complex. When you were sitting
                    in the school cafeteria, for several months of one year, the operating theater
                    was on the other side of the cafeteria, and the connection was through the
                    cafeteria. So bodies were being wheeled through the cafeteria on stretchers to
                    have operations and medical treatment. It was that new. They still hadn't gotten
                    the complex put together. The pecking order wasn't applicable yet. If you
                    wanted, the old established university in Ankara was Ankara University, which
                    had a law faculty and the political science faculties attached to it. The other
                    one in Ankara was the Middle East Technical University, METU, which taught all
                    courses in English - engineering, hard sciences. Ours was social work, pre-med,
                    things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your language training was going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I think as with all language training, you learned the theory of it in
                    FSI, although I never had any FSI training in Turkish. You learn the theory of
                    it in language class and you learn the practicality of it when you meet friends
                    and start going out. And that's how I learned Turkish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how about your teaching English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, that was fine. The students were interested. They knew they had to
                    study it. They knew that to get ahead in Turkey you had to have English at that
                    point. They were serious about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the view of America, because we are talking
                        about the Vietnam time and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The view of America versus the view of Americans. Students were
                    basically anti-America. Our government was doing some awful things. They were
                    seeing it all in the news in Turkey, so they were becoming more and more
                    anti-American government, anti-American Army. We had a lot of military bases in
                    Turkey at the time, US military bases, including one in Ankara. These became the
                    focus of attention, too. Towards myself, never anything personal. My friends
                    were Turkish, and some of the most radical in my class were friends of mine.
                    We'd go out drinking together. We would argue about Vietnam, but I wasn't a
                    supporter of Vietnam either. In fact, the years that I was there, a lot of Peace
                    Corps - not me, but a lot of them - took part in an anti-Vietnam demonstration
                    in Turkey, caused a lot of trouble, actually for the Peace Corps there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the writ of the Peace Corps work with you while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Peace Corps is a funny organization. It didn't at the time exert
                    any real discipline over us, so that I would go to the Peace Corps office
                    occasionally to get mail, to look at other things, but not really hang around at
                    all - there was no reason to. I knew people on the staff, of course. I knew
                    other people who would drop in to get a newspaper or to pick something up or
                    drop something off, but we didn't really have a close, close connection to it.
                    It was there; my apartment was half a mile away from it. I would usually have
                    breakfast at a place that was only a block or so away from it, but by no means
                    did I go in on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were they monitoring you, or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In theory I guess they were, but I don't really remember anyone from
                    the Peace Corps office coming down to the university. And there were seven or
                    eight of us assigned to the university. They had yearly Peace Corps assemblies
                    when we would all go off to a hotel somewhere off in the outskirts or one of the
                    provinces and get together and talk about the Peace Corps, talk about what we
                    were doing. They did that twice when I was there and were sorry for having done
                    it each time. The first year when I was there we took a vote, and the vote came
                    out almost unanimous from the volunteers that the Peace Corps should not be in
                    Turkey, that Turkey did not need Peace Corps. And the Peace Corps staff got very
                    upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really designed for a different country, anyway.
                        What did you and your group feel was the rationale for keeping the Peace
                        Corps there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Political reasons. Part of the Turkish government wanted to look as if
                    they were very receptive to the United States. And I don't think that the Peace
                    Corps at the time ever looked at pulling out of places; they just wanted to get
                    into more places. There was an unlimited supply of volunteers; there was lots of
                    money in the budget - Kennedy and Johnson both supported it - and it was, you
                    know, it was a good idea, it seemed, at the time.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Very limited contact. I knew one of the Marine guards at the embassy
                    because he was dating one of the girls in my Peace Corps group. Other than that,
                    I think I may have been to the embassy cafeteria occasionally, and that was it.
                    We could also cash checks, if I remember correctly, in the embassy Budget and
                    Fiscal Office, and it was a way to get American dollars if we were going on a
                    vacation or a trip somewhere, because they were not easy to get if you got a
                    check and you wanted to cash it. You would go to a Turkish bank and wait
                    forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was student life like there while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Guys and girls studied together at the university. Because it was a
                    university in the capital city, and I guess considered one of the up-and-coming
                    universities once it got off the ground, we had a fairly middle-class group of
                    students there, middle-class and slightly upper-class. Life was easy. I mean I
                    would go out on weekends all the time with the students - with the guys,
                    basically - to go drinking for a night - not every weekend, but it happened a
                    lot. There was some traveling. I'd go off on trips sometimes with students,
                    things of that sort. It was rather free and easy in class. This was 1968. I was
                    22, so I was almost the same age as a lot of my students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Kurdish problem? Did that intrude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It didn't exist. Officially there were no Kurds in Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were “Mountain Turks”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Mountain Turks. I had Kurdish friends. Two of us - myself as one
                    volunteer with a Turkish roommate and the people who lived in the next apartment
                    building over, two volunteers from a different group, had both taken in Turkish
                    high school students who wanted to come to the capital city to complete their
                    high school education. It was quite often done in Turkey if you were from a
                    provincial town. The parents would send their son to the capital city to get
                    into what they thought was a better high school to improve his chances of
                    getting into a college. I had one of the students living with me, and in the
                    next apartment over was one of his closest friends. And the next apartment with
                    the other Peace Corps Volunteers was the next building over. It was maybe 100
                    meters from our place. They had a Kurdish high school student, and my student
                    and that student were very close friends. They were always together. So I got to
                    know the Kurdish student very well, went back to his village with him a couple
                    of times, in Eastern Turkey. I also had some Kurdish students of my own. The
                    were very circumspect, very guarded, but could be very vocal in private, when
                    you got them out of the Turkish environment. And I certainly saw some good
                    examples of what was happening to the Kurds when I went out with these
                    students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, if you village had a Kurdish name, the name had been changed to a
                    Turkish name and you had to use the Turkish name. You could not give y our
                    children Kurdish first names; they had to be given Turkish first names. You
                    weren't allowed to register with Kurdish names. You were not allowed to speak
                    Kurdish in public. It was considered an illegal language on the streets;
                    therefore, they weren't going to teach anyone Kurdish. They could speak it
                    inside their own homes, with their families.</p>
                <p>You'd hear quite a bit about Kurds - the Kurds this and the Kurds that. Of course
                    their existence was being denied in the public press and regular history books.
                    As far as I know the US Government went along with this lock, stock, and barrel
                    - which it does today too, for that matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there radical leftist Marxist-Leninist organizations
                        in the university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In the Peace Corps?Sorry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking about the university and -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>METRINKO: If there were, and there were, members would never have introduced
                    themselves to me as a member of a Marxist-Leninist, whatever, group. Did the
                    guys I went out drinking with have tendencies in that direction? Yes, probably.
                    We had a lot of discussions about politics. A lot of them were not happy. My
                    students also went off on strike routinely, especially in 1970. There were a
                    series of strikes, against the university, against the government. But as to
                    their particular affiliation with this or that group, I can't answer. They would
                    never have talked to me about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what were you thinking about? You had a
                        two-year term. What were you thinking about doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What I wanted to do was to spend a third year in Turkey. I had put off
                    making a decision. I wanted to spend a third year there. My uncle was on the
                    draft board in Pennsylvania, and I talked to him about what would happen if I
                    came back to the United States. I wanted to go into graduate school, study
                    Middle Eastern studies, get a master's degree; and it was something I had never
                    thought about before going to Turkey, of course. I just fell in love with the
                    area, the language, the people, everything else. I talked to my uncle, and he
                    said that as long as I stayed in the Peace Corps I would be considered
                    draft-exempt by our draft board because they were exempting all teachers and
                    Peace Corps volunteers. I came from an area that was oversubscribed for the
                    military. They had enough volunteers; they didn't have to draft people. He said
                    if you came back here and you simply start going to school again, with your
                    lottery number you'll go into the army almost immediately. So I decided to spend
                    a third year in Turkey. I was signed up for it, everything was approved, I was
                    going to spend a third year not teaching but working for the Ministry of
                    Tourism, which would have been great. By this time I spoke Turkish well, I knew
                    the country, I had English, etc. I had traveled all over Turkey. Everything was
                    set, and then all the universities in the country went off on a massive strike
                    in the spring of 1970. The strike went from week to week to week and ended up
                    with a whole series of demands being made by the strikers. One of them was that
                    all Americans had to leave Turkey. Well, the government decided, and I guess the
                    embassy decided, they certainly weren't going to sacrifice the U.S. bases, and
                    the American soldiers there, but to at least give a sop to the demonstrators,
                    they might as well let the Peace Corps go. We were the ones who were visible,
                    anyway. And we were the ones who looked suspicious, because nobody really knew
                    what we were doing. We were teachers - what does that mean? What does Peace
                    Corps mean? At that time, we were waging a major war. So the Peace Corps in
                    Ankara disbanded. That's fine. At the time that it was disbanding, I kept hoping
                    that we'd be able to stay on or I'd be able to stay on, not as a teacher, but at
                    the Ministry of Tourism. I walked into the Peace Corps office one day to discuss
                    this. It must have been in the early spring of 1970, and there was a notice on
                    the bulletin board there that an American archeologist was looking for an
                    assistant and an interpreter. I took the notice off, called and got in touch
                    with the person. We hit it off. He had just been given a license by the
                    Department of Archeology, the first foreign archeologist in years and years, to
                    go up all along the Black Sea coast and do a survey of potential excavation
                    sites. He offered me the job of going with him. The Peace Corps agreed to let me
                    go and continue as part of my Peace Corps service, pending what might happen at
                    the Ministry of Tourism, since this fit exactly into tourism anyway. So I went
                    off with him for several weeks and toured the entire Black Sea area - not toured
                    it, you know, staying in some pretty awful places - but got to see archeological
                    sites from Sinop to Trabzon.</p>

                <p>Today is May 18, 2000. Mike, you're at 1970, and you've just finished going
                    around looking at archeological sites on the Black Sea, was it?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Black Sea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so what did you do after you came back and went to
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That period, more to the end of the Peace Corps presence in Turkey, I
                    was one of the very last of the volunteers, probably the second or third last,
                    to leave the country. The Peace Corps presence left there because of the growing
                    anti-American feeling that was rising in the student body in Turkey, the leftist
                    press, etc. Turkey was going through a period of extreme civil problems, civil
                    unrest, if you will, and the Peace Corps was seen as too much of presence, too
                    obvious a presence. We were at all the Turkish universities, throughout Turkish
                    schools. They got rid of us. That was fine with me. Because the program was
                    ending so abruptly and so early, and because I had expected to spend a third
                    year in Turkey - I had made all my plans to do this. I had already been assigned
                    to a new position in Turkey in the Peace Corps - and suddenly found myself
                    without an assignment; and the Peace Corps in Washington offered several of us
                    Peace Corps assignments in other countries. On the list of countries was Iran.
                    Because I had been to Iran on a vacation and had really liked it and had wanted
                    to go back, I decided to go to Iran. I originally thought I would go there for
                    one year. That was my plan, to leave the Peace Corps after three years in the
                    Peace Corps. Instead, I went Iran and ended up liking it so much that I spent
                    three years more in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so I wonder, this was 1970 to '73 you were in Iran
                        in the Peace Corps. Well, let's talk about what you were doing, where you
                        were, and the state of things there at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Peace Corps training in Iran took place - it was all in Iran, unlike my
                    Peace Corps studies for Turkey, where I'd been trained in the United States
                    partially. All Peace Corps training for Iran was actually conducted in the
                    country of Iran. And I spent two to three months in the city of Hamadan in
                    western Iran. And my first assignment would be in the town of Sonqor (or
                    Songhor). Sonqor was a Turkic town surrounded by Kurds in Khorramshahr Province,
                    which is in western Iran. It was not very far from the border of Iraq, and the
                    town of Sonqor, according to local legend, had been founded by Bay Sonqor, the
                    grandson of Genghis Khan, who was allegedly in the area on a hunting trip and
                    had a hunting accident and broke his leg and had to camp there for several
                    months until he was recovered enough to leave. He liked the place, established a
                    tribal presence there, and the Turkish town of Sonqor came into being. Sonqor
                    has a Turkish name. The Turkish which is spoken there, according to linguists,
                    is closer to the Turkish of Central Asia, rather than the Turkish of Azerbaijan
                    and Turkey. Also, I noticed later that the carpet patterns, the ones that were
                    native to the people of Sonqor, I saw the exact pattern in carpets that came
                    straight out of Central Asia. In fact, I've made mistakes in thinking one carpet
                    was from Sonqor and it turned out to be directly from Bokhara. You see the
                    Bokhara city pattern as well. These patterns are only found in these two cities
                    as far as I know.</p>
                <p>I spent one year teaching in the local high school. I was responsible for all of
                    the first-year English classes in the two boys' schools. We had more than 200
                    students, and all the students had three English classes a week. It ended up
                    being a pretty full-time week. The students there were very different from the
                    university students in Turkey. Number one, they were all guys. First-year high
                    school, which meant an average in age of anything from 11 or 12 up to 18 or 19.
                    The first year high school was the year traditionally in Iran when students came
                    in from the villages to the nearest city or the nearest town to continue their
                    high school education. Most Iranian villages had up to the sixth grade or
                    seventh grade, but not much beyond that. This was the time when village students
                    were showing up. This meant that I had a very heavy contingent of Kurdish
                    students who had a lot of trouble speaking Persian, along with the town students
                    from Sonqor itself, who were basically Turks. So it was mixing Kurds and Turks,
                    almost no Persian presence at all. Persian was the state language, the official
                    language. Everyone in the town was trilingual. They all spoke Kurdish, Turkish,
                    and Persian, and I spoke Turkish and Persian, so that made me at least good in
                    two of the languages, and I learned to get along in Kurdish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Shah's government doing at this particular
                        time that you were seeing evidence of in Sonqor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, he was sending Peace Corps teachers, for example. The Shah's
                    government was trying to open up the education system, trying to spread literacy
                    in a country that had been historically illiterate. The closest friends I had
                    there were Iranian guys from the town, several of whom were village
                    schoolteachers. I met a group of guys my age very quickly after I got there.
                    They all had high school diplomas and they had been sent out to teach in various
                    of the villages around Sonqor, within one, two, three hours' walk. And they
                    became my friends, and I spent a lot of time, because of that, out in the
                    villages. That was one indication of what the Shah's government was doing,
                    making sure that at least basic literacy was getting to every nook and cranny of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>Other than that, there was a good clinic in the town - a couple of good clinics,
                    as a matter of fact. The town was small, by the way. It had 9,000 people.
                    Electricity had been brought in that year. It was the first time people had had
                    electricity. This meant, of course, very basic electricity, usually a light bulb
                    hanging from the ceiling, and that was it. And when I say light bulb, I mean
                    exactly that - a light bulb hanging from a wire. There were no televisions in
                    the town. There was no television reception in the town. I had a short-wave
                    radio, so I could pick up short-wave broadcasts. Other than that electricity was
                    not used for anything at all - maybe an occasional tape recorder, but not much
                    else. No televisions at all. The town was a strange and somehow very attractive
                    place as far as people were concerned. It was on a plateau, a large plateau
                    surrounded by mountains, and you had to pass through some pretty heavy mountains
                    to get to the town proper. I think that's why it retained its Turkic identity.
                    Nobody had gotten into that place or out of that place in so long.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The town of Sonqor, if you tried to go there up until World War II, the nearest
                    city was Khorramshahr, which was about four hours' drive away when I was there.
                    If you tried to go through Khorramshahr to Sonqor up through World War II, the
                    trip would have taken approximately one week by horseback, donkeyback, or
                    camelback. The path over the mountains is a rough one. There are a lot of
                    mountains in between. It's just a long, dry haul to get to the city. By the end
                    of World War II, my understanding is that the British Army and the American Army
                    had pushed through and at least leveled off somewhat a road you could drive a
                    jeep over, and the trip had gone from a week to the longer part of a day. The
                    road had improved considerably by the time I was there. We were serviced by a
                    bus and you could get there in approximately four hours from the city. The town
                    was certainly one of the most conservative towns anybody had ever seen in Iran.
                    Every woman in the town, with the exception of a single woman only - I can tell
                    you who she was - wore a full dark chador, a full black heavy veil that Muslim
                    women in Iran... that has become famous since the revolution. In the time I was
                    there, I rarely saw a woman's face. The society that I was in was totally male.
                    I had a landlady, of course, in the house that I shared with an Iranian family,
                    but I rarely saw her face. She would normally, as soon as I walked in from the
                    courtyard, cover herself up and then talk to me through her veil. Once in a
                    while, if things relaxed in the course of a day, I saw her face, but not very
                    often. Other than that, my best friends - and I found very good friends - and I
                    would only see the older women, for example their mothers or their grandmothers
                    occasionally - they'd be allowed to come out and talk to me. Other than that, I
                    never saw the women in any of the houses I went into. If I did see one, it would
                    be someone totally veiled who would simply say “Welcome,” or “Welcome to the
                    house,” and then would disappear. From then on I would only see a hand from
                    behind a wall holding trays of different foods. If you had been dropped in from
                    outer space you would have assumed that only men existed in the city except for
                    lumps of black walking around the streets in heavy black veils. There was no
                    cinema in the town. Someone had tried to build a cinema there. He was warned by
                    the local clergy that this was a sin because films and the cinema industry were
                    anathema to Islam. He persisted, and he died. And the clergy then collected
                    money in the mosque to help pay his wife through gifts so that she would not
                    starve. He was killed for trying to build a cinema. Other than that, it was a
                    very pleasant time. I had no problems there. I had a lot of friendships there. I
                    still get telephone calls from people in the town on holidays, Christmas,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what was the situation that you were seeing in
                        Iran? How was the Shah perceived at this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>METRINKO: 1970. The Shah was very much disliked in the town that I was in. The
                    town had, for pro forma reasons, requested permission to put up a statue of the
                    Shah and was turned down by the palace, which refused to give them permission to
                    put up a statue. The town was known in the area of Khorramshahr, in joking, as
                    “Stalingrad.” It was a town that had been heavily influenced by the Tudeh Party,
                    the old pro-Communist party. It was a town of separatists. A lot of people in
                    the town had died fighting the Shah's armies. The people were not pro-Shah at
                    all. There were pro-forma celebrations on the Shah's birthday and at other
                    times, but in general the feeling was rather anti-Shah. One example I can give,
                    I have a photograph of myself that was taken by someone else in Songhor at the
                    time of the Shah's birthday in November, 1970. It was a little celebration with
                    the normal folkloric dances and people like that in the central square of the
                    town, and I was standing with a friend who was one of the local bank presidents.
                    We were standing at the edge of the maidan. Somebody was giving a speech, and
                    approximately every 20 or 30 seconds he would call out, “Shahanshah aryah mehr!”
                    And everybody would clap. My friend would clap, too. This means, “Shah of shahs,
                    the light of the Aryans.” It was a title used by the Shah. I turned to my friend
                    the banker, and I said, “Why are you clapping? You can't hear anything he's
                    saying? I can't.” And he looked at me and said, in a whisper, “If I don't clap
                    now, I'll be in jail tonight.” So I started to clap, too, whenever they'd say
                    “Shahanshah aryah mehr!” That man, by the way, later on, after the revolution,
                    became one of the heads of the regional Islamic banking system. He was put in
                    charge of a big chunk of the country to turn the banking system Islamic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were from America. Did they kind of know what America
                        was, have any feeling for it? Or were you just a helping hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, the Iranians never accept the idea of somebody helping them. They
                    are the most suspicious people in the world and accept nothing at face value.
                    There was a basic assumption that I was a spy of some sort or there for some
                    nefarious purpose. That did not stop the friendships because Iranians accept
                    nefarious purposes as part of their culture. They never quite knew whether I was
                    working for their own government or another government. Most of the people in
                    the town would not have known where America was, no. For example, I was invited
                    once to dinner to the home of one of the other teachers, and his wife was
                    present at the dinner. That was a bit unusual. This was an educated family, by
                    the way. And after the dinner was over, the wife looked at me and, addressing me
                    directly, said, “You're probably wondering why we invited you for dinner
                    tonight.” Well, I had been wondering. And she said, “The reason is that I have a
                    brother who's living in your country, and I thought that if we became friendly
                    with you, you might have your family invite my brother to dinner at your place.”
                    I said, “That's great.” I said, “What's his address?” And she went and got a
                    piece of paper and handed me his address, and he was living in Frankfurt,
                    Germany. I looked at it and said, “But I live in the United States of America.”
                    And, “Yes.” She assumed they were the same place. If you were from America, you
                    were just from out there. Now that changed absolutely 100 percent in a few
                    years.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we're sticking to this '70 to '73 period. What were
                        you picking up? Because this is always a very... this area, I would assume,
                        had been one in which there were unpleasant neighbors around, not only
                        Iranian, but you had Iraqis and Turks. In typical way, how were relations
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Relations with Iraq... the Iranians and the Iraqis had had relations
                    for 3000 years. It's been hot and cold throughout the length of that 3000 years.
                    They've been fighting with each other and visiting each other and trading with
                    each other constantly through that whole period. The Persian Empire wiped out
                    the Babylonian Empire. That was only the beginning, and it's gone back and
                    forth, back and forth, back and forth all along. When in I was in Iran in the
                    early '70s, the business of border security had been turned over in large part
                    to the Kurdish tribes who lived on the border. The Kurdish tribes went back and
                    forth; each came into the other's country all the time. People visited, they did
                    trading, they did black market smuggling all the time. Also, despite flare-ups
                    and the Shah supporting Kurds in Iraq, for example, in Iraq in this period lived
                    some of the major Iranian Shiite religious leaders. They lived in the shrine
                    city of Najaf. There was a huge Shiite presence in Iraq - still is, the Shiite
                    religion of Iran - and a lot of religious leaders went back and forth
                    constantly. Khomeini lived in Iraq at that point. There were Iranian religious
                    families living around the shrines of Iraq who had been there for hundreds of
                    years but still considered themselves Iranian, and they had Iranian passports.
                    Was there a problem? Well, for one part of that period, you couldn't visit Iraq.
                    In fact, Iran accepted a lot of Kurdish refugees from Iraq who had fled across
                    the border. For other periods of time, it was fine. One could go easily - not
                    Americans, particularly - but people could go easily, and Iranian pilgrims
                    always visited Iraq. So was it a friendly border? No, but it was a much-traveled
                    border, and people did go back and forth, and there were treaties between the
                    two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any repercussions of that, or was that farther
                        away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It didn't touch me at all. To the best of my knowledge, none of the
                    refugee Kurds came into the Sonqor area. I only saw them later, up in the
                    Caspian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relations between the Turkic and Kurdish
                        speakers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In Sonqor it was absolutely fine. They all spoke each other's
                    languages, and in fact most of them were intermarried. I don't think there were
                    any pure Turkic peoples or pure Kurdish peoples there. The language you spoke...
                    people would routinely, for social reasons, use all three languages. So even
                    illiterate villagers or illiterate townspeople, who had had no formal education
                    at all, spoke all three.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the value of teaching English at this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: My students could never understand. The value of teaching English was
                    that the Shah had realized that if anyone wanted to really go past small town
                    life in Iran, if they wanted to go off the university, English was going to be a
                    requirement. The books of the world are written in English, and technical
                    subjects are taught in English best. At the time the Shah was developing a very
                    good military relationship with the United States, and the Iranian helicopter
                    system, weapons system, the airplane system, were all being provided by the
                    United States. It required knowledge of English to buy this, to maintain it, to
                    continue dealing with it. He wanted his soldiers to speak English. The soldiers
                    came from small towns. Well, he wanted kids in school to start doing English
                    then so they could continue using it as they got older, and the Shah had always
                    been an Anglophile, in his own way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your students reacting to learning a fourth
                        language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It depended. I had students with whom I am still in touch from that
                    period, who studied in high school under me and who learned English extremely
                    well. It opened up a way of getting out of the town or going off to university,
                    because they had good English [skills]. And several of my friends now are guys
                    who studied English under me at that school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned, was it Tudeh party? What was both local
                        Communist and Soviet Communist influence in the area that you were seeing at
                        that time - or did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The presence of the secret police was so strong, or the implied
                    presence of it-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about SAVAK.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: SAVAK - was strong and so heavy that nobody would have spoken to me
                    about a Tudeh activity or Communist Party activity, but there was also an
                    underlying current of anti-Shah feeling linked to everything. Could I say that
                    this person or that person was a Communist? No. But I could certainly think of
                    all sorts of people I knew there who were anti-Shah. What did I actually see in
                    the way of political activity or sort of underground activity by the Tudeh Party
                    or by any of the other opposition groups? Nothing, per se. But the town itself
                    became a real hotbed of revolution as soon as the revolution started in
                    1978.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that for a normal secret policeman
                        who ends up in a small town - I mean we all know how the system works - you
                        don't get your smoothest operators there. Just having an American teaching
                        there even though the Shah was fomenting this would have been highly
                        suspicious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, I'm sure they had a lot of fun watching me.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, and here you are messing around with the young... what passed for
                    intellectuals... anyway, the people who were going to be in Iran, the young
                    people in an area that's not very friendly to the Shah. Did you feel the hand of
                    the police?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Not specifically, although as a teacher, subject to the regulations of
                    the Ministry of Education, there was a heavy hand on all of us. For example, I
                    was not allowed to leave the town without getting permission from the head of
                    the school, and you had to get this every time you wanted to leave the area of
                    the town. It wasn't difficult for me to get it; he always gave it when I wanted
                    to go away, but I still had to obtain it so they would know where I was. Other
                    teachers had to do this as well. Did they watch me specifically? I'm sure they
                    did. I'm sure I was great practice for them. But was I ever told not to do this
                    or not to go there? No, not really. I think there were more interested to see
                    who would become friendly with me than what I would be doing.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: In 1971, I was invited to participate in a seminar the Peace Corps had
                    agreed to run for one of the training colleges. It was up on the Caspian, and it
                    was supposed to be an intensive English seminar, where approximately 100
                    students from one particular small university, a college that is a university
                    now, were going to spend six weeks of the summer studying English intensively.
                    The head of the school was very interested in this. The Peace Corps contacted
                    me. I volunteered to go up and do this, too. I think there were about 14 or 15
                    teachers there from the Peace Corps. From the very first moment I arrived there,
                    I thought it was great. I finally had students in front of me who seriously
                    wanted to learn English. They were older, they were intelligent, it was a very,
                    very good college and really cream of the crop students. And the education
                    experience was totally different than I'd been having in high school. The high
                    school experience, I should say, was... Did you ever see Blackboard Jungle?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was sort of like that, except that you had to use your fists in
                    almost every class to keep order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good heavens.</hi>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I was teaching in rooms where I would have 70 or 80 young male
                    students, all of whom were in their teens. Imagine a room with 75 guys in it,
                    all cramped in together and sitting four people to a bench that would only hold
                    two comfortably, and they were between the ages of 13 and 18. And you are a
                    foreign teacher. It wasn't only me. I adapted quickly to the teaching methods.
                    On first entering the school system there, one of the other teachers, a very
                    pleasant man, asked me if I would like to watch his classes first just to see
                    what the teaching methods are in the town. I thought this was a good idea. I
                    went into one of his classes, and I saw him turn from a pleasant, amiable
                    gentleman who spoke quite decent English into a sort of monster, smashing
                    students, screaming at them, insulting them. I didn't say anything. We walked
                    out of the classroom, and I told him I could never teach like this, this wasn't
                    the American way, it was counter-productive - all those fine words. These were
                    the hope of Iran, the youngsters who were going to lead the country, etc. He
                    told me that - I'm still a friend of this guy, by the way, all these years later
                    - what he said was, “Michael, in this town, our students get beaten up by their
                    fathers, they get beaten by their brothers, they get beaten by everybody in the
                    alleys they live in. They only understand force. If you try to talk to them
                    nicely or if you are too polite, they will think you are weak. I told him - I
                    assured him - he was wrong. For the next several days, until the end of the
                    week, I tried teaching the liberal, pleasant, nice way I had been able to do in
                    Turkey in the university, and by the end of the third class or so in each of my
                    classrooms not only was I being ignored by the students, they didn't even
                    acknowledge my presence in the room. They were throwing things, fighting with
                    each other, and basically having a free-for-all before I entered. I thought
                    about this over the weekend, and at the beginning of the second week of school
                    walked into one of my first pandemonium classes, walked over to the biggest
                    student in the room and beat him up in front of the others. The class went
                    silent. I walked out, came back in, everyone stood up. I said, “Good morning.”
                    They said, “Good morning.” I looked at them and said, “Page one, open it.” And I
                    had great classes for the rest of the year - but it involved, every week in each
                    of the classes, physically beating somebody. This was accepted and common. It
                    was considered routine teaching practice. And you could use your fists, though
                    that wasn't really encouraged because you could hurt your fists on students.
                    Usually what you just did was throw them out into the hallway and summon the
                    prefect of discipline, who was walking up and down the hallways with a stick or
                    a length of rubber hose and who would simply lay into them as soon as they
                    landed in the hallway. We routinely performed massive physical intimidation on
                    the students to keep them quiet. That included up to use of the bastinado.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's hitting somebody on the bare feet with a rubber
                        hose or two sticks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Two teachers holding the student upside down about half a foot off the
                    floor and a third teacher beating the soles of his feet with either a rubber
                    hose or a stick. It's very effective. I had great classes all year, and I was
                    able to teach a lot of English. A lot of my students learned English. A lot of
                    my students got severely beaten by me as well. But it was the only way to
                    survive there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Completely. This was like penitentiary life without bars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you? This was on the Caspian Sea, or -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What I've been describing has been Sonqor and the teaching methods
                    there. The Caspian Sea, number one, half my students were girls, and very
                    pleasant girls. None of them were teenage males. They were university students
                    at school in Teheran. These students were all interested, intelligent, and
                    eager. The students at this school had all been chosen by scholarship. They were
                    there because they had already spent several years as teachers themselves. It
                    was called the Literacy Corps Teacher Training College. The school only took
                    people who had a minimum of several years of teaching experience behind them,
                    gave them full scholarships to come do a four-year degree program. In Iran at
                    the time you could teach up through high school with only a high school diploma
                    yourself. It's probably changed by now, but at that time you could have a high
                    school diploma and become a teacher. So we were teaching people who had several
                    years of teaching experience and had gotten there by scholarship. They were
                    interested, eager, industrious, etc. It was like a dream school - beautiful
                    campus, everything was wonderful about it. They had a summer campus up in the
                    Caspian where I was. I developed a lot of friendships with students there, and
                    the president of the school asked if I would consider transferring to the school
                    full time, become an English teacher at the school itself and continue teaching
                    at the college level. I thought about this for all of maybe a minute and decided
                    this would be a great idea. It was the difference between going back and
                    basically flailing away at unwilling teenagers or continuing in the university
                    environment. There was no choice.</p>
                <p>So it got arranged. The Peace Corps had no problem with it, and the president of
                    the university was a good friend of... in fact, he had been the Shah's tutor,
                    and they just gave the necessary orders and the Ministry of Education arranged
                    my transfer, and it was all done immediately.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the name of this school?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: In Persian it was the Danesh Serai Aliyh Sepahi Danesh - the Literacy
                    Corps Teacher Training College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was it located now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Physically the campus was near the town of Varamin, about 30 kilometers
                    outside of Teheran. A very nice campus, it had been an old agricultural
                    facility. In fact, the original facility had been put up by AID after World War
                    II, what was then called Point Four. It was a beautiful campus, some fine old
                    buildings, and a lot of nice, new buildings. I had a beautiful office with large
                    windows overlooking a nice green campus that was watered and rose beds all the
                    time. A great place. Tennis court, swimming pool - the whole bit. A nice Peace
                    Corps experience, too, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from, what, '71 to '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe how you saw the attitude of these
                        students - I mean, obviously we're talking about an elite - and your
                        relationship with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The students, first of all, came from cities and towns all over the
                    country. They weren't from one town. So they represented every tribal group,
                    every religious group in the country. There were Christian students. There were
                    Shiite students. There were Sunni students. I had Kurds and Turks and Armenians
                    and this and that and Gashgahi, people from the Caspian, people from, you know,
                    the Afghan areas, and from up in northern Khorrasan. Arab students from the Arab
                    provinces. It was a whole mixture. Every one of them was there on a government
                    scholarship, every one of them had been a government teacher. There was a great
                    deal of activism there, certainly a lot more open talk about SAVAK, what it was
                    doing, a lot more open talk about politics. No one in public would criticize the
                    Shah, because you could be put in prison for doing that, but privately many of
                    them did to me. Some of the students were reputed to be members of various
                    underground groups, and at least one of my students was executed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they trying to sound you out, drag you in, involve
                        you, or how did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I wouldn't say that because, there too, none of them knew where I was
                    really from. They had a far better idea, of course, of the United States in
                    politics, probably a better idea of the American-Iranian political relationship
                    than I had. But were they trying to sound me out? Yes. I would joke about things
                    that they did not. They could lose a lot more than me by reading the wrong book.
                    I had a roommate from the school my third year who, I know, was pulled in by
                    SAVAK and told that he had to report about me, what I did. And it really
                    frightened him. He told me all about it. He really got frightened. So we agreed
                    that he had better start reporting things that they would have found out
                    anyway.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a drive to try and go to the United
                        States to be educated later, because as a consular officer elsewhere I know
                        roving bands of Iranian usually young men were all over Europe trying to get
                        visas to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The time period here is the crucial thing. My Peace Corps experience in
                    Iran was from 1970 to 1973. The oil money was just filtering in. Up until 1970,
                    the normal Iranian did not have a car, did not have a television, did not have a
                    telephone. When I went to call from Sonqor to Teheran - forget calling outside
                    of Iran, it was not possible - but to make a call from Sonqor, my first Peace
                    Corps site, to the Peace Corps headquarters, for example, in Teheran, I would
                    have to go to the post office on one of the two days when we had a telephone
                    connection open, stand in line, and it was only open for a couple of hours when
                    the town was given the rights to use the telephone lines. And you had to
                    register your name, give the number, and eventually somebody would start to
                    connect. It was a matter of using old phones that had the turn handles on the
                    side and a telephone operator would keep twirling this and saying,
                    “Khorramshahr, this is Sonqor, Khorramshahr - Sonqor - can you hear me?” And
                    Khorramshahr would then pass you down the line to the next city, Hamadan.
                    Hamadan would pass you down to Zanjan, and you could hear all the operators
                    talking to each other: “Zanjan, this is Hamadan. We need a line to Teheran.” And
                    it was done that way. I say that because it's an indication of the sort of
                    communication in the country. There wasn't any feasible way to get information
                    there, if you were in a small town. There was no money. There were no cars in
                    the towns when I was there in the Peace Corps the first year. I have pictures of
                    the town taken in 1970, on regular working days when you could see the dirt
                    street from one end of the town to the other, and there would be one jeep parked
                    on the side, and that was it. By 1975, 1976, there were traffic jams all the
                    time because people suddenly... the oil money just spread all over the place,
                    and if you didn't have access to oil money per se, you had access to the jobs
                    that the oil was creating - the construction boom. So people had money. Once
                    they got the money, it meant that all sorts of people would then look out of
                    Iran for education. And Iranians have always been interested in education and in
                    traveling. They like to travel. It's just part of them. There are countries
                    whose people never travel. Iranians like to travel. I think that may be one
                    reason they had so many shrines - because they liked to travel to them. So once
                    you had a family sending a nephew or, say, a son to the United States, then this
                    would attract others in the family. The mother would go on a visit, the sister
                    would want to go on a visit, the younger brother would look at this and say, “If
                    Farid went, I want to go too.” Another nephew, another cousin behind it. And
                    this sort of skyrocketed in the course of just a few years. But up until
                    1970-71, very, very rare, exceptional students.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Now, in my second Peace Corps site, in the training college, they had a program
                    where they would take the top several students of every graduating class and
                    give them fellowships to go to the United States or to England to study. They
                    liked the United States. They would send them off, and they could get their
                    master's degree and their doctorates in the US, and a lot of my students from
                    that time came here and do have doctorates. Some of them are still here. But
                    there was that focus by the government ministries also, sending people out, and
                    the government ministries did have direct access to oil money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody was sort of on the government payroll,
                        essentially, there. Did this keep down political activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It did, and it didn't. I'll give you an example. One of my favorite
                    students, a girl, was arrested when I was there, and I knew she had been
                    arrested. All the students talked about it. The head of the school was a good
                    friend of mine. He told me she'd been arrested. And through a combination of
                    totally accidental circumstances, I was able to follow her case until the day
                    when she was eventually released. I was sitting in an Iranian friend's house
                    when this girl's father and uncles came to try and get my Iranian friend to
                    intercede with the Shah. The Iranian friend I was with did not realize that I
                    knew the girl. He had no way to know this. He was a very upper-class Iranian, a
                    friend of the Shah, who was writing a book in English, needed some help editing
                    it, and had found me through friends and just asked if I'd be interested, sort
                    of pro bono, helping him to edit this book. I agreed to do it because of a
                    common interest in it. I would sit in his garden... in fact, he lived in one of
                    the Shah's old houses that was given as a gift. I would sit in his garden every
                    weekend, the whole of a Friday or Saturday, have lunch with him, and we would
                    just go over his manuscript of the preceding week. It was great fun. Except one
                    day a whole group of people from the town of Shiraz came to see him, came into
                    the garden. He told me what it was about in English, even though I was following
                    all the Persian, and said, “Here was the daughter of “ “this girl has been
                    arrested, and they want to get her out of prison, and they hope that I can do it
                    as a friend of the Shah. I've been waiting for them to come to see me.” I heard
                    the family explain the whole thing, and none of the family knew that I spoke
                    Persian or that I knew their daughter. They had no way of knowing this. But
                    eventually, she was released at least temporarily and then re-arrested. I saw
                    her the day she was released. Yes, there was that activism. She was picked up
                    for reading the wrong books, political books, things like that, nothing that
                    anyone would consider anything at all in the United States. But in Iran, reading
                    was heavily censored. Did other people complain about the government? Yes. Did
                    they do it all the time or too vocally? No. Did people go to prison there? Yes.
                    A couple of times students from my classes disappeared, and I would be told that
                    so-and-so was in prison, and I just sort of ignored it for a while. They usually
                    came back out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about - again, I'm sticking to this '70-73 period -
                        the influence of the mullahs and religion and that sort of thing? I mean,
                        how were you observing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It was always very strong. The students that I was dealing with...
                    Well, in my first Peace Corps site, everybody was ostensibly very conservative,
                    very religious. There was no alcohol in the town, there was no cinema in the
                    town, women were all dressed right to the tops of their heads in heavy dark
                    veils. It was everything that Khomeini could have wanted in a post-revolutionary
                    town. So when people today talk about how Iran was so different under the Shah,
                    that's bullshit. Much of Iran was as heavily conservative as it is today. That
                    having been said, my students at the university level, I'd say that a fair
                    number of them were strongly religious. If they had alcohol, it would be a beer
                    now and then, nothing else, very unlike the Turkish students I had had. They
                    were religious, they prayed, most of them. It was very common to see people
                    praying at prayer times on campus. Girls, even if they weren't wearing veils,
                    they were still conservative acting. I got into some of the Sufi circles, the
                    Iranian mystic circles, when I was there, because I was studying at the
                    University of Teheran at night, and some of my students were involved in Sufi
                    mysticism. I was invited to spend a couple of evenings at one of the Sufi
                    monasteries out in the western part of Iran and did so. I got to know some
                    clergy there, very different from the traditional Shiite clergy, but still a
                    religious part of the country expressing itself in a traditional religious way.
                    I didn't hang around with wild people. Most of the people I knew were observant,
                    or at least quietly observant or quietly observant Christians too, because there
                    were Armenian and Syrian students. But there was no wild stuff; they were all
                    quite conservative.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you have any contact or feel for the embassy or the American
                    presence while you were there?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, I'm trying to think. Not really. I mean, I went to the Peace
                    Corps office occasionally, got my mail at the Peace Corps office. Other than
                    that, the embassy occasionally for a hamburger or a cheeseburger, something of
                    that sort, but not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't being impacted upon by Bell Helicopter or
                        mechanics and all that, which were elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>METRINKO. No. Well, one thing was changing, and this is what stopped the Peace
                    Corps in Iran, too. That presence was just building up as my Peace Corps
                    assignment was winding down. That presence came in when the Shah had enough
                    money from oil to start buying big-time. It started in 1972-73. By 1973, it was
                    very, very easy to get a job teaching English, for example, for the Iranian
                    military through a Bell contractor or other contract. They were desperately
                    seeking out native English speakers because they had to start teaching vast
                    numbers of Iranian soldiers and helicopter and airplane technicians how to speak
                    English. I could have left the Peace Corps and gotten a job teaching English for
                    10 times what I was getting paid by the Peace Corps and still have the Peace
                    Corps experience. I didn't because I was close to the end of my time anyway and
                    because the American Embassy, apparently, was so upset about the types of
                    jobs... not so upset - they were trying to save the Peace Corps and had gotten
                    the agreement of some of the companies not to hire Peace Corps volunteers who
                    were still active Peace Corps volunteers. As it turned out, the Peace Corps
                    basically disappeared of its own weight, the weight of changing times, about a
                    year or two after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '73 what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In 1973, I had gone to graduate school; I had also taken the Foreign
                    Service Exam. I took the Foreign Service Exam in Teheran. I passed the written
                    part of the exam, received a letter telling me that I should report for an oral
                    exam, and left Iran, having applied for graduate school and having gone through
                    at least one half of the State Department examination process, went back to the
                    United States, took the oral almost immediately after getting back, was told
                    immediately that I had passed it, and was also told that within a few months I'd
                    be getting a call to come to one of the classes. I received the letter from the
                    State Department and the letters accepting me into all graduate schools the same
                    week.</p>
                <p>I had planned to go on to graduate study in Middle Eastern affairs. Two of the
                    schools offered me fellowships. I knew that it would take me another four years
                    at least to get a doctorate. I wanted to go into the Foreign Service eventually
                    one day anyway, and at the time, because of the way Foreign Service accepted
                    entrants, I was going to be given as high a salary as I could get even with a
                    Ph.D. anyway, based on the Peace Corps experience and five years of work. So I
                    just looked at it and thought, I'd rather have the State Department pay for all
                    the education than go into debt getting it myself, especially if the result is
                    that I still want to go into the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I came into the Foreign Service in one of the classes in 1974. I had a
                    temporary job at the Internal Revenue Service for several months, knowing that I
                    was just waiting to go into to the State Department. The IRS knew it too. It was
                    a job in my home town.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, do you recall any of the questions or the
                        formulation of the oral examination at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The oral exam was given in Rosslyn, at one of the new high-rise
                    buildings there. I went before a panel of, I think, four people, one of whom was
                    a woman. They asked me basic questions about my experience in the Peace Corps,
                    where I had been, what I had done, something about my languages. It was very
                    pleasant. They posed a question about the evacuation of American citizens and
                    asked me to sort of talk about what I might look at if I had to be in charge of
                    an evacuation, with whom would I get in contact, what would I do if I were
                    evacuating. It was all rather simple, very pleasant, probably 15 or 20 minutes.
                    It was more like a social conversation than an examination. And I left, and they
                    came out about five minutes later and said, “You've passed the exam. Now just
                    wait for the letter.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in '74 you started the process. Can you talk about it?
                        What was your impression of you're A-100, the basic officer course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I thought it was pretty good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I wasn't there
                    for a lot of it because I got hauled out immediately into a Cyprus task force.
                    The Turks had just invaded Cyprus, and -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July 14, I think, 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't remember the date at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I had been consul general in Athens for four years,
                        and I had just left on the first of July. I would get the hell out and get
                        back to the States, and so I recall it vividly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, well, the junior officer course started in, I think, late June. As
                    soon as the invasion started, the State Department put together a task force. I
                    volunteered for that because I spoke Turkish and I knew the area, and I was
                    there for about two weeks, and that was that. So much for junior officer
                    orientation. I had a good class. I still see friends from the class. But it was
                    a good class. A variety of people are still at work in the Department. Many have
                    left, of course.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, then, what did you want to do? Did you want to go right back to where
                    you'd been?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, actually, when I left Iran, I took a slow trip back. It took about
                    six weeks. I hitchhiked out of Iran. I hitchhiked in and out of Iran many times
                    in the course of those years. I hitchhiked out of Iran, across the border,
                    hitchhiked around eastern Turkey, traveled with a Turkish friend hitchhiking
                    around southern Turkey for a couple of weeks, and really said goodbye to Turkey
                    and Iran. I wanted to go into the Foreign Service to see other parts of the
                    world. Then as they started to talk about personnel assignments, the guy who was
                    our personnel counselor at the time went on and on about how it's the new
                    Foreign Service, with the open assignments process, and you can go anywhere in
                    the world that you'd like to go, and these are the possibilities, and you're
                    lucky because you're in a rank where you can really do anything at all, and this
                    is the start of a whole new life. And I looked at the list, and there were
                    really some great places on there. And when it came my turn to have my career
                    counseling session, the onward assignment counseling session, he looked at me
                    and said, “Where have you been thinking?” I said, well, this one, this one, this
                    one all sound great. He said, “What about Turkey?” And I said, “No, thanks, I've
                    just been there.” Again he said, “Well, what about Turkey?” I said, “No, I just
                    got out of Turkey. I just was there a matter of weeks ago.” And then I got
                    suspicious and said, “You've told us that we can ask for anything in the world
                    that's on the list. There are lots of places here” - Southeast Asia, the
                    Pacific, etc. He said, “Yes, well, you know there's a job that we might be able
                    to get for you in Addis Ababa.” I said, “There's a civil war going on there now.
                    Isn't the embassy closed or closing?” He said, “Well, yes, but what about
                    Ankara? Have you thought about that?” Well, the upshot was that I found myself
                    back in Ankara. They needed somebody who spoke Turkish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Ankara from '74 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: '74 to '76. I had just left Ankara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that takes all the fun out of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I spent my vacation money in Ankara saying goodbye to Ankara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Ankara, when you went there, what was
                        your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: When I went there I was so new to the Foreign Service, I had missed the
                    part of the orientation because I was Cyprus task force, about informing the
                    embassy that I was arriving. So I simply went, picked up the ticket, left, and
                    went to Ankara. It was possible to do this. I got to Ankara, spent a couple of
                    days with friends, went up to the embassy one morning and said, “Here I am.” And
                    it was quite a surprise to Ankara that I was there already. They had assumed
                    somehow that I'd be in language training for a couple of months.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Well, my first job, I was, according to what the personnel system had told me, I
                    was going to be 90 percent consular officer and occasionally fill in when
                    somebody was absent from the political section. I got to Ankara and discovered
                    the embassy had a different version of that, and it was 90 percent political
                    officer, occasionally filling in- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was '74-'76. Who was the ambassador when you got there,
                        the DCM, and a little about your impression of the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador was William Butts Macomber, who was a political
                    appointee, who had been a political appointee with the State Department for, I
                    think it was, about 20 years. He had been head of administration; he had been
                    staff aide to John Foster Dulles, Dean Acheson. The DCM the whole time I was
                    there was Donald Burgess, who was a straight career employee, an old Middle East
                    hand, who went on from there to become our ambassador in Khartoum. Macomber went
                    on from there to become the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Both
                    professional, both good in their own way. I'm trying to think of some of the
                    other people at the embassy. I can go through naming lots of people's names,
                    personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We don't need that, but what was your impression? Was it a
                        happy embassy? How did it run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Was it a happy embassy? No. I'd say there was a fair amount of tension
                    in the embassy. Individuals there were happy, depending on whether or not they
                    were acclimated to Turkey. I went there having Turkish friends all over Ankara,
                    all over Turkey, speaking the language, so it was different for me. I was just
                    coming back home again. But for a lot of people there it was a foreign
                    experience they did not like.</p>
                <p>What can I say? My job there was supposed to be, as I said, consular, part-time
                    political. Instead just a few days after my arrival, the staff aide's father got
                    seriously ill, and the staff aide had to leave for two weeks. I was told to
                    report to the ambassador's office, being the youngest piece of meat, I guess, in
                    the political section, and found myself a staff aide for the next two weeks,
                    hated every second of it because the ambassador, while he definitely had gifts,
                    was also a workaholic who had no life outside the embassy and expected his staff
                    to be there the whole time, too. I spent two weeks hating it, just waiting for
                    the staff aide to get back. The staff aide returned. The ambassador called us
                    into his office and announced that he had decided that the staff aide needed
                    some broadening experience and would go to the Political Section and I would be
                    the new staff aide. I was the ambassador's staff aide for a full year. It was a
                    definite learning experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told Macomber had a well-deserved reputation for his
                        anger. I mean he would blow up, but it didn't last long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Macomber went up and down, hot and cold, from frigid to volcanic,
                    approximately 15 time an hour. You never knew, when you were walking in with him
                    or talking with him, whether he was going to explode or love you. You never
                    knew. It was very, very difficult to deal with him. He was extremely sharp. An
                    intelligent person, he liked Turkey, the Turks liked him. At least, the Turks
                    like him for what they saw, the good side of him. I remember once a Turkish
                    friend of mine from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a woman, was at one of his
                    receptions, and she and I were talking, and someone made a comment about how
                    pleasant the ambassador was, and she looked at me and she said, “You know, he's
                    so nice to me now because I come and see him from the minister” - she was one of
                    the minister's secretaries, minister of foreign affairs - “he's always so
                    pleasant and so charming when he's seeing me, but he doesn't know that I used to
                    be an operator at the military base here, and I would have to deal with him late
                    at night when he was trying to get calls through to the United States, and he
                    would curse at me.” He always forgot that. He never remembered that the person
                    he needed right now was the one he had just cursed at and insulted a minute
                    back. He was definitely sharp and knew the Washington world. He was extremely
                    hospitable, and some of the things he did in the embassy I've tried to use
                    through my whole career because I thought they were great. He was the most
                    democratic person I've ever seen, and he really did believe that everyone in the
                    embassy should use the ambassador's residence all the time - whether or not they
                    wanted to. This meant that if he was having a dinner for a Rockefeller and it
                    was going to be a sit-down dinner for six people, one of the six might be a GSO
                    FSN or a driver, and another one was going to be Princess So-and-so who was
                    passing through the city, and the other was going to be a junior officer. He had
                    a standing rule about including everybody in everything, and his hospitality was
                    extraordinarily good and effective. He could meet anybody whenever he wanted to,
                    and he made it very clear to everyone in the embassy, from the Marine guards to
                    the FSNs to this to that, that he wanted us at the residence to share things,
                    and we were all considered equals. I was at so many events there because of
                    that, unlike any other ambassador. I know, I've met, many ambassadors who had no
                    idea that they had junior officers in the embassy, but only knew their political
                    counselor and DCM and that was that. Macomber was exactly the opposite, very
                    effective and got himself into some very amusing and unusual situations because
                    of this focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do any come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, sure. One came to mind. His standard thing, when he was
                    inviting FSNs or embassy staff to the house, was please bring a Turkish friend.
                    This was partly to make the events representational, and he had to have more
                    than 50 per cent [non-] American presence or embassy presence. And one day he
                    decided to invite all the Marines for some event or other. All the Marine guards
                    were supposed to come. You always got fed well at his place. So he invited the
                    Marine detachment, as many of them as could be off duty. And they thought this
                    was great. Now we had a funny Marine detachment there. It may have been the most
                    unusual one in the world at the time. The gunny rarely spent time at the
                    embassy. One of the USMC sergeants - I've forgotten his title now - was working
                    part-time and living at a house of prostitution. He was the bouncer at the
                    house. I only found this out because I was talking to him once very, very late
                    at night when I'd been called in for some duty and asked him if he spoke
                    Turkish, and he started to speak to me in Turkish that was absolutely fluent and
                    beautiful except it was gutter Turkish of the worst, vile type. I asked him
                    where he had learnt it, and he told me that his girlfriend was the madam of the
                    local house of prostitution and he stayed there with her as the bouncer. Because
                    all the Marines wanted to bring girls to this reception, the whorehouse closed
                    down for the evening, and they escorted prostitutes. It was one of the better
                    receptions ever held at the residence, and the ambassador kept saying, “Gee,
                    it's so nice that the Marines know such lovely young Turkish girls.” But
                    everybody had a great time, and the ambassador, I don't think, ever found
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Mrs. Macomber? She had been John Foster
                        Dulles's secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Very, very professional, lovely person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard very fine things about her, and as a staff aide

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Dealings with her, she was always pleasant. She was very professional
                    and sometimes acted a bit like the dragon secretary that she had been,
                    protective of the Secretary. But she was fine. She had a good sense of humor,
                    also -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Phyllis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Phyllis Macomber. Also very hospitable. I liked her. I mean, I still
                    do. She was always pleasant, and very old-school. This was still back in the
                    days when... I think the year before or two years before they had stopped rating
                    spouses. It had been a very recent change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just about that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>METRINKO: And she was definitely old-school, as was the DCM's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The DCM Don Burgess's wife, again, very professional, very old-school,
                    white gloves, the whole bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you arrived there in 1974, and of course you
                        had already talked about the Cyprus thing, and '74-76 was not a very good
                        period in Turkish-American relations, mainly due to the Greek lobby and
                        particularly Greek congressmen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had the Greek lobby, we had an arms embargo against Turkey, so that
                    no armaments could come there, which made the military relationship a bit
                    delicate. But we also had Turkey in CENTO. CENTO headquarters was in Ankara, and
                    so there were American diplomats assigned to CENTO headquarters, and we had a
                    lot of visits because of CENTO. Turkey was in NATO, so we had Alexander Haig
                    showing up frequently there. We had Kissinger there several times. The
                    combination of Kissinger, Haig, other visitors - there was just a steady stream
                    of very high-ranking American visitors there all the time. So I got to meet
                    Kissinger, I got to meet Haig, etc., any number of senators. Congressmen and
                    senators were always there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As so often happens in the American body politic, you have
                        the executive - the President, the Secretary of State, and all of that - and
                        we have a very solid relationship with Turkey, and it makes very good sense;
                        and then you have on the Congressional side, next to the Jewish lobby, the
                        Greek lobby is probably as strong as any ethnic lobby in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And the Cuban-Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Cuban-Americans probably even smaller, but the
                        Greek lobby is all over the place, even more than the Jewish lobby, and a
                        big number of Greek-American congressmen. And my time in Greece was... I
                        mean, I've never seen anything so infectious within the Greeks and the
                        Greek-Americans as this hatred of the Turks. It's unreasonable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And the Turks have, or had, no concept of lobbying. They also had very
                    little, they still have very little concept of discussion. Turks don't talk
                    about things; they want it their way or not at all. They're not good at
                    bargaining or at discussing things. I had a Turkish roommate. They're great at
                    some things, but discussion, being open minded, thinking of other people's
                    position, or acknowledging problems in their country's history are not strong
                    points.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm still interviewing David Jones, who was involved in a
                        series of things dealing with both, and he said although the Greeks seem to
                        be giving us a rougher time, you can usually eventually get something from
                        the Greeks, but the Turks sort of have a position and it stays that
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It stays that way, and you cannot talk them out of it, and eventually
                    it becomes solidified, and they make a law saying you cannot talk about it. I
                    remember when I was in Turkey you had the Lebanese civil war sort of raging on
                    and on and on. And at the time, a lot of the major banks and financial
                    institutions that were based in Beirut talked about coming to Istanbul or Ankara
                    as their base of operations. They wanted a country that was Muslim because they
                    wanted to continue handling the Arab money. They were interested in Turkey for
                    lots and lots of reasons. They thought of Istanbul as being cosmopolitan. And
                    they started making all sorts of approaches, not only to us but through us and
                    to the various Turkish ministries. They were met with a total stone wall. The
                    Turks would not allow them to open up hard currency exchange accounts; they
                    wouldn't allow them telephone lines. They basically were totally uninterested
                    and, more than uninterested, made them feel unwelcome. And these were major
                    banking concerns, major financial institutions. I remember talking once to
                    somebody in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this and saying, “Hey, if you
                    allow these people to come in, you will become the financial center of the
                    Middle East. You will also get a lot of spin-off development money for things in
                    Turkey because when they come here and have the money for development and
                    investment, they're going to look at projects in the area, right around their
                    eyes.” And the answer was, “We don't want foreign investment or foreign goods
                    like that in Turkey.” Period. Click. And they never got them; they went to
                    Greece. But they wanted to go to Turkey first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Turkish-American relationship? In a
                        way, you were kind of a fly on the wall, being the ambassador's
                        assistant.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador was quite popular there. We had a number of incidents
                    there that were unpopular. Well, the Turks liked, number one, the fact that
                    Kissinger was there several times, that Haig seemed to be living there at
                    certain times - I mean he was there so often. There was a very active, in
                    Ankara, Turkish-American friendship sort of society going, and it involved a lot
                    of husbands, wives, etc., very active, very pleasant. There was nothing
                    anti-American as such. The Turks never blamed the embassy for the problems. They
                    never really blamed individual Americans in Turkey for the problem. In fact, it
                    was always a bit strange to me that when the Greeks reacted by burning down our
                    embassy in Cyprus and assassinating our ambassador and his secretary the answer
                    was more anti-Turkish tirades in Congress and almost nothing against the Greeks.
                    The Turks couldn't understand that either. We never had a problem at the embassy
                    . There were no demonstrations, no anti-American protests, no marches against
                    the building, nothing like that. To me at least, there was almost no effect at
                    all. I certainly had lots of Turkish friends, including a lot of official
                    friends, Turkish diplomats, Turkish military friends. The social life just kept
                    on; it never changed. There was no policy of freezing us out or anything
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, there have been periods - the '74 to '76 period
                        - where there have been extreme leftist groups, “Gray Wolves” or other
                        things, but essentially terrorist groups which were anti-foreign,
                        particularly anti-American. Were they around at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm trying to think if we had anything at all at the embassy. I don't
                    recall anything. There was some stuff, I think a couple of bombs were probably
                    thrown at the Merhaba Palas, which was the military temporary housing in Ankara.
                    Bombs would go off occasionally against Turkish targets, too. Other than that,
                    probably if you talked to somebody who was in the military there at the time,
                    they might give you a different story about Turkish feelings. I didn't see it
                    myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your Turkish friends about
                        Turkish-American relations and also whither Turkey at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Turkish-American friends - nothing at all. A lot of my Turkish friends
                    were married to Brits or Americans. Other friends were just straight Turkish,
                    with very Turkish lives but nothing at all that was anti-American that I can
                    recall. It never affected my travels in the country, going to people's homes,
                    doing this, doing that. There was no real... I'm starting to speak in Turkish
                    now. The words are coming out in Turkish in my mind. I'm translating back into
                    English. There was no real impact on me, anyway. Whether other people felt there
                    was on their lives I don't know. On my life there wasn't.</p>

                    top level in the Turkish Government has been the same since I was in the Peace
                    Corps there. In the year 1968, I used to sit at little outdoor caf� where they
                    sold biscuits and pastry in the morning, where you could have tea. I used to go
                    there every morning for breakfast, and I would see the prime minister pass by
                    because his house was near there. He'd be walking down to his office, and every
                    morning for about two years he would pass me by and say good morning in English
                    to me because he knew I was an American, and I would say “Good morning, Mr.
                    Prime Minister.” I would continue drinking my tea, and he would pass by. That
                    was Demirel, who was prime minister forever, and then president. He's still a
                    major force in Turkish politics in the year 2000, and I'm talking 1968! His
                    successor was Ecevit, and it was Demirel-Ecevit-Demirel-Ecevit-Demirel-Ecevit -
                    I really don't see much difference between the two. I think probably when they
                    were a lot younger there was, but is there much of a difference? Probably not
                    really. There aren't that many names in Turkish politics. It's not like there is
                    a clear-cut choice. There have been times when the government has got more
                    conservative, but were people dissatisfied with the government? Well, I had a
                    lot of Kurdish friends - they sure were. They weren't dissatisfied with the
                    government so much as they were dissatisfied with Turkish Turks. But even they
                    were often intermarried. Open dissatisfaction? No. Hatred of the government? No.
                    Was there in Turkey such a thing? Yes, absolutely, and a lot of people went to
                    jail or got killed fighting for a different type of government there. Did I know
                    them? No. The embassy in Ankara has been traditionally or was traditionally even
                    less professional about dealing with the opposition than the one in Teheran
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm not sure, but I think that traditionally our embassy in Ankara has
                    basically just toed whatever line the Turkish Government has wanted it to as far
                    as internal developments go. If the Turkish Government said that so-and-so was a
                    terrorist, the embassy parrots it back. The embassy has been so silent on the
                    subject of the Kurdish genocide there that it's extremely dishonest, I would
                    say. It's been extraordinarily unprofessional through a succession of
                    ambassadors. It's sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an issue among the junior officers at all at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Kurds didn't exist. They did not exist because the Turkish Government
                    told us they didn't exist.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Mountain Turks, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like in Israel, Golda Meir used to say there's no
                        such thing as the Palestinian. We get caught on these things. Well, you were
                        with the ambassador through his moods for a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was more than a year. I saw him do things that would not even have
                    been believable in the best of comedy fiction.</p>
                <p>This ambassador is the only one, I think, who's ever had the balls to tell
                    Kissinger that somebody who was coming in Kissinger's party was not welcome in
                    Turkey. And he did this. He refused to let one of Kissinger's guards in because
                    he didn't like the guy. And Kissinger accepted this. I saw him do this
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>Other stories about him. Well, the ambassador was... he liked dogs. Saying he
                    liked dogs is not enough. He had a fetish about dogs. He loved dogs. He loved
                    street dogs, and whenever he saw a dog on the street in Ankara he would stop and
                    pick it up and then he would carry it home. He turned the entire garage there -
                    it was a three- or four-bay garage - into a kennel, blocked it off, and had only
                    dogs in there. At one point he was up to 26, I think. I tried to count them.
                    These were street dogs. Well, one of his best tricks was he'd show movies on
                    Saturdays. He had a little theater in the residence. And new people who arrived
                    in Ankara were always invited. Any of the American families, especially the
                    military families, would come up to the ambassador's residence and see these old
                    reel-to-reel movies. And what he would do would be to disappear from the movie
                    while everybody was engrossed in it with little Timmy and little Jimmy and
                    little Jamie or little Mary Ann, and at the end of the movie, the kids would
                    come back and say, “Mommy, Mommy, look what the ambassador gave me - a puppy.!”
                    That's how he'd get rid of the puppies. Everybody knew about this, and nobody
                    would tell the newcomers because everybody else had gotten screwed.</p>
                <p>He had two dogs himself. One of them was Benjamin, and the other was called
                    Tripod by everybody because he only had three legs and would do a sort of
                    peg-leg routine across the floor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, in a Muslim country dogs are not -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They are considered unclean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They were considered very unclean in Turkey. Two more stories about
                    dogs. The July 4th reception at the ambassador's residence, my last one there, I
                    had been in the back sort of dealing with people down in the back garden, and a
                    Turkish general saw me and walked over. He had just come out of the residence,
                    and he walked up to me and said, “Michael, you must tell your ambassador
                    something. I have just been introduced to his dog, and he made me shake its
                    paw.” He said, “He is making all of the Turkish guests shake his dog's paw.
                    Please go and tell him that we do not think dogs are clean animals.”</p>
                <p>Well, that was one. The other one was my first winter as staff aide. We had just
                    gotten him off to the United States. Because of his CENTO responsibilities, his
                    NATO responsibility, the Cyprus War and other things, the arms problems, he was
                    in the United States quite frequently. We had gotten him off, and the phone
                    rang. The phone rang in his office, and it was for me. The office configuration
                    was such that the three secretaries, the DCM's and the ambassador's two
                    secretaries sat in one room. To the right was the DCM's office; to the left was
                    a waiting room for the ambassador's office, and then the ambassador's suite. If
                    you stood in the waiting room, you had a line of sight for all three offices.
                    They had big doors opening from one to the other. The phone rang, someone said,
                    “Michael, it's the ambassador, he wants to talk to you.” I picked up the phone
                    from one of the secretary's desks. The DCM's secretary and the ambassador's two
                    secretaries also picked up phones, and I could see the DCM pick up the phone,
                    too. We were all protecting each other. The ambassador said, “Michael, I forgot
                    to tell you something when you dropped me off at the airport yesterday.” He
                    said, “There's a dog, a big black bitch up at the officer's club, and it's going
                    to have a litter of puppies.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “I want you to take her
                    and take her back to the residence and tell Phyllis I said it was okay, because
                    I don't want her to have her puppies in the cold weather. I want her to have her
                    babies in the residence.” I said, “Okay.” And he said, “Oh, and by the way,” he
                    said, “take the father, too.” And I said, “The father?” And he said, “Yes, the
                    father.” I said, “How will I know the father, Mr. Ambassador?” He said, “Oh,
                    it's a really big dog; it's one that walks with a limp and it has this big brown
                    think on its nose.” I said, “Okay, I'll take it up.” Fine, fine. Well, when he
                    said, “take the father,” I had taken the phone away, and I was staring at it in
                    my hand, thinking I hadn't heard him correctly. I looked up. All three
                    secretaries and the DCM had their phones away from their faces and were staring
                    at the phones. It was like the only reaction. We put the phones down, and the
                    DCM walked over and he said, “I wonder how he knows it was the father. Do you
                    think he stood there and watched them doin' it?” But I'm not going to go and get
                    pregnant dogs and stray street dogs myself. What do I know about dogs? I got the
                    local army vet from the army base, and he and I and his helpers went out in a
                    military vehicle with a big dog box and got the dogs, took them back to the
                    residence. And his wife's face, when I told her that the ambassador had said
                    that he wanted her to have the puppies right there with the father watching - it
                    was... an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a very interesting time. Did you get
                        any feel for how Macomber dealt with the president, the prime minister and
                        all? Were relationships strained?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, the relationship was not strained at all. The relationship, in
                    fact, between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassy was
                    extraordinarily good. The minister's special assistant and his two secretaries
                    were three of my closest friends there. I'm still in touch with them even after
                    all these years. We did everything together. We were good friends. The
                    minister's special assistant and I lived less than a block apart. We were
                    together a lot and became good friends. But the ambassador was so energetic, and
                    he had such an open, engaging personality when dealing face to face with
                    officials or face to face with anyone who didn't work for him, that he was
                    excellent at that, and they liked him and he had a good reputation. It's only
                    when you worked for him that he would blow hot and cold, hot and cold, hot and
                    cold. Turks liked him in general. They thought he was extremely strange, but he
                    appealed to them somehow. I think he was quite effective. He would call them up
                    at one o'clock in the morning. He was on top of everything to do with the
                    political relationship and very actively on top of it all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have though that we had a real bone to pick with
                        Congress at this particular time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador, I think, was supportive of Congress. He loved visitors.
                    He would encourage people to visit him, and every time a congressman came
                    through, the congressman was treated like visiting princes. I've seen embassies
                    where congressional visits are handled, but just handled and that's all.
                    Macomber went out of his way to handle them well - full-court press. I thing
                    that as much as anything helped Turkey. It would also encourage to the Turks to
                    do something. And the Turks understood this, probably. They had a story to tell.
                    They wanted us to accept their version as the only possible version, but they
                    would still deal hospitably with visiting congressmen. And they understood
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, in '75, you got out of that hot spot, and
                        where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I started to hate the job because I never had any time off, and I mean
                    literally no time off - no Sundays, no Saturdays. I was there every evening. And
                    my social life was more and more just going to his receptions and going to his
                    dinners, working through them. And I was getting only a couple of hours of sleep
                    a night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had other staff aides been married? Because I would think
                        that this would -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't know. My predecessor had not been. But I'd only wanted it for
                    two weeks, and I was the only staff aide that I knew. And the ambassador seemed
                    to be quite content with me. I talked to the DCM about the possibility of
                    changing because it was slowly driving me crazy, and he said, “If you want to
                    change, you're going to have to get out of it yourself, but you don't want to
                    just quit and, you know, leave the job.” He said, “You have to find a way to get
                    somebody else into it and get yourself out of it.” But I did. I did a campaign -
                    it took me about two months - and part of the campaign was letting my hair grow
                    very long. It was that time in the Foreign Service when it was becoming unclear
                    what you could or could not say about hair. I let my hair grow right to my
                    shoulders. I started smoking. I hadn't been smoking in a number of years. I
                    decided it was worth it. I knew the ambassador hated smoking, disliked people
                    who smoked around him, but also knew that he'd never say anything about this
                    because in 1975 you could not say anything about people smoking. He had a box of
                    cigarettes that he kept on his coffee table for Turkish guests and other guests.
                    I started taking cigarettes from the box and smoking them in front of them, if
                    he had guests that I was taking notes for, something like that. He would look at
                    me, but he never said anything. I then started really building up another junior
                    officer at the post who I decided was my best possibility of a replacement. I
                    was sort of Byzantine in my approach. I kept dropping things about what a great
                    social life it was, the ambassador's receptions and dinner and this and that and
                    Princess that and the Hohenzollerns coming through, you know, and Rockefellers
                    and others. This guy was a GSO. He was a great officer, but he was a GSO, so he
                    never went anywhere. No one ever invites the GSO to anything, and his wife was
                    starting to feel this, and I would just keep talking about the wonderful social
                    life you have as a staff aide, always with the ambassador and the generals and
                    the this and the that. I wanted his wife to push him for it. And then
                    anything... because I had control of what the ambassador read, I made sure that
                    for about a month anything at all that had been done by this guy the GSO I would
                    underline with comments like “He did a great job on this. He really pulled the
                    chestnuts out of the fire on this one. So-and-so's really good.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the most disgusting story I've ever heard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Sorry, but I was desperate to get out of the job. I had no life. I had
                    no life at all. I worked on the guy's wife, I worked on the guy. I did
                    everything I could. I kept building up... I built up his reputation to a fever
                    pitch in the office, and then, thank God, a telegram came through. It was Martin
                    Hertz talking about staff aides. Martin Hertz - God rest his soul - used to love
                    to pontificate about the Foreign Service and the philosophy of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew him in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Nice guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Really liked to pontificate. And he had written a telegram about the
                    care and feeding of staff aides, and the best length of time to have a staff
                    aide and what their duties should be, etc. Well, this was not normally something
                    I'd waste the ambassador's time with, but I carefully and judiciously underlined
                    it and had it in the ambassador's traffic one particular day; and very late one
                    night, as the DCM, the ambassador, and I were sitting there going through the
                    day's events and the traffic and everything else, the ambassador pulled it out
                    and asked the DCM if he had seen it, and my ears, of course, were right up to
                    the ceiling at this point. And the ambassador said, “It says here that no one
                    should be a staff aide longer than four or five months. I've never had one for
                    that long. The maximum is about three months you should have one for.” And the
                    DCM looked at me and said, “Michael, how long have you been staff aide now?” And
                    I said, “It's going on 13 months.” I said, “We passed the year a couple of weeks
                    ago.” The ambassador said, “Has it been that long? You've been here more than
                    three months?” And the next day, it worked. I was GSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And thank God. My blood pressure came down, my weight dropped, I
                    stopped smoking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a haircut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I cut my hair. Everything was wonderful then. And I was able to start
                    using Turkish again. Sitting in an office surrounded by Turkish FSNs, it was
                    great - because I never used it in the ambassador's office. No one ever used it.
                    We had to deal in English all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk a bit about what does a GSO do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: GSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It means General Services Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>METRINKO: My specific job was I was the customs and transportation officer. I was
                    responsible for immediate supervision of the motor pool, dispatcher, other
                    drivers, the cars; and as customs officer I was responsible for the pouches and
                    shipments of household effects, all official shipments that came in and out of
                    the embassy. And this also involved AID and also involved in a general way
                    military shipments that came in for people assigned to the base. I had to
                    supervise the staff of guys and the work and also the travel office too. We
                    arranged for shipments of the non-classified diplomatic pouches and also of all
                    personal effects and all air freight. I found it very interesting. I was still,
                    by the way, this whole time, a vice-consul, so I was also doing consular worked
                    for the consular officer whenever she was away. As GSO I supervised the travel
                    arrangements. We had a travel girl, an FSN, who made all travel arrangements,
                    private and official, for people assigned to the embassy. She worked for me. The
                    16, I think it was, drivers worked for me. Also, I was responsible for the
                    maintenance of the motor vehicle pool. Now I didn't even own a car. I had never
                    owned one at that point. And suddenly I'm responsible for a whole fleet of
                    clunkers, including the ambassador's extraordinarily heavy, uncomfortably
                    falling apart stretch limo with full armor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the period when we had this big limos
                        underpowered - I mean, our limousines were far underpowered all over the
                        world, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: All over the world they were heavily armored and they hadn't been built
                    to take an extra thousand or so pounds of iron. These were the ones where the
                    windows could not be opened or closed because they had Plexiglas on the outsides
                    or they had Plexiglas-Mylar, I think it was called, on the front windshield so
                    that if you were a driver and had to drive this for more than 10 minutes you
                    started to get headaches because of the refracted light. They were
                    uncomfortable, and basically if they had ever been attacked or gotten into an
                    accident, they would have been real sweat boxes in which you would have died.
                    And the tires on them, the extra-heavy tires, if you went over a certain number
                    of miles per hour, they would bust. They were impossible, and yet they were
                    required. We had one of those real clunkers that was breaking down all the time.
                    The fact that the ambassador liked to tool around at high speeds did not lend
                    itself to keeping the vehicles in good condition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the GSO often you can end up by being in the unenviable
                        position of being responsible for who gets what.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I didn't do furniture, and I didn't do housing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, that's like that saying, “I don't do windows,”
                        because that's where the GSO becomes the most unpopular person in the
                        embassy, by -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>METRINKO: - holding back or giving forth to the wrong people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, what I did - my life with the motor vehicles didn't really affect
                    people. It was to get people efficiently from one place to another. We had a
                    very good dispatcher, who normally handled things quite well. He only came to me
                    when it was a big problem or when he needed something or had to go over
                    resources. The drivers, I knew every one of the drivers, spoke Turkish to them
                    all the time, so I had no problem with them. The household effects were a
                    problem because household effects were always delayed. Air freight was always
                    delayed. It was a country that was always full of red tape, especially for the
                    shipment and movement of property. Problems in the office... Well, three men who
                    worked with me, three local employees, were under indictment for smuggling
                    through the diplomatic pouch, and once a month had to go down to the local court
                    and have their hearing postponed for another month. They'd been accused of
                    smuggling watch parts from Germany into Turkey using the American diplomatic
                    pouch. Because they had not yet been found guilty, they were still all at work.
                    As it turned out, the charges were dropped about a year after they had started
                    this process, but once a month they would stand up and say, “Well, Mr. Michael,
                    it is time for us to go to court again.” And that was happening. I got to see
                    the bad side of a lot of American employees, the things that they would try to
                    smuggle into Turkey or take out of Turkey that were forbidden or breaking
                    Turkish laws - people who would look at you and say, “No, I have no weapons. I
                    have never owned a weapon.” And you would discover they had a collection of
                    high-powered hunting rifles they were bringing into Turkey, probably to sell.
                    Things like that happened far more than once. I was responsible for motor
                    vehicle sales, and at the time there was a regulation- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>If you sold your privately owned vehicle for a profit, more than you had paid for
                    it, you were required to either turn the profit over to a local charity approved
                    by the embassy or to return it to the federal government. In the course of my
                    one year as GSO seeing 30 or 40 car sales, I only saw one person who admitted to
                    getting a profit on his car, and when he came in it had been so long in the
                    history of the office since anyone had declared a profit that no one knew what
                    to do. It was literally that long. For years and years everyone had said, No, I
                    did not make a profit, no, I did not make a profit. It was an interesting time
                    because the admin counselor at the time was a very nice man. He came to me
                    shortly after I became GSO and said, “Michael, you have a lot of Turkish
                    friends. I know that you have Turkish friends over at your house. We have a huge
                    representational budget for the admin section. My wife and I prefer not to have
                    any Turks in our house.” He said, “You know, [So-and-So] the GSO doesn't really
                    want to have any Turks in his house, either. [So-and-So] isn't really interested
                    in entertaining. On the other hand, we have to entertain, because you know what
                    the ambassador is like. He wants us to spend all of this money.” He said, “Why
                    don't you use all of the representational budget. Just send me the list of your
                    guests. Try and make it look like they're good for the section, and you can use
                    the whole representational budget for the year.” So I did.</p>

                <p>Q: I would think this would give you plenty of license to go after customs people
                    and -</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Everything. And I had Turkish friends, luckily, who were, many of them,
                    officials. It was great. So in my second year as a junior officer I had
                    representation, a major post's entire section. I had lots of good parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after sort of getting out of that - you didn't have
                        to deal with dogs any more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No dogs any more, thank God. That was the staff aide's job - the dog
                    aide's job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used to call the staff aides “dogsbodies,” which was
                        really -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There was probably a reason for that. No more dogs. Basically, I was
                    able to have a social life. I was able to go to dinners. I could show up at the
                    time I said I'd be coming. I had a very pleasant second year in the embassy. And
                    the ambassador would even occasionally remember my name when he saw me. It was
                    fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1976 you were ready to go out. Where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ready to go out. Well, I really wanted to go back to Iran. I had been
                    there on a brief vacation for about a week. I wanted to go back and serve there
                    in the embassy. I got in touch with my career counselor, and I was told that
                    because it was so popular there would be nothing available in Iran for the next
                    couple of years, forget about Iran - nothing, nothing, nothing there - and to
                    look at other places, at which point a telegram arrived requesting volunteers
                    for Beirut, which was in the throes of its civil war. But the last part of the
                    telegram said that anyone who volunteers for Beirut and spends two years there
                    at the embassy will be given his or her first choice of an onward assignment.
                    And I thought, Great, this is the way I can get back to Iran. So I volunteered
                    for Beirut, and I was accepted, and all that was fine. I got telegrams from the
                    State Department telling me where to put my household effects. They were all
                    supposed to go to ELSO for storage. I was supposed to get, I think, 90 pounds of
                    air freight only, and that was going to go directly to Beirut. I had that
                    prepared and set to go. But that wasn't supposed to go until I was actually on
                    my way to post. I was given three weeks of home leave, and that was fine. I came
                    back straight from Ankara to Washington and went to the Department. I came here
                    because I wanted to see a brother. I went to the Department the first day that I
                    was back, saw someone I knew in the hallway who said, “Ah, Michael, I'm sorry to
                    see that your assignment to Qatar has been broken.” I said, “I'm not going to
                    Qatar; I'm going to Beirut.” He said, “No, that was broken about a month ago,
                    and you were reassigned to Qatar. But that one's broken now, too.” “What?”</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Well, as it turned out, the personnel system had been somehow dealing with two
                    completely different sets of instructions about me. The Beirut assignment had
                    been broken because the embassy had been taken out of Beirut. There was no more
                    embassy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moved to Cyprus, essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Moved to Cyprus, and also to Damascus. Consular went to Damascus. And
                    people assigned to the Consular Section, their assignments were broken. I went
                    up to see the career counselor. Someone else was doing career assignments who
                    told me, yes, come up and see me, fine. I went up, and they started, Well, you
                    know, the story about Beirut, etc., gee, it was a shame, you should have gotten
                    a telegraph. All this was going on, and he said, “Look, we have an assignment
                    we're trying very hard to get people for. It's going to be as challenging as
                    Beirut would have been, very interesting. We could really use someone there.” I
                    said, “Where?” He said, “Have you ever thought about going to Teheran?” And, you
                    know, it was like totally bizarre. Someone else in the same office two months
                    before had told me nothing available, nothing would be, too popular, etc. And
                    here they were trying to sweeten the pot to get me to Teheran. And, they said,
                    via a TDY in Damascus for six months - great, best of all worlds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I arrived in Damascus in November of 1976, and I was there until March
                    of 1977.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Straight visa work. I was the NIV officer. It's a good post. I had been
                    accustomed in Ankara to dealing with four to five visa applications a day. There
                    was very little consular work in Ankara. Most of the consular work was in
                    Istanbul. When I got to Damascus, I did straight visa work. There were two
                    American officers in the section. It was a nice section, very pleasant, and we
                    had the Beirut files there, at least part of them. People from Lebanon would
                    come to Damascus for visas. We also dealt with the Syrians. We were doing, I
                    guess, oh, between 70 to 90 applicants a day, which at first I was horrified at
                    and then found I could do quite easily in the morning and process the paperwork
                    in the afternoon. I had a very good time. It was a job that started in the
                    morning, ended in the evening. The embassy was hospitable. It was an extremely
                    professional embassy.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador was Richard Murphy. The DCM was Bob Pelletreau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Two Middle Eastern hands, two of the best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two of the top people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were a great team. They were extremely professional. They were
                    friendly. They were both hospitable. I'm trying to think. There were other
                    people in the embassy - good Lord, Jim Cooper was the political counselor,
                    again, very good. Jim Budeit was my boss temporarily, and then Seton Stapleton,
                    again, especially Seton, very competent, professional officers. We had a good
                    time. I met Americans who were there. I met an American friend who was doing a
                    Fulbright study of the archeology of Damascus. We got along very, very well, and
                    he introduced me to some other budding young archeologists, and I had some
                    Syrian friends, actually, young ones, and also met a couple of Hungarians who
                    were there doing Arabic studies, and had a great time. Many weekends, with a
                    couple of this group, either one of the Dutch archeologists or the American or
                    the Hungarians, I would change my clothes in the embassy on a Friday afternoon,
                    leave my suit there, put my jeans on, and go hitchhiking around the country for
                    the weekend. I hitchhiked all over Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought Syrian secret police would have been
                        all over you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Interesting thing about Syria. We were just reopening Syria. We had
                    reopened there in, I think, '74 or '75. I got there a year later. The Syrians
                    were actually very pleasant. They had been very anti-American during the '67-73
                    period, but the Syrians are correct. I mean, they're correct in the sense of
                    their behavior. There was no outward harassment at all. The people of Syria...
                    There were no tourists in Syria at that point, nothing at all. People simply
                    didn't come there, and this meant that you were welcomed if you were a tourist.
                    The normal Syrian didn't really know very much about the United States, and
                    instead of loving us or hating us, the general reaction was, “Oh, you're an
                    American - that's nice.” There was no emotion about it. I found that very
                    pleasant. I had a good time, saw the entire country. I was in the towns, the
                    villages, overnight in Arab houses and other things. I could do this on
                    weekends, come back, have a normal embassy life. And actually, the RSO once, I
                    said -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regional Security Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I asked him, what would his reaction be if I told him that the
                    vice-consul was out hitchhiking with Hungarians who were there on Communist
                    Party scholarships and going out with local Syrians and hitchhiking around the
                    country and basically coming back to the embassy on Monday morning to start work
                    again? And he would say, “I would prefer that he didn't tell me. I had a great
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any of the mood from people you were
                        talking to about how they felt about Assad and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, Syrians did not discuss politics with me. I had a great social
                    life, but kept it off politics there. And I didn't know enough about that
                    situation. I had very basic Arabic. I spoke a lot of Turkish and Persian,
                    especially in the embassy, where so many people were Armenian and spoke Turkish,
                    but didn't really touch on politics. Somehow, you know, I liked Syria, but it
                    never affected me deeply. It was a pleasant place for six months. I had a great
                    social life, a lot of young people in the embassy and a lot of young people
                    outside the embassy. I had no ties to the place. I was not trying to live there.
                    I knew it was going to be a six-month assignment, and it was absolutely
                    great.</p>
                <p>

                        we'll pick it up the next time at 1977, when you're off to Iran, which
                        sounds like a very nice pleasant kind of assignment.</hi>

                <p>Today is May 31, 2000. Mike, so 1977. You're off to Iran. I think you talked
                    about how you got the job, didn't you?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, I got the job because the personnel system made a mistake. I think
                    I did talk about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you did. So well then, when you arrived in 19. . .
                        Did you get any briefing or anything else at all.</hi>

                <p>METRINKO: About Iran?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I never had area studies either. Of course, I didn't really need
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean were you picking up anything in the corridors about
                        the situation there, whither Iran and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was a lowly untenured officer going off to the visa section in
                    Teheran. It's not likely that anybody would even have spoken to me. The did not
                    give briefings in those days to untenured junior visa officers. I went to Iran.
                    I wanted to go there because I'd liked the country so much in the Peace Corps, I
                    had lots of friends there, thought I could have a good interesting time there.
                    And also thought that I could be a pretty decent officer since I spoke the
                    language, spoke two of the languages of the country, and knew a lot about the
                    country. I arrived in Teheran in March of 1977 and was assigned to the visa
                    section as a visa officer. It was a very different kind of consular work than I
                    had done in Syria, certainly very different from my rather gentlemanly approach
                    to consular work in Ankara. Teheran was almost a factory type visa situation, a
                    “visa mill,” with many, many hundreds of Iranians every morning lining up to get
                    into the visa section. I think we got to 900-1000 on many days, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Everybody. We had a huge military exchange program with Iran, so
                    Iranians were being sent off to the United States for training. Iranians had now
                    gotten access to oil money. They were getting scholarships, fellowships from the
                    Government of Iran, and their own families had the money to send them off to
                    school in the United States. The Iranian school system could not handle the
                    population of graduated high school seniors, and for each person who went you
                    had a mother, a father, a brother, or a sister who wanted to visit. So we were
                    up in the high thousands of visa applicants every year. And getting deluged by
                    it. Needless to say, the Department had not kept up with the anticipated demand.
                    There were very few consular officers at the post - very few State officers.
                    There were a couple of Agency officers who were also assigned to the visa
                    section. But I was one of, I think, three regular State officers assigned to the
                    visa section, and for the first several months, from March until I think July or
                    so, I worked in the visa section. It was an interesting job. It caused me some
                    problems. I saw one side of the Foreign Service that I thought was rather sad. I
                    got involved in a fraud investigation of my own boss at the time, and she was
                    moved out of the section because of the implications of fraud in her
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? I mean, I'm trying to figure out how the
                        Department in those days dealt with -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Handle it? Cases like this - I won't use names - but what happened is
                    shortly after I arrived in the section I was introduced to the Consular Section
                    “expediter” (quote-unquote), who worked out at the airport and basically helped
                    people from the embassy process through the airport. He would come in every day
                    with several up to a stack of passports and request visas for various people and
                    claim they were all given to him by the head of the airport, the head of
                    security at the airport, or various important people for us at the airport. We
                    were under orders to process these as quickly as possible because it was
                    important for the embassy, orders directly from the head of the visa section.
                    That was fine. I didn't like the expediter. None of us did, among the American
                    officers who were doing visa work, but we were told basically to do whatever he
                    told us to do on visas because his position was so important for the embassy.
                    One day, several weeks after this, he had brought in a stack of passports. He
                    left them with the secretary in the visa section. She came to me a little while
                    later and said some of these passports, the applications aren't filled out. I
                    looked at one, and there was nothing on it to allow me to determine what sort of
                    visa the applicant should get - no purpose of visit to the United States,
                    nothing at all on that. So I asked her who he had said had recommended the visa
                    applicant, and the secretary said he said it was the head of the airport, and I
                    said, “Call the head of the airport, tell his secretary we have to get in touch
                    with this applicant because the we have to ask the applicant a few questions.”
                    My secretary came back five minutes later and said, “I just got off the phone
                    with the head of the airport himself, and he told me that he has never met Mr.
                    Barrimi, the expediter, he doesn't care to meet him, he doesn't know anybody who
                    works for the American Embassy, and he has never in his career sent passports to
                    the American Embassy to request visas for anyone else.” Well, I wrote this up
                    and marched in quite proudly to the head of the visa section, who reacted with
                    almost a fit of rage and how dare I question this guy. He was doing a rough job
                    for the embassy, I should never have called the airport up, I should never have
                    bothered her about this, and from now on she wanted all the passports directly
                    to her and she would take care of the visas. As soon as the workday was over, I
                    went over and talked to the Security Office, told the RSO what had happened. He
                    asked me and another American officer to start photocopying all the visa
                    applications now being signed by our boss. Within a couple of days he had enough
                    ammunition. He had called in the visa applicants who were getting these visas,
                    interviewed them, discovered a whole range of people paying money to get their
                    visas. Well, the RSO summoned the head of the visa section over, and apparently
                    she refused to cooperate. She was removed from the position immediately and put
                    upstairs doing projects, but she stayed there for another couple of months. And
                    the FSN who had been doing this was fired. I was given her job as an untenured
                    officer. That was fine. I was there for about a month, a month and a half, doing
                    that work when quite by, again, personnel and bureaucratic chance, the position
                    of head of the consulate in Tabriz opened up. The person who was there already
                    got an assignment. He was leaving to go to another city in Iran as principal
                    officer, and Tabriz required a principal officer. They looked at me and asked me
                    if I'd be interested in going out there since I spoke Turkish and Persian, and I
                    agreed. And off I went to Tabriz.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk first about when you arrived in '77 in
                        Teheran. What was the political situation like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Political situation, do you mean inside the embassy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, the political situation outside.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The political situation outside the embassy depended upon who was
                    looking at it. If you were the ambassador, if you were the ambassador's
                    Political Section, if you were the DCM, everything was bright and rosy. If you
                    had any contact with the people of Iran, it was not so bright and rosy. In fact,
                    it was bloody awful, but since so few people over in the front office or the
                    Political Section or the Econ Section of the embassy spoke Persian, and since
                    they had such limited contact with normal Iranians, they didn't seem to realize
                    this. I'll give you and example. Shortly after I got there, I started getting in
                    touch with my old friends, and in the course of a few weeks I saw an old student
                    of mine who had become a police officer, and he was also on the escort for the
                    Shah. His roommate was one of the Shahs “Immortal Guards,” one of the Shah's
                    personal bodyguards. That was one. I got in touch with the former head of my
                    school. I had been a teacher just outside of Teheran, and the president of the
                    school invited me out for dinner one night, and we had a nice long talk about
                    the situation. And the third one was a visa applicant who had come in requesting
                    a visa and claiming he wanted to go to the United States so that he could
                    dispose of his art collection.</p>
                <p>The three cases are interesting. The police officer, who was a member of the
                    establishment, closely tied to the Shah's entourage, security, the first night
                    that we met and many, many times thereafter, gave me a large number of anecdotes
                    about how people disliked the Shah, how he disliked the Shah, how there was a
                    tremendous rift in security services that were supposed to be protecting the
                    Shah, how some of the police had an agreement with leftists, opponents of the
                    Shah, to not interfere with each other, basically a hands-off policy one from
                    the other, and how, as he said, “I wouldn't kill the Shah myself, but if I saw
                    somebody else pulling the trigger, I would turn and look in the other
                    direction.” That's coming from one of the Shah's guards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why this animosity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In his case, the great disparity in money in the country, the way most
                    of the people lived, the 95 per cent at the bottom and the 5 per cent at the
                    top. The number of people around the Shah who were deeply corrupt, basically
                    thieves, and he could see this all day long with his own eyes during his
                    professional duties - the bribery, the corruption, the attitude towards Iran,
                    towards other Iranians by the shah's entourage, by the court - that was his
                    reason.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In the case of the university president, it's very interesting. I started to talk
                    to him... The president had both known a student of mine quite well when I was
                    in the Peace Corps. And I had asked about this student when I came back, when I
                    saw some of her fellow students, and had been told she had gone to the United
                    States, that she had gotten a fellowship from the school and was off to the
                    States getting a doctorate, and that they had heard this from her family. That's
                    fine. This particular student had had a great deal of political trouble when she
                    was a student. She had been arrested. I had seen her getting out of jail when I
                    was a teacher there. She was a very bright, very personable student too, which
                    was why she attracted attention. Great girl. I congratulated the president of
                    the school and just said, “Hey, by the way, you know, it was great, I'm glad you
                    gave a fellowship to [So-and-so] and that she's in the States studying now.” He
                    looked at me and said, “She doesn't have a fellowship. She'd dead.” “What do you
                    mean, 'She's dead'?” He said, “She was executed in prison.” Her family tells
                    people she has a fellowship because they're afraid to let it be known that their
                    daughter has been executed.”</p>
                <p>Well, I wrote both memos up. The third memo I wrote up was about the visa
                    applicant who, as it turned out, had a great collection of primitive Iranian
                    art, old Iranian religious art, and when he showed me pictures of it during his
                    interview and told me that the Shah's wife and folks from the court would come
                    to look at it and they would send important dignitaries in to see it in his
                    home, I asked him if I could see it some day when he returned from America. He
                    agreed, that was fine. Why was he going to America? He said, “There is so much
                    trouble happening here, so much is brewing here, I see it around me and I see it
                    in the court, and I see it with my rich friends, that I think the country is
                    heading for a major collapse. This collection of mine is my baby. It's my child.
                    I've been doing this my whole life. I don't want it destroyed. I'm going to
                    America to try and find a museum I can present it to.” I wrote that up.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Now, I wrote all three memos in longhand because I didn't have access to a
                    classified typewriter. This was back in the old days when you had to type... And
                    I gave them all to the ambassador's staff aide who was going to find a typist
                    for me, and that was fine. I had written them all up, and they were all in fine
                    copy and had all the addressees and everything else on them, and he was just
                    going to get them typed so that I in turn could get them approved by the consul
                    general. Well, that was fine. It didn't think about it because he was gone for a
                    couple of days, and then I got a call, a sort of panicky call, from the main
                    embassy. The chancery building was about two blocks from the consular section.
                    There was very, very little connection between the two. Our work building had no
                    generator, was always surrounded by a mob of visa applicants, American citizens
                    trying to get services, a crowd of people who would sleep out in front of it all
                    night long waiting to get into the early morning line. The embassy was set back.
                    It was on (quote) “a compound.” We were immediately open to the street. But I
                    got a call to get over immediately to the DCM's office about my memos. I was
                    kind of puzzled. I was waiting for them to come to me so I could send them in
                    the clearance process. I called over to the staff aide and discovered that he
                    had given them to a secretary in the admin section to type up. She had assumed
                    they were cleared. She had done them in final, dropped them into the pouch,
                    which had then gone off, you know, addressed to various people in Washington,
                    and had also done copies to go up to the DCM's office and the Political Section,
                    which had gotten the copies of these memos after they had gone into the pouch
                    and the pouch was already en route. The Political Section and the DCM blew up
                    because I was working behind their backs and what right did I have to write
                    these? And why had I done this and why hadn't I gotten it cleared, etc., etc,
                    and who did I think I was, what did I know, and they knew so much better, and
                    all this was stupidity, and what was the name of the member of the Shah's guard
                    who was betraying the Shah with his friends? Well, I refused to give that, of
                    course, because I knew that they would turn his name over to SAVAK and he then
                    would have been killed or put in prison. I wasn't going to do that.</p>
                <p>I had caught holy hell, but as it turned out, the Department reacted in a
                    different way. I had a call from the Department, a private call to me, from an
                    officer on the Iran Desk, who said, “I found your memos fascinating. They're
                    very unlike what we've been getting from the embassy, from the Political
                    Section. I want to know more about this, and would you please continue to write,
                    just send them directly to me, and I will make sure they get seen.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: As it turned out, I was sent off to Tabriz shortly after that, and what
                    I wrote from then on were telegrams that went through the normal clearing
                    procedures. I wasn't about to start to these intrigues now.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were all sitting off by yourself there, but
                        were you able, or did you ever talk to some of the more junior members of
                        the Political Section? Were they shaking? There was this thing that was
                        pretty well known, that it had been made rather firm that we were not to
                        report anything nasty about the Shah and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That was definitely policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this must have gotten under the skin of a lot of
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't know if it ever bothered the political section. I doubt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: George Lambrakis was the counselor. John Stempel was the deputy. I
                    never saw them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The DCM initially was... oh, gosh... You know, I know the name so well,
                    I could picture... No, Miklos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador had just arrived, and that was Ambassador Sullivan. Put
                    it this way. Lambrakis and Stempel changed slowly over the next year and a half.
                    Miklos never changed, and he left a few months later anyway. And the ambassador
                    changed dramatically, but it took about a year and a half, in his views. Now,
                    can I blame them? Then, I did; now, I do not. To send people to a country like
                    Iran without the language, without any real grounding in the society and the
                    culture and the history, without any sense for the feel, the smell, the touch of
                    Iran, and to expect them to somehow become prescient when they are surrounded by
                    high walls and security concerns that prevent their getting into society,
                    prevent their wandering around the country - perhaps that's not fair. I don't
                    know how to overcome that in staffing an embassy. If you have an ambassador
                    who's served in the country as a junior officer or, better yet, served in the
                    country in a non-government capacity, that's great. But if you only have
                    somebody who came up through the system and who was always in a different part
                    of the world and they don't have the language or any of the regular human
                    contact with that society, they are never going to understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And plus the fact that we had a mindset. Some countries
                        you can go in and, you know, who cares? I mean, that's the wrong way, but
                        there's room for you to exercise your judgment and often coming in that way
                        you can be a sort of disinterested observer, but Iran had this mindset.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Iran had a mindset and there was another problem, too. Iran did not
                    have a decent press at the time. The Iranian press in English was amateur. It
                    was high school newspaper quality. You got nothing from the Iranian press. The
                    Iranian academics printed things, but that was also childlike. It was not what
                    you'd call very professional or high level. And we were so imbued with the idea
                    that the opposition were bloody and violent that nobody was going to listen to
                    what they were saying. The Shah had convinced us of this; the SAVAK had
                    convinced us of this. The CIA was convinced of it. Therefore, why would you pay
                    attention to somebody who was basically a barbarian? That's they way they would
                    look at the opposition groups. That being said, the American press, American
                    journalists and American academics, were even far more to blame. They had been
                    suckered into the Shah's system. And one of the most enlightening things that I
                    saw through the revolution was a long list of the American journalists who had
                    been accepting gifts and bribes from the Shah's government. It was great. When
                    you know that a prominent journalist has gotten a large gift from the Shah's
                    government, it has to affect her reporting about events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And it went on and on like that. So was it only the embassy? No,
                    because an ambassador also gets his information not just from his political
                    officers and his consular officers and his economic officers. He gets his
                    information from the milieu and from the press and from the journalists and the
                    academics. If they have all become prostitutes, which in the case of Iran most
                    American journalists and north American academics had become, then you can't
                    blame the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, who was consul general at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The consul general when I arrived there was Ward Christiansen, and he
                    was replaced by Lou Goeltz a few months later. Ward I hardly knew at all. I
                    mean, I knew him - he was good, he was okay. Lou Goeltz was really something
                    great, and I got to know Lou very, very well because he would come up to Tabriz
                    once I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lou replaced me in Seoul, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Lou was a great guy.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very professional. Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, the DCM, by the way, changed. Miklos left in the summer of 1977 -
                    no I guess toward the end of 1977 - and he was replaced by Charlie Naas, who was
                    incredibly open-minded and professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's still stick to Teheran. The group you were around,
                        did they have any reflections of the religious community, the mullahs,
                        Khomeini, and all that, or not, at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Iranians could be religious. The people that I knew were not militant
                    religious. A lot of them were deeply personally religious. They would fast, they
                    would pray, they would go to Mecca. They were not militant about it. The name
                    Khomeini did not really become prominent in public, out loud, until the year
                    1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not a topic among your friends, and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, the friends of mine who were anti-Shah - and there were a lot of
                    them - never discussed it in religious terms. They were basically secular people
                    who were opposed on political grounds because they wanted more freedom or they
                    wanted no more censorship or things like that. Those were my friends. Now that's
                    also a self-selected community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I mean this was true of... I think this is so
                        typical of the Foreign Service type because you don't find, with the
                        exception maybe of a devout Mormon or somebody like that who also is very
                        limited in his sphere, we don't have those roots into the religious
                        community, and neither do we... and I mean, anyway, we're Christian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We don't associate religion and politics. No one associates religion
                    and politics in that way in the United States. A foreign diplomat is not likely
                    to come here and pay a call on the local cardinal. He might pay a call on one of
                    the Christian Evangelists - maybe not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also, I think it would be very hard for somebody from
                        Great Britain, for example, to come and to understand Jerry Falwell or
                        something like that, who from the historical perspective is a fundamental
                        Christian of the far right. I mean they don't even speak the same
                        language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Now, I can go on later about the religious community and the history of
                    it and what a profound effect that group has on politics later.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that. So you're off to Tabriz,
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Tabriz, the very end of the summer, early autumn of 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the setup there, the consulate. Who was
                        consul, what did it do? And then we'll talk about the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The physical setup of Tabriz was spectacular. It was one of the grand
                    old consulates. The Tabriz consulate sat on approximately 15 acres of walled in
                    garden. It had 1200 trees inside the wall. It had an Olympic-size swimming pool,
                    a six-car garage, a guest house, an absolutely lovely home, and a beautiful
                    office building surrounded by gardens and landscaping and tree-lined driveways,
                    fountains, bird ponds, fish ponds, a volley-ball field, a field for playing
                    football, a rose garden, grape arbors - the whole bit. It had been laid out by
                    an American architect when America was flush with money, in the 1960s, laid out
                    and set up principally, I think, at CIA pressure, because it was built to serve
                    as a border-watching post. It was right on the Soviet border. I was only 45
                    minutes by car away from the USSR border. I was also fairly close to the Turkish
                    border, about an hour and a half to two hours, and not that distant from the
                    Iraqi border. It was a very strategic location. What happened, though, was that
                    satellites popped up just after the place was built, and it had been designed
                    for 10 American officers - it went down to one. They had two American officers
                    the year before I got there. It was going to be sold, closed and sold off in a
                    big land exchange deal by the embassy, which is why they hadn't bothered to
                    staff it. But then the closure got delayed because the land deal started to fall
                    through, and they suddenly had to find someone to put out there. There I was
                    sitting in the Consular Section. They put me out there. It was a great job.
                    Instead of going out for a few months - you know, to close the post and be a
                    holding action - I went out there and the revolution started. And it started in
                    Tabriz, which I guess was fortuitous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the only American there, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The only American State Department person. There was a small American
                    detachment at the Air Force Base, and we also had an Army attach� there. They
                    were separate. We were all friends. I saw them socially. There was no sort of
                    chain of command with us. We were all independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Tabriz in the context of Iran at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Tabriz probably had a population of close to a million people, which
                    for Iran made it the second to third biggest city in the country. It would have
                    been Teheran and then either Isfahan or Tabriz. Tabriz was a Turkish city. It
                    had a very distinct identity. People in the city spoke Turkish. It had a heavy
                    Armenian population as well. There were Christian churches there, as there were
                    in most cities in Iran. But it was very non-Persian. It had traditionally been
                    the capital of Azerbaijan. It had also, in the days of the Qajar dynasty, before
                    the Pahlavi dynasty came into power, been the city where the crown prince would
                    sit and rule until his father died in Teheran. So the city had a rather proud
                    tradition of being the seat of the second person in power in the country. That
                    had changed. One could say it was an industrial city, a lot of factories around
                    it, oil refinery, good connections to all of western Iran, and it was the city
                    where, if you were going by land to Europe, you had to pass through Tabriz, or
                    rather the outskirts of it. The roads came through the city. At one point I
                    think it had been far more important. Before airports started carrying
                    passengers and freight, everybody came through Tabriz. Everything entering Iran
                    from the west passed through Tabriz, through the bazaar there, through the roads
                    there. Planes had done away with a lot of the heavier traffic, but still there
                    was a fairly constant flow of people and goods through the city in both
                    directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, up in that corner of Iran, was anything
                        going on? You know, there had been Kurdish revolts and all that. One always
                        says it's a rough neighborhood, and you have Turkey and Iraq and the Soviet
                        Union and Iran all up there. Anything going on there at the time you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Kurds were quiet. They had not had any insurrections in quite a
                    while. Mullah Mustafa Barzani, who was the last of the great Turkish guerilla
                    leaders, had been defanged and actually he was living in Virginia at that point
                    with one or two of his sons here. He died in the United States, in the year
                    1979. But he was quiet. The Kurds were quiet generally. Smuggling, of course, a
                    lot of back and forth across the border. There is always smuggling, but in
                    general no other activity from the Kurdish areas. Turkic or Turkish nationalism
                    was not really a factor, I don't think. There was so much happening in the
                    country, and there were so many alternative methods of expression that that had
                    ceased to be important for a while. And the Shah was actually not bad in that
                    sense. He treated all the other nationalities equally - rather dismally at
                    times, but fairly equally. And his wife, of course, was half Turkish extraction,
                    so that helped. Other than that, no, the borders were quiet. The people on the
                    Caspian were quiet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets messing around at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Soviets were not messing around. They had a major project, the
                    electrification of the railway project. There was a rail line that went directly
                    from Tabriz up to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Trade Mission in Tabriz had
                    approximately 200 Soviets attached to it, which made it fairly large as a trade
                    mission, matched with the one American over at the consulate. But the embassy
                    really believed that nothing was happening in that whole part of Iran, because
                    apparently the Shah had told them so, and that all power and all activity was
                    centered in north Teheran, therefore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about listening posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, nothing was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was done on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I didn't even have communications facilities. I had a telephone, and I
                    eventually got a telex line, which I actually never used. By the time it came in
                    it was moot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was told to go out, spend several months there, that the whole
                    property was going to be sold, and that I was to be involved in wrapping it up,
                    ceasing services, sort of closing down bits and pieces of the consulate, and
                    helping the Department close up this post, and I would come back and they would
                    give me another assignment in Iran. And that was fine, except that when I got
                    there the land deal collapsed. The Iranian entrepreneur with whom the embassy
                    had been dealing could not get his act together or his money together, and the
                    big exchange, where he was going to take the land in Tabriz and give the embassy
                    something in Teheran and put up a building for a new embassy or a new consulate,
                    all this, it just never happened.</p>
                <p>The revolution period started fairly quickly. I arrived in let's say September of
                    '77, and the first major rioting broke out in February of '78, pretty close
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went there, talk a bit about getting settled in.
                        Did you do the- (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>METRINKO: There was a very good FSN (Foreign Service National) staff at the
                    consulate, both the support staff - the people who did the gardening (We had two
                    full-time gardeners plus three part-time), a good guard staff of local
                    employees, a good maid, a good cook, a very good driver, a very good admin
                    person, a superb guy, who ran the whole compound as it if were his own house,
                    and he'd been brought up on the compound because his father before him had
                    worked there - and a very good, what we called then “provincial advisor.” This
                    was a senior FSN whose job was to give advice and guidance to the American
                    officers. This one was great. He knew everybody in the area; he knew all the
                    governors general; he knew all the police officials and everyone else; and
                    basically he helped me go out to meet and brief people, introduced me to people.
                    We had a small visa section that I also handled, which processed just enough
                    visas in a normal workday - 15, 20, 30 visas a day - that it kept me in touch
                    with a lot of people who needed visas. People would come to me because they had
                    to. And also there was a strong feeling that the United States was Iran's
                    biggest ally; therefore, the local officials, local business people who had a
                    lot of back-and-forth with the United States would come through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having a problem with refusing people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had a refusal rate, but we never had the lines or the sort of
                    pressure that came up. It was literally enough for one person to handle.</p>
                <p>Now I had a good Iranian social life, because there were the normal people who
                    always had the American consul to their homes, to their receptions. The
                    officials were basically friendly. I was also correct in my dealings with them.
                    I mean I met them. I would pay calls on them, introduce myself. I was
                    responsible for the seven states of western Iran, so I had a huge consular
                    district, which I visited fairly frequently. I would go off for a week at a time
                    with a car and a driver, and when I would go off like that, normally somebody
                    from the embassy would come and sit in my place for a week or so. It worked out
                    well. I got to most of the provinces, many of the cities. In fact I started a
                    regular routine of certain cities at certain times of the year, and I would also
                    do visa work when I went to those cities, instead of having the applicants
                    travel two or three days to get to Teheran. It worked out. I had a very pleasant
                    time. People were receptive. I also had probably better contact with the normal
                    people of the city than most of my predecessors. I spoke Persian and Turkish,
                    and as far as I know I was the only one ever assigned there who spoke both
                    languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you receive any directions or instructions about
                        what to do. I'm talking about other than political. I mean on reporting. Did
                        you find the embassy said, “We want to know what's going on up there”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Instruction from the embassy and contact with the embassy was minimal.
                    No one in the course of my entire posting - well, how many years there - from
                    September of '77 until February of '79 - I never had a visit from the Political
                    Section. No one cared. The political section did not visit the western part of
                    Iran. I had visits occasionally from other sections of the embassy. USIA, for
                    example, came out quite often because they had professional duties out there.
                    I'll tell you an incident about a phone call I had. I'd been out there for
                    several months. It was early one morning. I was passing through the front
                    hallway of the house. The phone rang. I walked over to pick it up. When the
                    phone would ring at night or on holidays or before we turned the switchboard
                    number over, it would ring in the house, and then it would become part of the
                    switchboard over in the office building. But if I was there alone I would answer
                    the phone. I picked up the phone, and on the other side was someone who
                    introduced himself as the new DCM. And I was struck dumb because in my several
                    months there I had never had a call from the front office of the embassy. So I
                    almost didn't know how to react. But neither Mr. Miklos nor the ambassador ever
                    thought there was a reason to call or contact one of their constituent posts.
                    Never.</p>
                <p>Now I had a short brief list from the Political Section of things they wanted me
                    to... You know, the grand reporting plan. Prominent on that was evidence of
                    Turkish nationalism, a couple of other things like that. How do the people in
                    the western provinces feel about this or that? There was nothing significant,
                    and it would all be considered minor reporting today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm probably belaboring the point because it does become
                        very important, obviously. Was there anything, So how's the shah doing out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They weren't interested, and “how's the shah doing out there” did not
                    become a subject for reporting until after the rioting in the city in February
                    of '78. Then it became a subject for reporting. Up until then they would not
                    have welcomed, nor did they ask for, nor did they want anything about local
                    feeling toward the shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back a bit, I don't remember where you... We
                        talked about the effects of the “white revolution,” or not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We haven't talked about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay - well, I mean, you'd been there before. Were you
                        seeing an impact of what the shah was trying to do that was highly touted in
                        the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes and no. I can give you two stories about the white revolution from
                    Iranians whom I knew well. One was from an old friend of mine who had been one
                    of the Shah's tutors when the Shah was a young kid. Talking about the white
                    revolution with this guy once, he looked at me and said, “Michael, you don't
                    think that we really lost anything in the white revolution, do you? What
                    happened was that we knew what was going to be happening, that the Shah was
                    going to be confiscating or picking up large estates. In our case, we turned
                    everything over to Imam Reza.” This means the religious shrine in Mashad. He
                    said, “We turned it all over to them, and then we rented it back in perpetuity
                    from them for a small fee every year so that when the white revolution came, we
                    owned nothing, lost nothing, kept everything.” That was his example. He was a
                    major landowner, too. The White Revolution hit the middle class of landowner and
                    the sort of top rung of the peasant class who had bought land. It hit the
                    village landlords, who maybe had one village or half a village. They lost. Their
                    land was divided up. What you would see - and I saw this over and over... I have
                    lots of pictures of this. What I used to see in the Peace Corps in the villages,
                    were large homes which had been abandoned and had fallen into ruin, because they
                    had been the village landlord's house. And a lot of resentment in that class of
                    people... I can't think of what the right term. “Village landlord,” I guess,
                    would be the only thing I could say. That class deeply resented the white
                    revolution. They had lost. And I remember a friend, an Iranian friend who was
                    the president of one of the banks in my Peace Corps site, taking me out once to
                    show me where he had been brought up, and we went into his old home in the
                    village. His father had been the local landlord, and his grandfather. The home
                    that they had had there had been a very large village home, but apparently a
                    quite nice, spread-out villa. It was in a state of total ruin. The roof had
                    collapsed, the windows were all gone. They'd abandoned the home because they no
                    longer had the land to support it, and instead of becoming a landlord himself he
                    had had to get a job in a bank. His father was sitting on the floor of his house
                    in the town. People like that deeply resented the Shah and what he had done
                    because they knew the Shah had not lost. The Shah himself did not lose money
                    during the white revolution. He did not give up what he owned.</p>

                    in the solid middle class at the time, the landowners, in order to pacify the
                    United States and a couple of other Western countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you arrived, prior to the riots and all that,
                        was this... One always hears about, one talks about the Iranians and the
                        bazaaris. Was the merchant class an important factor? They would strike me
                        as being a junction of all sorts of things going through there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, people talk about the bazaris as if they come in a strange color
                    or can be identified because they have bubbles around their heads. It's probably
                    a misnomer. Bazari means someone who is associated with the bazaar, the market.
                    In some cities you had big covered markets - Isfahan, for example, that makes it
                    a very good one. Khorramshahr had a small one. Teheran, or course, had an
                    immense one. But these were the merchants and traders; they weren't necessarily
                    the businessmen. Businessmen, the big entrepreneurs, had offices in office
                    buildings. Now, communications were changing. The bazaars were nexi of old
                    communications routes. That's where the camel trains went. That meant near a
                    bazaar it was impossible to find parking along the narrow, winding roads, a sort
                    of mass, a labyrinth of small alcoves and shops and little houses and little
                    buildings all tied together under tin roofs. A lot of bazaar merchants were
                    very, very wealthy, yes. A lot of people who were not in the bazaar, who were
                    businessmen with offices in regular office buildings, with their fax machines
                    and their telephones and their TVs, were also very wealthy and prominent. They
                    both existed. They were often the same people as well. One brother might have
                    his place in the bazaar, sit on the floor there in his stall and sell carpets,
                    and the other brother might be sitting behind a big Louis Quatorze desk his
                    office building two miles away using a fax and telephone. The one in the bazaar
                    also had a fax and telephone, but it was probably a little bit dusty and behind
                    a bunch of carpets. But they both existed and they were both part of the
                    business scene.</p>
                <p>The bazaris were concentrated more and they tended to be more involved in guilds
                    and associations, which gave them discipline and, therefore, power. For example,
                    you would have the rug merchants in one section of the bazaar and copper
                    merchants in another section of the bazaar, people who dealt in towels in
                    another section, people who dealt in wood furniture in another section. Because
                    they were grouped in sections and because they had communication, because they
                    tended to go to the same places to pray and because they could be reached as a
                    group fairly quickly, they had discipline, and therefore the perception of
                    power. Businessmen who were off in secluded offices could be reached by
                    telephone, but there had been a breakdown of that visible type of unity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, who were sort of the power brokers in the area
                        where you were? The military? The Shah's governor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The government administration ran like this. There were in Azerbaijan
                    Province, or in this case in East Azerbaijan Province, there were a fair number
                    of military bases, each of which had a commander. There were a fair number of
                    generals in the area. I knew several of them. In Tabriz there was an army base.
                    There was also an armory in Tabriz. There was an air force base out near the
                    airport. We had an American military attach�, an Army guy, assigned to the
                    military base in the city. We had several Air Force guys assigned to the air
                    force base. There was a governor general appointed by the Shah. There was the
                    equivalent of a county commissioner, farmandar, also appointed. There would be a
                    city mayor, also appointed. There weren't too many elected positions - in fact,
                    I can't think of any offhand. Members of parliament were elected. But there was
                    only one political party, so the political party headquarters also, of course,
                    had a head, also appointed. That was the power structure. Of course, the
                    national police would have a general in charge of the police force there. SAVAK
                    would have someone in charge of the SAVAK office. These were appointed career
                    positions.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing about the network of appointed government positions is that
                    they weren't aloud to talk to each other very much. The Shah had a phobia about
                    his generals meeting each other, and if you were assigned as a general to an
                    army base or air force base, etc., you were not allowed to leave the base
                    without the permission of the Shah's office. Now this is strange. This means
                    that if you are a general and you are in charge of the base at, for example,
                    Ajabshir, you couldn't leave it without getting permission directly from
                    Teheran. I had a case once where a general from that particular base called me
                    up, very pleasant, very apologetic, said that his son's school in America and
                    the school required another affidavit of support from the father. The father had
                    this all ready, the proper documentation, but he was supposed to sign it in
                    front of me to get my notarial seal on it. Would I allow him to sign it in his
                    own office and to send it to me with a driver? I said, well, why? Why don't you
                    just drop it off some day when you're in Tabriz? And he said, “I'm not allowed
                    to leave my base unless I get permission from the Shah, and I don't want to call
                    his office up to get permission just for this. It's awkward, and they would have
                    too many questions.” So I said sure. I signed it that way. Consular officers are
                    not supposed to do this, but in this case, I knew who he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this must have given the generals a great feeling of
                        lack of trust.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, absolutely. I'll give you another example. The governor general, a
                    civilian, of the West Azerbaijan Province, based in Rezayeh, told me this story.
                    Part of his province, the road through his province that connected all the
                    cities of his province ran very briefly, just for a few kilometers, through
                    another province. It ran through the Kurdish province, and in order to go to one
                    of the cities in his province, he had to go, for a couple of kilometers, into
                    another governor general's area and just continue on the asphalt highway. He did
                    not have permission to do this. He could not leave his province, even if he were
                    doing it in order to get to another part of his province. And he told me that in
                    his time as government general he had never succeeded in getting permission to
                    use that road to get to the last city in his province. Therefore, he had never
                    seen that city. Same reason. The Shah...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting at this point in your own mind? What
                        were you picking up about the Shah as far as... Was it the Shah? Was it the
                        group around him? Was he a weak man? Was he megalomaniac?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, I was picking up that Iran was a house of cards, that there were
                    a great many people, including people high up in the system, who did not like
                    it, did not know what to do about it, but that the whole thing might come
                    tumbling down - certainly that the Shah himself was no longer competent, that he
                    did not have the training or the ability to run such a large country in the
                    autocratic way he wanted to run it. Business people would tell me about having
                    to bribe the Shah's brothers and sisters if you want to get permission for any
                    major development plan. There were a lot of major factories in Tabriz. You were
                    required to turn over a portion of the shares of the company or part of the
                    deal, a slice of that pie, to a member of the Shah's family in order to get
                    permission to get it done. The mayor of the city of Tabriz, brand new mayor,
                    appointed by the Shah, in the early spring of 1978, when there still was not
                    really... I was introduced to him in a military setting. There was a large lunch
                    being hosted by the Iranian military officers of the city. It think it was in
                    honor of the participants in an international weight-lifting championship or
                    something like that. I'd been invited as one of the foreign diplomats, but most
                    of the whole crowd of about 100 people at the lunch were in military uniform,
                    and I was seated at a table with the few civilians. I was there. I think the
                    Turkish consul was there, the Turkish consul being the only other diplomat. And
                    I was seated directly across from the new mayor, who had just arrived and whom I
                    had not yet met. We started to talk, and... Oh, no, I have to pinpoint this more
                    directly - it was at the time that the Shah was going to be visiting the United
                    States. And I don't recall when that was now exactly, but he was coming to visit
                    Carter in the United States. But before the visit. And the new mayor, who did
                    not yet know me, and surrounded at a table with military officials and other
                    officials, looked at me and said, “Well, how are Mr. Carter and Mr. Shah doing
                    together?” He said it like that. And I just looked at him because I thought he
                    was making maybe a mistake in English, and I said, “Well, they seem to be doing
                    quite well, and I understand the Shah's going to be visiting the United States
                    soon.” And the mayor looked up and said, “Good, then he'll have a place to
                    escape to when he has to leave Iran.” He was the mayor of Iran's number two or
                    three city!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any information at this point of the
                        mullahs? I mean, one hears about the tapes of Khomeini and all that. I mean
                        was this a name that was being bandied about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The first time, I think, that anyone in the 1970s reported the name of
                    Khomeini in open telegram reporting was me. The name was used during the rioting
                    in Tabriz in February of 1978. I could hear crowds screaming Khomeini, long live
                    Khomeini! I had never seen his name in print. I didn't know who it was. I asked.
                    I was told. I reported it in a long memo. In fact, it was an aerogram, I think,
                    on the subject of what happened in Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you talk about that. I think we've come to
                        that point now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What had happened?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. I mean from your perspective.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I'll talk about it from my perspective then, and I'll tell you a story
                    that I heard from an ayatollah many, many years later about the same incident.
                    What happened was that in February of 1978, as we found out, 40 days after
                    demonstrations and rioting had swept the city of Qom, the religious center,
                    Tabriz started to riot. The rioting was unexpected. Buildings started to burn.
                    Crowds were running in the street. I had a lot of protection around the
                    consulate, but we didn't know why it was happening or what was happening. We
                    just knew there was rioting going on in the city. I had a security guard force,
                    a personal security guard provided by the Iranian police of three Iranian
                    sergeants. I sent them home because they had gotten so tense and worried looking
                    that I didn't want to be responsible to them. And I figured if something was
                    going to happen to the consulate, I'd have a better chance of getting away if I
                    didn't have them getting in my way, so I suggested that they just go back to
                    their own homes, that it was better for them not to be there. They left. The
                    rioting went on for the next two or three days. I was reporting, of course, all
                    the time by phone to the embassy from what I could see. It was not conducive to
                    wandering around the city. You don't go out into riots. And nobody seemed to
                    really know what was happening. But I was just hearing things from my friends.
                    Why are they rioting? Well, it's against the Shah. Why? It was all very unclear
                    then. But the rioting took 70 or 80 buildings. They burned them out. The
                    political party headquarters was attacked, gutted, ransacked, looted. They got
                    into the governor's palace and apparently surprised the governor in his pajamas.
                    He ran out the back door. A large number of banks were burned, and the contents,
                    the paper contents, the files of the banks, the desks, were thrown out into the
                    street so that for several days you could see bank documents sort of blowing
                    around the streets of the city. Why it had happened - ostensibly because they
                    were honoring the anniversary of people who had been killed in Qom 40 days
                    previously. The people who had been killed in Qom were being mourned. The
                    demonstrations in Qom had been kept very quiet. There was nothing in the press
                    about it. No one knew about this. Certainly I don't think the embassy knew about
                    it. If they knew, it was only in the most... But Tabriz was too big to hide. It
                    lasted too long, too many foreigners witnessed it, too many people had
                    photographs, and the newspapers ran pictures of it, ascribing all the problems
                    to hooligans in the city. I wrote a long report on the subject claiming that
                    there were social reasons, economic reasons, and dissatisfaction reasons,
                    mentioning the name of Khomeini, that he was a religious leader whose name the
                    people were using when they were rioting. I talked about the population, the
                    unemployment, other reasons that would lead to rioting like this. The embassy
                    sent my report out, but the Political Section added a line to the bottom of it
                    saying they did not agree with my analysis and that basically this was not
                    portent of anything to come; it was just a sort of one-time deal. I've always
                    treasured that comment by the Political Section of the embassy. I only saw it
                    much later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you talked to a religious man, an ayatollah, many

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, back in the year, I think, 1986, I was on the Iran-Iraq Desk. I
                    was the deputy director of Northern Gulf affairs, and we were talking to odd
                    ayatollahs who would come to the United States and various other religious
                    figures from Iran. A surprising number of people who portrayed themselves as
                    representatives of Khomeini would come in. In this particular case, a very close
                    associate of Khomeini's came in, Ayatollah Haeri. He was an ayatollah, who came
                    here for medical reasons. I had asked before I pushed the visa through the
                    system if he would be willing to meet with us when he arrived in the States. He
                    agreed. This was a man who had spent 17 years of his life living in the same
                    house as Khomeini. His father had been Khomeini's mentor. Khomeini had studied
                    in the house with this man's father, who was one of the grand, grand ayatollahs.
                    This man himself had become Khomeini's companion. His niece was married to
                    Khomeini's son, Khomeini's son Mustafa. Now, there's a reason for mentioning the
                    name. Khomeini had two sons, Mustafa and Ahmad, Mustafa being the older. Mustafa
                    died unexpectedly. He died very unexpectedly and in such an unusual way that the
                    story immediately spread that he had been assassinated by the secret police, by
                    SAVAK. This sparked rioting. The rioting ended up eventually sparking rioting in
                    Tabriz which then was followed by the 40 day cycle. Many 40 days followed one
                    another, so that soon you had constant rioting and the revolution. When this
                    ayatollah was in Washington, we were having lunch at the Tivoli Restaurant in
                    Rosslyn and we were talking about people I had known during the days of the
                    revolution whom he also knew. I made a reference to one and the unusual way in
                    which he had died, another ayatollah, and he said, “No, no, no, Michael, that's
                    a story just like the story about Mustafa's death.” And I said, “What do you
                    mean, the 'story about Mustafa's death'? Mustafa, Khomeini's son, was killed by
                    SAVAK, wasn't he?” And he said, “No, I was in the room when he died. Of course
                    he wasn't killed by SAVAK.” He said, “Michael, Mustafa was very fat man,” and he
                    stretched his arms out. “He was very, very fat, and when Mustafa ate, he would
                    eat with both hands.” And he pantomimed at the lunch table in the Tivoli
                    Restaurant somebody pushing food into their mouth with both hands, and he said,
                    “Mustafa was sitting there, we were eating together, and suddenly he clutched
                    his heart and fell right into the food. He had a heart attack, and he died of
                    gluttony.” He said, “We were afraid to tell his father what happened, so we said
                    SAVAK killed him. And then people started to protest, and they started to
                    demonstrate, and suddenly we had a revolution.” He said, “Michael, you don't
                    think we planned the revolution, do you?” And was that the reason for it? No.
                    Was it a spark? Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the consulate threatened at all during all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, sure, very often. During the initial period in February, no.
                    We had enough police guards around, and the army was very unsure of itself, but
                    they were all standing. The revolution had not yet spread to the army. This was
                    brand new. This was the start of it. This was a full year before Khomeini
                    returned, so the army was intact. The army stood guard; other people stood
                    guard. And basically nothing happened to the consulate. During the course of the
                    next year, of course, the consulate was hit, under attack severely once. Other
                    times we'd be hit by demonstrators who sort of walked by or demonstrated in
                    front. But severe attack - once, with one of the small buildings getting burned,
                    too. And then finally in February of '79, the second attack that ended up with
                    my going to prison in Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the February '78 riots and all, streets are finally
                        cleared and all, what were you doing? Going around finding out what
                        happened, why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That, but also business as usual. It was a very unusual aberration, we
                    thought, initially. I believe that I was right that it was a reflection of many
                    deep causes, economic, political, etc. etc., but as an incident it seemed to be
                    over. It's just that it wasn't. It started happening again, and it happened more
                    and more often in different cities of the country, and Tabriz was especially
                    prone to this. But it did not stop normal life. I mean I had my parents visiting
                    for three months in the year 1978, when shortly after they arrived martial law
                    was imposed on the city. But I had other visitors all through the year. I had an
                    inspection in the spring of 1978, when everything was bright and sunny and the
                    garden was beautiful and all the roses were out. The inspectors had a good time
                    in Tabriz. But at the same time, things were popping up all over the country;
                    it's just that the embassy didn't realize it because it was happening in places
                    where we had no diplomatic presence, but it was happening and starting to happen
                    more and more in towns and cities where we had people that witnessed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sort of business as usual... Tell me what you were
                        doing, how things developed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What was I doing? Well, I was getting to know my area, my consular
                    district. I was traveling up and down the whole length and breadth of it. I had
                    routine consular business every day. I had a very large number of Americans
                    scattered around the consular district. I had a big contingent in the city of
                    Khorramshahr; I had Americans in Rezayeh. I had Americans in Hamadan, Americans
                    all over Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A lot of them were there on contract. I had some American wives married
                    to Iranian husbands. I think I got to know every single couple in my whole
                    district like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they doing? Because this is not confined... When
                        I was in Saudi Arabia we've had this trouble of Americans marrying
                        foreigners, particularly - well, almost anywhere - and having children, and
                        breaking up with the husband, can't take the children. Were you having any
                        of those problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I myself did not see that. What I had were perhaps 20, 30 couples, but
                    in general they appeared quite happy. In general, the women spoke good Persian,
                    the American girls, and they were from a surprisingly educated and well-off
                    class of American girl, the ones that I knew. In fact, I'm still in touch with
                    some of them, some of the couples who are still married. But as an example, we
                    had an American woman doctor in Tabriz married to an Iranian doctor - people
                    like that. It was quite a decent, sort of an impressive group of women. I know
                    all the stories about American girls that go off and marry the oily foreigner
                    and get treated badly and get beaten up and lose their babies, etc. There wasn't
                    very much of that that I saw myself. Iranian law was heavily weighted against
                    women even then, and we did almost nothing in weighing in against these laws.
                    Not only the Shah could do no wrong, but if you were a woman in Iran and
                    married, your husband had full control over your ability to travel. You could
                    not apply for an exit permit or a passport without your husband's permission. If
                    you were married to an Iranian man, you were de facto an Iranian citizen. It was
                    conferred automatically, so the American girl from Oklahoma who married Ali and
                    came to Tabriz, as soon as she entered Iran, she was an Iranian citizen and was
                    subject to the rules about getting written permission from her husband to
                    travel. Women were discriminated against in divorce, certainly, discriminated
                    against in inheritance certainly. The idea of Iranian women at the time - even
                    Iranian women - if there were a divorce did not gain custody of the children.
                    They went to the man's family. If there was a death, if the husband died, the
                    children would also go to the man's family, not to the wife's. But I don't
                    recall any cases that we had where this was an issue.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the other American who were on contract? Because one hears about in
                    other places like, was it Isfahan or whatever... Well, the Bell Helicopter
                    mechanics and that sort of thing. Did you have any problems of that nature?</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I had Bell Helicopter. There were a few problems. I would say today
                    they were minor, and I don't really recall any. Nothing as exciting as some of
                    the things in Isfahan. I had a fair number of American military personnel, one
                    of whom had his spouse with him, but they were, again, a fairly good group, well
                    tuned into the local society, with Iranian friends, spoke a little bit of
                    Persian, no problem [communicating] at all - just the opposite, pretty
                    responsible and respectable. And that included a network of what we called “team
                    houses,” houses that were occupied by American military personnel spread around
                    various towns and cities of the country. We had several of those, but again
                    pretty much settled into local society. Other American presence? Basically that
                    was it. We had people assigned to the refinery, a number of American teachers.
                    In fact, another Foreign Service colleague of mine is someone who started out
                    being a teacher in Tabriz for the Iran-America Society. But no great difficulty
                    with the American community at all. That was a pretty sharp group of people that
                    were there for good reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things develop, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In what sense?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean you were going to have a revolution and you
                        were going to end up in jail in a while, and I mean how did things -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Why did it go from the rosy rose garden to -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I keep asking myself. I was promised a... The demonstrations spread.
                    There was extreme dissatisfaction with the Shah. People thought initially that
                    Carter was opposed to the Shah. People in Iran who disliked the Shah saw this as
                    an opportunity. I think if you were a revolutionary it was basically
                    serendipity. The Shah was losing it. He was feeling uneasy because he knew he
                    had cancer - maybe. His family's ability to be corrupt had reached a saturation
                    point. His brothers and sisters were scraping every dollar they could get out of
                    everybody. The channels of communication were improving, which meant that, I
                    think, a lot of people were getting information that they hadn't had access to.
                    And there must be a certain point at which, when you've sent a lot of your
                    country's students overseas, point of return at which what they've learned there
                    has started to have a real effect on them and on their peers back in Iran.
                    Enough thousands of students have left Iran and had returned with very different
                    feelings about the Shah's government, perhaps, than when they had left Iran,
                    that it was all reaching a bubbling point. And you had this very charismatic,
                    very strong religious figure in Iraq, the Ayatollah Khomeini, who was there to
                    pick up the reins. So it was all coming together.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you seeing a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, sure, yes. More and more open comments by people, a lot of open
                    comments. People starting to talk openly about their dissatisfaction. If the
                    Shah would change, or if he would allow a constitution, if he would allow a free
                    parliament, if he would allow this or that. And then, slowly, people were
                    talking about life without a Shah, which had been unthinkable for a long time,
                    and scraping up old grievances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought of, talking about life without a
                        Shah, what would replace it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No one that I remember talked about replacing the Shah with a
                    theocracy. But then again, I wasn't involved in religious circles. I was
                    involved in secular circles and people who were religious even, the ones I knew,
                    would never have thought of replacing the Shah with a religious Shah, a
                    religious autocrat. It just wasn't part of their thinking - as it was not part
                    of the thinking of many of the other religious leaders in Iran.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, then, sort of step by step, when do we sort of come to the next
                    development?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Developments, well, you had this pervasive spreading of anti-Shah
                    discontent, anti-government discontent, even among members of the government.
                    That was happening. As more and more people started to speak, others found their
                    courage to speak or to think about alternative forms of government. That was
                    happening. There had been a very big breakdown of Iranian society, Iranian
                    culture, that had taken place in the earlier '70s because of the oil money. An
                    awful lot of people had become rootless. They no longer had connections with the
                    villages or the small towns because they had left to find jobs in the bigger
                    cities. If you were on the streets of Teheran, if you walked down the streets,
                    you could see hundreds and hundreds of people who were milling aimlessly around
                    the streets. They had nothing to do. They were probably job hunting, but in the
                    meantime they were walking, walking slowly, just sort of staring around them. A
                    lot of these were young guys who'd go out into the streets like that. But you
                    had the fuel to immediately set off a demonstration in any city on any city
                    street. It was always there, sort of like people smoking around gasoline tanks.
                    Eventually it's going to catch. These guys who were walking around, they were
                    the gasoline. All you needed was a spark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were there, that was the fuel. And once you'd start a little
                    wildfire, it's very hard to control.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>At the same time, there were other interesting things happening. One of the old
                    SAVAK leaders, the guy who was in charge of the United States, Rafi-Zadeh, but
                    who was involved in SAVAK during this period, in his book, wrote about how SAVAK
                    itself would create incidents during this period and spark demonstrations so
                    that they could get the Shah to give them more power and more money. And he
                    talked about SAVAK people going out and smashing car windows and starting little
                    fires so that the Shah would think he really needed SAVAK. That was happening.
                    It wasn't all just unplanned on the streets. There were people who planned
                    demonstrations.</p>
                <p>I talked to - this is going to sound... It's good street tactics. After the
                    revolution - the revolution's still going on, but after Khomeini came in and we
                    were starting to cozy up to the new revolutionary government - I had a lot of
                    talks with people who had fought on the streets, fought in the revolution as
                    members of various groups. I remember one long conversation one night in Teheran
                    with a guy who had been part of a leftist sort of guerilla group. What his group
                    would do when they wanted to set off an incident, they would infiltrate the
                    soldiers. I mean, Iranians all served in the military, so Iranians knew how to
                    be a soldier. It was easy to buy uniforms. You could go to a tailor and have one
                    made. You could buy them. A lot of Iranians had their uniforms tailored for
                    themselves rather than take the stock issue, so this was not a problem. And all
                    you had to do was shave your head, put on a uniform that you got from the
                    tailor, and you were a soldier again. Well, these guys from this particular
                    group would infiltrate groups of soldiers, especially during periods of
                    confrontation with crowds, and they would set off the first spark. They would
                    shoot. So the crowd would respond, and then the soldiers would respond against
                    the crowd. But a lot of that was set off by revolutionary infiltrators.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Tabriz? What was happening in Tabriz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: More and more chaos in the streets, factory closings, strikes,
                    universities and schools are being closed. And a whole series of 40 day events
                    followed one on the other but more than every 40 days, where there would be a
                    little flare-up, something would get burned, something would get smashed, a car
                    would be overturned, tires would be burned in the streets, marital law would
                    come in.</p>

                        and I would think you would have had a bunch of other young men, young

                        you would have a group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, I was out every night. Or they were over at my house every
                    night.</p>

                        they exchange things. I would think you would be sort of a center, a beehive
                        of activity, at least -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I think I was either out or had people over like that to my house every
                    single night of the next year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you getting from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Just as I've said, increasing anti-Shah sentiment, including from
                    people who had every reason to support the Shah's government, but they wanted
                    something else. They wanted the Shah out of their lives, or they wanted him
                    castrated so that he couldn't affect them any more. They were tired of all the
                    hand-clapping, tired of all the “long live the Shah-” (end of tape)</p>
                <p>What I did in order to meet a lot of younger people, I started meeting them at
                    sports activities, I started meeting them because they came to the consulate, or
                    I'd meet one who would introduce me to others; but what I also did, the
                    consulate had a huge swimming pool, an Olympic-size swimming pool, dressing
                    room, bathrooms, etc. Now my predecessors had always used it either for
                    themselves or they had used it for the foreign community. There was a small
                    British community especially that used to love coming over to the consulate and
                    using the pool and the tennis courts. I thought this was a bit silly. I saw no
                    reason at all to run the American consulate for the benefit of the British
                    expatriate community. So what I did was to get in touch with two swimming
                    coaches from the local high schools, and I turned over the whole section of the
                    consulate recreation facilities, the swimming pool, the wading pool for
                    children, the tennis court, which was separate from the house - I turned that
                    over to these guys and opened it up to people in the community. We passed out
                    word in the immediate geographic area of the consulate that anyone who wanted to
                    use the pool, the tennis court, could do so on certain days of the week. I think
                    it was on four days of the week. And we had family days and we had bachelor days
                    because Iranian families, married women, etc., young women could not mix with
                    Iranian bachelors. So I had it set up differently, and basically turned it over
                    to the coaches to run, with a lot of help, of course, from the FSN staff, who
                    were aghast that I had done this. And the British community was not only aghast
                    but desolated and incensed that I had done this. But because of this I had a
                    constant stream of young, old, every type of Iranian coming into the consulate
                    grounds and using the recreational facilities. I figured I couldn't use the pool
                    at all - I was always in the office - so why have it filled with all those cubic
                    tons of water. It worked out well. It was used for a long summer, a very, very
                    long summer, a beautiful summer, and 50 or 60 young kids from the area,
                    according to the coaches, learned how to swim in that period.</p>

                        I'd fill in this. What would you reply - now here you are, you're the
                        American representative in this area, people are getting more and more... as
                        more and more discontent, our official policy was strong support of the Shah
                        and all, and the Shah and the embassy were far away - what were you
                        saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And I was getting precious little guidance. Basically, I was trying to
                    play it cool. I would sit and listen. If they were very, very close friends -
                    and this means if they were friends I had had from Peace Corps days, because my
                    Peace Corps site had been in that district, too, and they were people I really
                    liked and trusted - then I would tell them how I felt about the Shah. But if I
                    gave American policy it was support for the government and people of Iran. It
                    got to be a bit embarrassing towards the middle of the year, but that was the
                    American policy.</p>

                        almost through '78, would you say? Or when did Khomeini come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Khomeini came back in February of 1979. We want to talk about a couple

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I want to talk about Jaleh Square, and the impact that had in Tabriz. I
                    want to talk about the Cinema Rex fire in Abadan and the impact that had in
                    Tabriz, what they meant for the revolution, and some of the strange
                    circumstances that surrounded both incidents. And then I want to talk about the
                    report that I had of mass defection at the Tabriz Air Force Base and how the
                    embassy responded when I passed on the news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, we'll do that, then, and continue this.
                        Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 23rd of June, 2000. Mike, we're going to talk a little about some of
                    the things that you were involved in, reporting, observing on, in Iran really
                    before Khomeini came back. So that was the air force defection, the Cinema Rex,
                    and there was a demonstration in a square, I think.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The first is an easy one, Jaleh Square. Jaleh Square is a large public
                    square in Teheran. There was a confrontation there in 1978, and during the
                    confrontation a large number of people were killed by soldiers. Soldiers opened
                    fire, shot into the crowd, and I've heard all sorts of varying estimates. I
                    don't know the number now, but the estimates were significant. Because of what
                    happened at Jaleh Square, the country shifted very perceptibly against the Shah,
                    against the Shah's army, and towards Khomeini. Among the rumors that started
                    immediately because of Jaleh Square, was one that the Shah had brought in
                    Israeli soldiers and they had done the actual shooting. This rumor spread
                    through the country, and this kind of marked a real watershed in the way people
                    looked at the Shah. What they would say was, he couldn't get Iranian soldiers to
                    shoot Iranians, so he brought in soldiers from Israel. A couple of weeks, maybe
                    a month later, in Tabriz, I had a new guard detachment assigned to protect the
                    perimeter of the consulate. And these guys used to come and sit in the house,
                    and we'd play cards etc. They'd use the washing machine, the dryer, and
                    basically they were always around. I've noted that the consulate was a large
                    area. They had to patrol the whole inside, outside perimeter while they were
                    staying in the guest house at the consulate. Well, I was sitting playing cards
                    one night, and I noticed that two of them sitting there, there were patches on
                    their fatigues that had been taken off. I could see where there had been
                    something on their shoulders, and it had been removed. And just out of
                    curiosity, I said, “What's missing from your uniforms? What did you remove?” And
                    one of them laughed, and he said, “Oh, we had a lot of trouble with this. We had
                    a custom in the army where each platoon would adopt the colors of a foreign
                    country and use it as a patch on their uniforms.” For example, there were
                    soldiers whose platoons used the American flag or the Norwegian flag or the
                    Italian Flag, and he said, “Our platoon had the Israeli flag, and we were
                    assigned to Jaleh Square. We weren't allowed to talk to people, and when the
                    shooting started and we got involved in the shooting, everyone thought we were
                    Israelis because they could see the symbols on our uniforms. So afterwards, when
                    we got out of that trouble and we were reassigned to this province, to
                    Azerbaijan Province, our commander told us to remove those colors from our
                    uniforms.” But that was the reason that that rumor started, and just the fact
                    that somebody was wearing the flag of another country or a symbol of another
                    country proved important in switching public opinion against the Shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Simple things. That was one. Cinema Rex. The Rex Cinema was a movie
                    theater in the town of Abadan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a big refinery town.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It's a big refinery town in Khuzestan Province, a southern Province.
                    Khuzestan Province had been rather uninvolved in the revolution. It had been
                    quite quiet there, possible because people were well employed, there was lots of
                    work, the economies were going full-tilt, it was an Arab ethnic province, not
                    particularly Persian, more Arab. So even the religious leaders there were not as
                    tied to Qom and other places and to Khomeini as they might have been. It was
                    also a rather secular city because of all the oil workers who were there. One
                    evening, the Rex Cinema caught fire when there was a movie going on. When people
                    tried to get out, they discovered the doors had been locked on the outside.
                    Everyone in the theater burned to death. A couple of hundred people died. There
                    was an immediate outcry that the fire had been set by the Shah's secret police.
                    Now using logic, there was no reason for them to have done so, but hysteria, the
                    story went all around the country that the Shah's SAVAK had done this. They were
                    responsible for the death of all these people, and various explanations were
                    given - that there was an anti-Shah rally going on, the film being shown was
                    anti-Shah, etc., etc. But the fact was that a great number of people burned to
                    death, and had been locked inside the theater. Now, immediately, of course, the
                    theater manager said that the reason the doors had been locked on the outside
                    was to prevent people from sneaking in and seeing the movie for free, but they
                    running from the lynch mobs and they didn't have too much time to talk. When
                    Khomeini came back, he sent down, of course, a very pro-revolutionary governor
                    general to Khuzestan Province, and a good friend of mine became the new mayor of
                    Abadan. He went down with the general. His first priority, he was told by the
                    new governor general of the province, was to completely investigate what had
                    happened in the Cinema Rex fire. His conclusion when he completed the study was
                    that the fire had been set by revolutionaries, members of the clergy, or people
                    acting under the direction of members of the clergy as an attempt to stir people
                    up against the Shah. When he presented the study to the revolutionary governor
                    general, he was told to keep the report sealed, never to refer to it again, and
                    to forget that it had been done - period. But that too, that particular fire,
                    really caused a lot of bloodshed. And I guess people understand now that it had
                    probably been set by the revolutionaries themselves.</p>
                <p>Q: Were they setting it all as a protest against secular things like movies?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Who knows? Against the idea of the movie - they were trying to burn
                    down cinemas all over the country. The fact that there were a couple of hundred
                    people locked inside and that they turned out to be the brothers, cousins,
                    uncles of the people who were setting the fire, that was something else again.
                    It was unfortunate.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The last incident, the report of a defection at the air force base in late 1978.
                    A friend of mine who was an Iranian assigned to the office of the commander of
                    the air force base in Tabriz called me up one day on a Friday and he said he had
                    to see me immediately. He had something he wanted to tell me. I invited him over
                    to the house, and he came over. He was in the inner-circle staff of the base
                    commander, and he told me that something very unusual had happened - it was the
                    local Sabbath, so [part of] the base had been closed for normal business - and
                    that a large number of pilots had walked in, stood in line, and one by one
                    handed in their resignations, saying they could no longer support the present
                    government. He said the base commander had received all these resignations and
                    asked the pilots to wait. He had then called up a friend of his who was the base
                    commander at Shiraz, where the same thing was occurring. Pilots were handing in
                    their resignations saying they couldn't support the Shah's regime anymore. And
                    my friend told me that these two generals had decided to go along with the
                    pilots. The commander in Shiraz and the commander in Tabriz asked the pilots to
                    withdraw the resignations and just hold tight until they could take over the
                    base, until they could really switch, when it became critical at the time. The
                    pilots had agreed. They had withdrawn their resignations, and the whole thing
                    was being kept very, very quiet.</p>
                <p>Well, I had to report this to the embassy. There was only one way I could do it.
                    There was an old way of communicating information called one-time pads. I don't
                    know if you-</p>

                <p>METRINKO: I used a one-time pad and sent a message, called it in by phone. I had
                    never done one of these before, so it took me a long time to write it. The
                    person on the other end who had to decipher it had never deciphered one before,
                    and it took him an equally long time to decipher it. But they got the message.
                    He called up the DCM and took the message to the DCM's house. The DCM was
                    playing cards with a group of other people. They contacted the ambassador. The
                    ambassador read the message and turned to the U.S. military commander there and
                    asked him if he could get corroboration of the message. They called the base at
                    Tabriz. The one who answered the phone was the American bartender at the base
                    bar, and the base bar - this was the bar in the U.S. Air Force team house at the
                    base, where they ran an open bar, even in the middle of the revolution, in the
                    middle of all the anti-American uproar that was going on in the country, they
                    had an open bar to serve alcohol at the American tea house on the base, a base
                    which, of course, had just seen a massive resignation of people opposed to the
                    government. The Air Force guy told me this story later. General Gast said,
                    “Sergeant, the American consul in Tabriz just sent a message in to the embassy
                    here saying there's been a mass resignation of air force personnel. Do you know
                    anything about this?” The guy said, “No, Sir, I haven't seen anything like that,
                    Sir.” He turned to the guys in the bar and said, “Does anybody here know
                    anything about a lot of pilots resigning today?” And the people at the bar, of
                    course, all said, “Man, what are you talking about?” Of course, the pilots who
                    had resigned that day were highly unlikely to be sitting at a bar drinking
                    alcohol. So he went back to the phone and said, “No, general, nothing at all
                    like that here.” The general went back to the ambassador and said, “My people in
                    Tabriz totally deny that any such thing happened.” And I got summoned to Teheran
                    a couple of days later by the ambassador. I assumed he wanted to discuss the
                    message and what to do about it. Instead, I was threatened with being thrown out
                    of the country if I ever started a rumor like that again - period. I went back
                    to Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador at that time was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - Sullivan. And I was accused of starting rumors, being anti-Pahlavi
                    government etc., and reporting lies, and of being unprofessional. Of course,
                    about a month and a half later, when the commander of the air force base
                    arrested the army commander and a couple of other major military figures in
                    Tabriz and sent them off to die in Teheran, and when that air force commander
                    became the first Minister of Defense under Khomeini, people chose not to
                    remember that I had already written a month and a half ago that he had turned
                    coat. I later asked, by the way, because I met other officers who had taken part
                    in that, who had been involved in Tabriz, and I asked them what had happened
                    that day (this was way after Khomeini came back and the government had changed),
                    and I was told that everything I had reported was absolutely accurate, and they
                    couldn't understand how I had known about it because it was being kept
                    secret.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I would think they were pretty well isolated. To the best of my
                    knowledge, not one of them spoke Persian or Turkish, and so they could only
                    communicate in English. Some of them were pretty good guys. I'm not saying that
                    they weren't - especially the Army attach� was a great guy, and pretty much
                    clued in - but they were not supposed to do reporting and they were not trained
                    reporting officers. They were there for their technical skills, not as political
                    reporters. And they really did not have a great sense of what was happening in
                    the country.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: In Teheran? I've no idea. In the entire time that I was in Tabriz, for

                    Tabriz. No member of the Economic Section ever came to Tabriz. Or to western
                    Iran as far as I know.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They weren't very good officers, and they didn't speak Persian, and
                    they didn't like to travel. And they thought that everything was happening in
                    the capital in Teheran or at the Imperial Tennis Club. It's quite simple. How's
                    that for being harsh? It's, I still think, true.</p>

                        ourselves a little bit. I heard later that this sort of thing was really
                        part of the revolution. I was waving an audiocassette, I heard that tapes
                        were sent of Khomeini's sermons and all that. What are we talking about?
                        Early '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Khomeini returned to Iran in February of 1979. The revolution really
                    started approximately a year before that.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>METRINKO: In a report that I wrote in February of 1978, I referred to Khomeini
                    and said that was the name that people on the streets were chanting - “Khomeini
                    return” and “Long live Khomeini.” And so his name was very well known. Even I
                    had heard it. Very well known at least a year before that to the public. And I'd
                    say to just everybody in the public, whether pro or con.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened when he came back February of '79?
                        What was the reaction in Tabriz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's a bit complicated. First, when he returned, the armed forces did
                    an official surrender of all their powers to the new revolutionary government
                    and to Khomeini.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the Shah leave? Had the Shah left some time
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Sure, the Shah left several weeks before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Shah leaving. How did this play out
                        in Tabriz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: When the Shah left, there was a fair amount of euphoria expressed by
                    the people on the street. When we say the people of Tabriz, Tabriz is a city of
                    a million people. There was a public reaction in the streets by the
                    pro-revolutionaries. What people felt in their hearts, of course, is impossible
                    to know. I think a lot of people were still afraid of this sort of unrest and
                    the loss of power, loss of security. Tabriz had undergone an occupation by
                    anti-Shah forces following World War II. Right after World War II, when the
                    Soviets were still refusing to leave Iran, Tabriz had been taken over by a
                    Turkish nationalist movement, and the Shah's army had had to recapture Tabriz.
                    It took quite a while, too. It wasn't a one-day or one-month thing. A lot had
                    happened in the city during that takeover, and a lot of the people did not want
                    to repeat it. A lot of people had been executed, and a lot of people had been
                    killed. There had been a certain amount of destruction. So older people, anyone
                    who remembered World War II, was sort of unwilling to go through that again.
                    They may have felt very queasy about the change in government. Younger people,
                    pro-Khomeini kids, pretty much of a generational split, pro- and anti-Khomeini.
                    Older ones tended to not approve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the younger ones who weren't very
                        religious?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It didn't matter if you were religious or not. If you were young, then
                    you were a revolutionary. I can't think of anyone who was young and not
                    revolutionary. It just went without saying. It was part of the mystique of the
                    man. And he had appeared to be a man for all seasons and all political thoughts.
                    He had not said he was coming back as a religious leader and as ruler of Iran.
                    He was coming back to retreat to Qom and to give spiritual advice to people. He
                    wasn't coming back to be a government. He did, in fact, return and take over the
                    government, but no one could know that. Even his followers may not have realized
                    he was going to take over. It took him many, many months to consolidate his
                    political power, and that started to turn many younger people off, Mujaheddin,
                    Fedayeen, other groups like that. But in the beginning, when he was still being
                    brought back, and when he was just arriving in Teheran or Iran, he was not...
                    all the younger people were for him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Tabriz when the Shah left and Khomeini

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Shah left, and there were small parades and demonstrations on the
                    street, lots of people going around and shooting guns up in the air saying, you
                    know, “Long live Khomeini!” “Death to the Shah!” - that sort of thing. And lots
                    of people passed by the consulate during that. My own guards at the time were
                    Kurdish who were very upset and angry. But it passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were upset and angry at the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were very pro-Shah, personally pro-Shah. And they couldn't
                    understand why he had left. In fact, they had a confrontation at the gate with a
                    group of demonstrators who were there to say “Death to the Shah.” They had a
                    confrontation at the gate and were about to open fire. I stopped it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting anything from the embassy as this
                        developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, there was nothing. The embassy was caught up in its own problems. I
                    had been given a choice. Long since, I had been told by our DCM that I could
                    leave there whenever I wanted, and that I should head for the Turkish border and
                    not come back to Teheran. I had told him that I would stay in Tabriz until I
                    could get my prisoners out of the Tabriz prison. And he understood that. I just
                    felt responsible for these American prisoners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had four Americans, two West Germans, an Austrian, and an
                    Australian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were students, basically, from Europe who had smuggled cars into
                    Iran in order to sell the cars to a car gang there. And it was easier for
                    foreign students with foreign passports to bring them in than for Iranian
                    students. So they used foreign students to bring in the cars. And they were in
                    prison for close to a year at the time, getting on to a year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What was I doing for the prisoners? I'm not sure if we talked about the
                    prisoners before or not, why they were in prison and the fact that it was the
                    police that were actually doing the car smuggling.</p>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened was on one day in the spring of 1978, I had the
                    inspectors arrive in Tabriz to do the inspection of the consulate. My mother and
                    father had just arrived on a visit the day before. My cousin and her fianc� were
                    arriving that day, the same day as the inspectors, and I also had house guests
                    from the embassy. The whole group got together. We were sitting in the living
                    room of the consulate having lunch, and I had a phone call from the police
                    saying they had just arrested two Americans. I went down with the... You know,
                    one of the inspectors wanted to accompany me. We went down to the police
                    station, and indeed, there were two American boys who had been arrested. They
                    had been picked up because their passports looked strange. We looked at the
                    passports, and it was quite clear that something had been scraped or deleted
                    from the passport. And I started to talk, and they immediately started talking
                    about the whole story, how they had answered an ad in the paper in West Germany,
                    and had agreed to drive cars in a convoy back to Iran. They were paid, I think,
                    $200 apiece plus their road expenses, and they were going to be given tickets to
                    leave Iran at the end of their trip there. They got to Iran; they turned over
                    their passports and the German cars they had brought in to a dealer at the
                    Teheran airport, and then instead of getting on a plane and leaving quickly,
                    they decided to cash in the tickets and they were going to go back slowly by
                    train. Well, unfortunately for them, the customs people at the border of Iran
                    and Turkey weren't clued in to this little gambit and had stopped them when they
                    were doing a customs check because the passports looked funny and sent them back
                    to be questioned by the police authorities in Tabriz, the nearest big city. And
                    they ended up in my lap. And it was clear what was happening. They had brought
                    in cars, smuggled them in. Even though they would not have called it smuggling,
                    every else did, including their lawyers. I went back, got rid of the inspectors
                    the next day - that was fine - and sent the letter, actually, the draft of an
                    article, to the Stars and Stripes newspaper in Germany suggesting they run it to
                    stop other Americans from getting involved in this scam. I was, of course, in
                    touch with the embassy. The Stars and Stripes ran the article, said it was a
                    warning from the American consul. It did not stop a couple of other Americans
                    from getting involved and getting arrested the same way. And the other Europeans
                    and the Australian I mentioned. They were in jail, unfortunately, during the
                    very time that the revolution was brewing. And there wasn't enough interest in
                    the prosecutors to really investigate this crime. Also, things were starting to
                    collapse, and bits and chunks of the justice system were falling down, falling
                    apart. It was like pieces of an old building. There were so many people being
                    arrested in the demonstrations that the fact that there were a couple of
                    foreigners, a couple of Americans, in prison meant nothing. There were massive
                    political problems going on in the country, and also, as I found out later in
                    the year from my police officer friends in Teheran, the real reason the police
                    weren't investigating this was that it was the police that were behind the
                    crime.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These would have been the Shah's police.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Shah's police. It was a great way to make money. And my friend, who
                    was not involved, knew some of the people who were. It was like an open secret
                    in the police force. What was happening was that if you bought a foreign car in
                    Iran, the customs and duties levied on the car were extremely high. You'd pay
                    100 or 200 per cent more than the value of the car. So if you bought a
                    Mercedes-Benz that cost $15,000 in Germany at the time, then you would pay at
                    least that amount. Thus, a $10,000 or $15,000European car came to $20,000 or
                    $30,000 or even more in Iran. This made cars extraordinarily prohibitive, but
                    Iranians, who were status-conscious, wanted foreign cars. The police in the
                    traffic division had access, of course, to records about which cars had entered
                    the country and had customs duties paid on them. They also had access to the
                    records which showed which cars had been destroyed in automobile accidents. Now,
                    they put two and two together fairly quickly and realized that once a car was
                    destroyed, it was wiped off the books. Customs was no longer due on that car,
                    since the customs had already been paid. So they got lists together of high-end
                    cars which had been destroyed but which the customs duties had been paid on by
                    the owners, and they started ordering similar cars - make, model, year - from
                    Germany. For example, white Mercedes-Benz from 1974, four-door sedan,
                    Mercedes-Benz 2000 - whatever. They would order these cars from car dealers in
                    Germany, had them brought in. The had front men, of course, who would take the
                    cars from the students who brought them in. If a foreigner used his passport to
                    get a car in, the fact that he had the car would be stamped on his passport and
                    then he was given a certain number of days or weeks to take it out of the
                    country or to pay customs on it. Now they were bringing these cars in as
                    tourists so they wouldn't have to pay customs. They would turn them over in the
                    airport parking lot to a front man, who would also take their passports and with
                    varying degrees of skill, remove the marks in the passport which indicated the
                    person had a car. You could do this skillfully, or you could botch the job. By
                    the time my four Americans and the four Europeans were arriving, Australian and
                    three Europeans, the person who was cleaning the passports for the gang was
                    botching the job, just sort of scraping things out of the passport and erasing
                    it, not doing a skillful job at all. So the eight people got picked up. The
                    police, on the other hand, weren't eager to investigate the ring because the
                    ring was them. Therefore, these guys were going to sit in prison,
                    uninvestigated, for the rest of their lives, and the police...</p>
                <p>Well, the revolution was also occurring. I was visiting them regularly, sending
                    my FSNs in to visit them, providing them letters, this that and the other thing.
                    One of them had a relative who was in the House of Representatives, who was a
                    congressman from Texas. One of them had a father who was an Army colonel in
                    Germany. The Army colonel's response, by the way, when I informed him that his
                    son had been arrested, was, “I showed my son the article you had written that
                    was in the Stars and Stripes, and he told me he was going to Iran to take a car
                    there and he told me not to worry about it - everything was taken care of. Let
                    him learn his lesson.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes in a fluid situation, foreigners... the consuls'
                        best ploy is that after everything has died down is to say, “Let's get these
                        guys out of there. They're a pain in the neck for you, a pain in the neck
                        for me. Why don't we just let them drift away?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I tried that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Saigon, I was letting people... I mean, I
                        worked with the prison authorities, they would send them to me, I would send
                        them on ships to work their way to the United States and tell them to be
                        sure to show up when the South Vietnamese authorities would call them for
                        their trial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I got one of them out like that. He was up in the prison in Baku, and
                    that worked. He got out on bail and was told to show up again for trial. He
                    never returned. The others were a problem. The jail in Baku, no one ever paid
                    attention to it, nobody even knew it was up there. It was a small town. One
                    could deal with the authorities there. The prison in Tabriz was a different
                    situation. It was very closely watched. It was filled with political prisoners
                    at this point. Everybody was looking at it and observing everything in it. The
                    prison authorities could not have released Americans and Europeans without a
                    hell of a lot of trouble ensuing for them. And also, the justice system, like I
                    said, was disintegrating around us. I realized nothing was going to get them out
                    when I went in to prison one day and... They were all, by the way, assigned to
                    the hospital part. I had gotten them into the hospital wing of the prison
                    instead of the main area. It was far more comfortable. But when they told me
                    that an old man had said to say hello to me, that he knew me and was in prison
                    with them in the hospital wing, and I said what's his name, they told me the
                    name, and I realized it was the uncle of the empress of Iran who was sitting in
                    prison, and the Shah was still in Teheran! When the Shah's wife's uncle is in
                    prison, you know things are really going bad for the authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, were you looking after the other
                        Europeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, sure. I had contacted their embassies immediately, had told them
                    what was happening. And sometimes the Australian would come in or the Austrian
                    consul, but basically I was looking after them too. I would go and visit them
                    and I'd call up the Austrian, I'd call up their embassies and tell them what was
                    happening. As the revolution got very hot and heavy, the prisoners got
                    themselves into a real quandary. Their rooms in the hospital wing were being
                    used by the Iranian prisoners as a place to store weapons. Yeah. And I knew
                    this, and all I could tell them was, “Don't tell the authorities. If you get
                    caught by the authorities, say you had no idea what was happening, that you
                    didn't know the stuff was there. They won't do anything much to you all,” and I
                    said, “If I turn this information over to the authorities, everybody in the
                    prison will know it was you who told me, and you'll get killed by the prisoners.
                    Just play it cool, live with it, there's nothing you can do about it, and this
                    government is dead anyway, it's going.” I also by this point - this is January
                    of '79, roughly - I knew the prison was going to be broken into. My
                    revolutionary friends told me they had plans to break into the prison. I had
                    done everything I could to ensure the safety of the Americans in the prison. I
                    knew that in times of revolution and prison breaks you can often get your
                    Americans out. It happened in Lebanon. It happened in other places. So I went to
                    the prison on what turned to be one of my last visits and said, “Look, guys.” I
                    gave them all small maps to my house that I had done. Each one had his own map.
                    I just said, “I will stay in Tabriz until you get out of prison. Once you get
                    out, don't join in the fighting, just get out the door as fast as you can and
                    get to my place, and then we'll get you all out of Iran.” Well, within a short
                    amount of time, the prison indeed was broken into. Four of them showed up at my
                    house that day. In their prison uniforms, uniforms that said “Tabriz Prison.”
                    And the other four showed up the next day, and I signed a receipt for them. They
                    were delivered by one of the local mullahs, who had found them wandering in the
                    streets and had kept them for one night and then arranged to deliver them to me.
                    Unfortunately, by that point it was impossible to leave the city of Tabriz,
                    because when the prison had been broken into, the city had gone totally crazy.
                    The armory had also gotten broken into. Everybody was running in different
                    directions. City officials were getting arrested. There was absolutely no law
                    and order. So we could not get on the highway in an official car with diplomatic
                    plates and try and get to the Turkish border. They simply stayed there with me
                    in Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To finish off that part, how did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>METRINKO: How did that play out? I had guards for couple of days from one of the
                    local mullahs, and then it got really bad because there was so much gunfire
                    going over the city. The compound adjoining the consulate compound was the
                    property of a family associated with SAVAK, the secret police. They were holed
                    up in that compound, a number of them, and they had a running gun battle going
                    with members of the revolutionary forces. So we had running gun battles going
                    over the compound for that day or two. We just basically kept our heads low,
                    stayed inside the house. We were stuck in the basement during this period. There
                    was fighting going on all around the city. The army had dissolved. The air
                    force, or course, had gone over to the side of the revolution, really over to
                    the side of the revolution, and so they arrested everyone else in uniform.
                    People were being arrested all throughout the city. Phone service was spotty. I
                    could not get through to the embassy. This is the time when the embassy had been
                    taken also, February 14th. And the only people I was in contact with - I had a
                    radio that allowed me to get in contact with the U.S. armed forces net in
                    Kuwait. I could talk to a military attach� in Kuwait. He was the only person I
                    was really in touch with for about two days or so. I knew that I was supposed to
                    leave and get up towards the border; I just couldn't do it. There was no
                    physical way to do it. And I think it was either February 14th or 15th, the
                    consulate was attacked by a group of guys in air force uniforms. They used their
                    G-3s, a sort of Uzi-type automatic, on all the windows in the consulate, so all
                    the windows went down. They arrested me and the eight former prisoners and took
                    us off to a new revolutionary prison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In the revolutionary prison we were put into a large common room with a
                    fair number of Iranian former officials. In fact, one of them I had known. He'd
                    been a contact of mine. He was a police official. And they were running kangaroo
                    court trials, trying people, and finding them guilty, and hanging them outside
                    the door. They would come in, call someone to trial, and hang him outside. It
                    was rather interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>What I had done, just as the windows came crashing down, I had been in the office
                    building, and I had seen these people jumping over the walls. As soon as they
                    jumped over the wall, I made a dash for a phone, got down behind the desk since
                    bullets were going over, dialed the phone and got the mother of a friend of
                    mine. This was probably the first time in the history of the phone system of
                    Tabriz that dialing once actually connected with something. I got this woman on
                    the phone, told her the consulate was under attack and to tell her son and her
                    son-in-law. I put the phone down, and the military guys got in, the new
                    revolutionary guys, got in at that point and arrested me and took me off to
                    prison with the other Americans and other Iranian prisoners. We were in that
                    room and watched people being hauled off for trial and hanging for pretty much a
                    day. Then my friends showed up and got us out. My friends had gotten to the
                    prison even before I had got there. They had searched it and not found us. They
                    had gone on searching because they knew what was happening. They were doing the
                    same thing to other people themselves. So they had a very good idea what of was
                    happening to me. They had then done a search of the hospitals, a search of all
                    the other holding areas, detention centers - and there were lots of them. People
                    were being hauled off and arrested all over the place. They had gone to the city
                    morgue. They had looked at the bodies. And then they tried it a second time
                    around, and the second time around, towards the end of the day, they found us at
                    the first prison and had a big argument with, of course, the new prison
                    authorities. These were all guys who knew each other. They had all been in these
                    street gangs during the fighting. It didn't mean they liked each other, but they
                    all knew each other and they all had their own revolutionary credentials. And my
                    friend got permission for me to leave. I refused to leave without the other
                    eight, so eventually he got us all and escorted us out. He took us first to his
                    family home and then back to the consulate, which he had been assured was in
                    safe hands and under protection. And I chose to go back to the consulate as
                    well.</p>
                <p>Well, unfortunately, we were delivered to the consulate, they left, and the safe
                    hands rapidly became unsafe hands again. When they left the Air Force showed up
                    once more and basically put us under house arrest. We were under house arrest
                    there for about a day, basically kept in chairs in the living room, not allowed
                    to talk to each other, not allowed to move. The guards who were holding us did
                    not know that I spoke Turkish. They thought I might speak Farsi, but I was
                    communicating only in English because I didn't want them to know I could speak
                    their languages. And a couple of them started to talk in Turkish about how they
                    would have to kill us but they would wait until all these various inspection
                    teams- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>I held that piece of information to myself. I didn't want to tell my other
                    prisoners because they were in a state, at this point, of jars of pudding, or at
                    least little bags of pudding. And by chance, someone who was obviously of
                    officer rank came in to do a walk-through quick inspection. As soon as he walked
                    in, I just took a chance. I stood up, said I wanted to show him something in the
                    back room, and before any of the other guards could say anything, I took him to
                    a back room and told him very quickly what was happening. I had to trust
                    somebody. And he looked at me and said, “Make a phone call.” First he said,
                    “Wait, I can't do anything right now.” He said, “Just play it cool for a little
                    while; I'll be back very shortly.” And he took me back, put me in a seat, and he
                    turned to the guards and he said, “I have to come back because he has to show me
                    something about the communications system here.” And he came back about 15
                    minutes later, took me into a room where there was a telephone, and said, “Call
                    your embassy.” I called the embassy. The embassy I also got in touch with very
                    quickly, again, surprisingly, because communications had been so bad before. I
                    got the ambassador's staff aide on the phone because the embassy was in the
                    middle of a massive evacuation at the time, told him very quickly what was
                    happening, that we were in trouble and needed help from the central government,
                    and they got somebody from the embassy to the prime minister immediately. In the
                    meantime, the officer who had allowed me to use the phone, took me back again
                    and had told me, “I can't do anything. We have to change the guard force. I have
                    to get guards that we can trust. It may take a little while. I can't do anything
                    until then because if I try to take you out now, they'll kill me.” So he went
                    and got in touch with a university professor who was one of the revolutionary
                    leaders. They came in and changed the guard force, just calmly, with guards that
                    they knew. Things got a bit more relaxed, and then I'd say that same day we got
                    the news that the plane was on its way, that the new prime minister's office was
                    sending a plane to pick us up, and they did send in a cargo plane for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they take you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Back to Teheran. It's quite funny, by the way, the professor who came
                    in and saved us, when I did the report on this I used the first part of his name
                    - you know, “Professor So-and-so,” Professor Rajai - and that was how I knew him
                    at the time. He later became far better known in the United States as Rajai
                    Khorassani. He was the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations for a number of
                    years. I don't think he's ever mentioned the incident in Tabriz. In the report
                    nobody would have traced it to him when they found it because I'd used a
                    different version of his name. But there he was, saving American lives. Of
                    course, he had a lot trouble here from our authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well, then, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened? I was not allowed to take any of the consular seals or
                    anything else. They had been in the house with me. That was taken from me.
                    Although I had the bag because I thought I was going to be leaving to go off to
                    the Turkish border, so I was taking the consulate seal. I had destroyed most
                    things - plates, seals, ribbons, etc. - but I had the one seal, and I think the
                    cold seal, too, from the consulate, that I was going to take with me. I don't
                    know why. A lot of good they were going to do me. One doesn't think. I had this
                    little bag with a wad of money and a gun, for example, though I didn't know how
                    to use a gun. That was taken from me before we got on the plane. Some of the
                    items eventually showed up here, by the way, in the United States, years and
                    years later - not the gun, but the consular seal. Somebody's mother, years
                    later, called up the Swiss Embassy in Teheran and said, “When my son left Iran
                    he left a box of things here in his room, and I've just gone through it, and I
                    realize there are some things that belong to the American Government. I don't
                    want them in the house. I just want to turn them back over to the authorities.”
                    And so they turned over the Tabriz consulate seals. Of course, all visas from
                    Tabriz were canceled immediately from that day, because the seal was no longer
                    in our hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The air force cargo plane took us back to Teheran. We were delivered
                    into an ambulance at Teheran at the airport, taken by ambulance to the American
                    Embassy. We arrived at the embassy, which was in the throes of a massive
                    evacuation. It had finally sunk in to the embassy staff that a revolution was
                    occurring in the country, and they had decided to order an evacuation. It took a
                    while. That evacuation was going on. I turned over my four American prisoners
                    immediately to the evacuation staff, and they were whisked out, and they left
                    Iran that day. They were given new passports, and that was it. They left Iran
                    and were taken back to Germany and processed out. That was those four. I got the
                    Australian, the Austrian, and the two West Germans back to their embassies. I
                    know the Austrian and the Australian left the next day on evacuation flights.
                    That was fine. I had always assumed the others had gone, too, the West Germans.
                    Months passed, and in the late summer... the embassy, of course, was open. I
                    stayed on at the embassy and started to work. Late summer, an Iranian friend of
                    mine, whose name was Shokrai, told me another story. He was from Tabriz and had
                    a German wife, and he had been in jail in Tabriz, too. He was the CEO of a major
                    factory there. He'd been put in jail by the revolutionary authorities and then
                    bribed his way out. Anyway, he called me and said he was in Teheran and could we
                    have lunch, and I went out and had lunch with him. He said, “I met two of your
                    friends in prison when I was in Tabriz.” And I said, “Who?” And he said the West
                    Germans. And I said, “Oh, they've been gone for months and months.” He said,
                    “No, they just left about a week ago.” I said, “What do you mean, 'about a week
                    ago'? I brought them here and took them down to their embassy and they were
                    going to leave the next day.” He said, “No, what happened was that they went to
                    their embassy, and they got in front of the consul general there and told them
                    what had happened to them, and he said, 'Where are your passports?' And they
                    said, 'We don't have passports. Our passports were taken from us when we were
                    arrested.' 'But you must have passports.' And they said, 'We don't have
                    passports. They're in the prison back in Tabriz. We've escaped from there. We
                    want to go back to Germany now.' And the German consul said, 'But I can't do
                    this. You must have passports. I can't just send anybody out of the country. I
                    want to see your passports. Go back and get your passports.' So they went back
                    to get their passports. They got re-arrested in Tabriz and ended up spending
                    that summer also in prison. Then they were finally released. My friend Shokrai
                    had met them because he spoke German. He was called in to translate for them
                    whenever there was a problem because, of course, they spoke no Persian, no
                    Turkish, only German and some English. And he said, “When they left Tabriz, they
                    told me they were going to go back to Germany and they were going to kill their
                    consul.” Personally, I hope they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, okay, so we're moving into March or so by this

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That was February when I got back to the embassy. Moving into
                    March...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>METRINKO: March of '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation at the embassy, and what were you
                        up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The situation was this. Khomeini was in Iran. The Bazargan government
                    was trying to pull its act together. The embassy had drawn down to a very, very
                    small number of people. I think at this point we were about 15 or 16 Americans,
                    and that included the Marine guards. There was almost nobody there. I had stayed
                    on, and I was now a political officer again, you see. I was having a great time,
                    actually. I had a nice office, a good job. I was supposed to be reporting on
                    military and police trends, various other things like the response out in the
                    provinces to the ongoing revolution. I went back to Tabriz and officially
                    received our consulate properties back to the American Government. It was an
                    interesting trip back. I went in there and was met by Iranian friends, and they
                    took me to the consulate, and the authorities there officially handed over the
                    keys - well, they didn't have keys as such, but officially handed over the
                    property. And I actually stayed in the consulate with the Iranian Revolutionary
                    Soldiers force. I slept on the floor with them for a couple of nights in my old
                    living room, since my old bedroom had become a stable. You know, just slept on
                    the floor with the guys in the guard unit. It was an interesting time. And
                    eventually, they also left, and we restored the FSNs, but we never reopened the
                    consulate. The FSNs would go there, and they cleaned the place up, but the signs
                    were down, and there was a big question about what we were going to do. We had
                    no idea, but it seemed unlikely we were going to reopen it as a consulate. That
                    was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you got, what was the temperament in Tabriz when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Everything was up in the air. At this point, of course, there was a bit
                    of coldness between the Azerbaijani Ayatollah, the Grand Ayatollah Shariat
                    Madari, and Khomeini. This was a period of everybody sort of not knowing what
                    they wanted to do. There were a thousand political groups in the country. There
                    were religious groups fighting with religious groups. Khomeini was in charge,
                    but he was in charge of sort of a political kindergarten where everybody had
                    scissors. There were constant demonstrations everywhere. There were constant
                    kangaroo courts. Various ayatollahs were going around the country having people
                    hanged. There were firing squads. There was trouble in the Kurdish area. There
                    was an uprising there. We were afraid there would be an uprising in the
                    Azerbaijan with the Turks. There was a lot of trouble down in the oil fields.
                    There was a strike going on down there. The Arab ayatollah in Khuzestan had been
                    arrested and sent back to Qom, where he died, as many clergy died that year.
                    Khomeini did a really great job with his religious rivals. He went through their
                    ranks with a sword. They died, of course, in the privacy of their own bedrooms,
                    of poison or other things.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>The embassy was slowly rebuilding. What we were doing in late February and March
                    was trying to find out where we were. We were getting property back. We were
                    going around hot-wiring cars and bringing them back to the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what “hot-wiring” is.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, because people assigned to the embassy and people assigned to the
                    military mission had innumerable cars there, and they had been abandoned all
                    over the place, abandoned up at the military parking lot, abandoned in the
                    embassy parking lot, abandoned here and there, the school parking lot or in
                    front of their houses. So we didn't have the keys. The keys were all sort of in
                    a mess. So one of the guys from the attach�'s office proved to be very adept at
                    just lifting the hoods of these cars and being able to start the motors by
                    putting wires together. And they hot-wired cars all over that part of the city,
                    brought them back, and we sold them. We had a used car lot in the parking lot of
                    the embassy and would call in car dealers. We would sell cars by the dozens, and
                    it got to be pretty interesting. We were getting rid of embassy property,
                    closing up the property. We closed up the consulates in Isfahan and Shiraz. We
                    got rid of the lease on the consulate in Isfahan. In Shiraz the property was
                    ours, but that was also going to go up for sale. Tabriz was still on hold
                    because it was such a massive property. But we were putting out feelers to the
                    new government and being received very warmly, I might add, by most members of
                    the new government. One of the jobs I did quite a bit of was to try and go up to
                    the old military properties and see about getting access to them or getting them
                    back. I got into the U.S. military hospital, for example. I was the first
                    American to go in there, with friends of mine from one of the revolutionary
                    committees. I went up to the old American school and helped get access there.
                    The funniest one, perhaps, was going up to the old base at Lavisan, which had
                    been taken from us. That's where the APO was, the commissary was, the food
                    stores, and many of the military offices were up there. That's also where the
                    household effects was for a large number of military who had packed out in the
                    year 1978. Their lift vans were up there in storage, because nobody had been
                    able to ship things out of the country in the latter part of 1978. The whole
                    compound had been seized. And actually a rather funny incident happened when I
                    went up there to get access. The guy who was in charge of the Revolutionary
                    Guard group on that base was the younger brother of a good friend of mine, so I
                    had talked to my friend, the brother of the commander, and he and the prime
                    minister's office had told them that we were going to come up there, that
                    somebody from the American Embassy was coming up to inspect the premises. Now,
                    there was a philosophical problem here because the revolutionaries felt that all
                    agreements signed by the Shah with foreign governments or with anybody were null
                    and void. They were not binding because they had been signed by an illegal
                    government. That's the way they felt. On the other hand, they specifically did
                    not want Americans to take over things like military bases or large institutions
                    again. At the same time, their own military was telling them, “We need American
                    assistance. All of our weapons, all of our helicopters, all of our planes are
                    provided by the Americans. We need American cooperation in getting repairs done
                    and getting more supplies down the road.” So there were different philosophies
                    at war here. But to make a long story short, we had gotten permission from the
                    prime minister's office to enter the Lavisan military base. I went up with one
                    of the army tech people from the embassy and two visitors from Germany who had
                    come in from... I want to say Ramstein... to inspect the commissary, the APO,
                    things like that, to see what damage there was because we were talking U.S.
                    military facilities. All the arrangements were made. We were supposed to get up
                    there around one o'clock in the afternoon. Fine. We drove up to the base, and in
                    front of the driveway, going into the military base, there was a long chain, and
                    there were revolutionary guards standing outside. I got out of the car, walked
                    up to them, explained who we were. I was being very polite. They told me to get
                    screwed. I explained again who I was and that this had all been set up by the
                    prime minister's office and by Mohammed Reza, who was the commander of the
                    military group inside, and I knew he was waiting for me. Again, they basically
                    told me to get screwed and to leave. I went through the whole thing again. I was
                    getting a bit angry at this point, of course, but they had guns, and I wanted to
                    get inside. Finally, one of them - I guess he was their commander - agreed he
                    would go in. What I had said was, “I don't care if I ever see the inside of this
                    place. I really don't care about it at all, but your commander is waiting to see
                    me. If he knows, and he'll find out, that I have been here and wasn't allowed to
                    see him, he's going to be angry with you, not with me.” So what happened is that
                    the young commander went inside, came back about 10 minutes later - and all this
                    time I was standing out under a very hot Teheran sun - told me that I could come
                    in myself but that the others could not. I explained that I wasn't the
                    spokesperson, I was just the translator that day, they were the ones that knew
                    about this stuff. He said it didn't matter, that Mohamed Reza would only see me.
                    I went back to the car, explained it to them, they said fine, see if you can get
                    us access. I walked up to the chain across the driveway. The chain was hung at a
                    height which was exactly too high for me to put my foot over - I couldn't have
                    done that - and too low for me to crawl under. I wasn't about to crawl on my
                    hands and knees in front of the Iranian Guard. And I was standing on the outside
                    of the chain. He was standing on the inside, and in a very crude way he said,
                    “Hurry up,” but using the tone of voice and the grammatical expression that you
                    would use for a child or a dog or someone very much your inferior, in Persian.
                    My anger hit boiling point. I walked over to the end of the chain where it was
                    looped around a hook, took the chain off the hook, walked back along the length
                    of the chain so that I had the long length of a chain hanging in my hand, took
                    the chain, and whipped it across his face. He fell on the ground, dropped his
                    weapon, and I walked over him towards the building that I knew the commander was
                    in. I think probably at that point the other Americans in the car had heart
                    attacks. I had just had it. I don't know why I did that. But I did it, and I
                    heard him scrambling up, and I heard the gun scraping on the asphalt, and then
                    he ran up right behind me and started in Persian saying, “I'm really sorry, Sir,
                    excuse me, Sir, please forgive me, Sir,” and I just looked at him and said,
                    “Hurry up, I want to see Mohamed Reza,” and just walked in. And for the rest of
                    the day the guard whose face I had whacked with the chain just kept saying, “I'm
                    really sorry, I was showing bad behavior,” etc., “Would you like to come to my
                    house for dinner?” and “Please, I'd like to show you hospitality.” But I guess I
                    was reacting... I'd been a schoolteacher in Iran for three years. He was acting
                    like the worst of my students who were looking for a beating, and I always knew
                    that... Unfortunately, in Iran, if you're dealing with young guys and you want
                    them to show respect, you often have to physically hit them. It's a sort of a
                    sick society in that sense. So I just used a chain instead of my fist. It was
                    more effective, and it worked. Today I would not do that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In fact, if I had had 30 seconds of thinking and the sun had not been
                    so hot and I had not built up my anger to that pitch, I wouldn't have done it.
                    But I did it, and it worked. And we got into the building and established a
                    working relationship, and from then on the military was allowed to go in and
                    start removing things like money and their records and the medical records and
                    other things that they had to get out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a beginning of developing a cooperation with the
                        military, showing them how to run the helicopters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There was very much a beginning of a relationship with the military.
                    The relationship with the military never quite stopped. Soon there was a
                    winnowing out of the military. Some of the old generals had been secret
                    revolutionaries and now were in good graces with the revolutionary government.
                    There were also colonels who had dealt with Americans in the past, and a lot of
                    them spoke English. Maybe they didn't like dealing with the United States, but
                    we sort of had the monopoly, and they had to deal with us. And a lot of the
                    relationships were not bad at all. I can think of all sorts of military
                    officials I knew who had stayed on, usually at the colonel rank. The generals
                    went pretty quickly, and the generals who were not actually arrested found it in
                    their best interest to leave the country because so much was happening that you
                    could not predict the future. As an example of that, what was happening in the
                    country, my former landlord from Teheran, when I had been in the embassy for
                    about six months before going to Tabriz, was one of the general directors of the
                    Teheran electricity department, and somebody had issued a warrant, and the name
                    on the warrant was “general director of the agency for electricity.” Now it
                    could have been used against any of the former general directors. He found out
                    about it, immediately contacted a good friend of his who was the new
                    revolutionary prosecutor general and said, “Hey, what's going on? You know that
                    I'm okay.” And his friend told him this. He said, “Look, I know you're okay, but
                    I can't do anything about that warrant until you and the others get arrested and
                    your file gets to me with your name on it. Given the number of people we've
                    arrested already, it might take several months before your name and your file
                    comes across my desk. Then I can dismiss the charges. Until then, anything could
                    happen. If they catch you and put you in prison, you could be executed and I
                    would never even know about it. So I suggest that you not allow yourself to be
                    arrested.” So my friend, like many others, simply disappeared, went into hiding.
                    They went to stay with distant relatives no one knew. They went to stay in
                    smaller towns, other places, or left the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, at your level, were you making contacts with
                        revolutionary committees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Of course, all the time. I became quite friendly with the family of the
                    Friday prayer leader of Teheran. I knew them. The Imam Jumeh - that was the
                    title - the Imam Jumeh of Teheran was the highest ranking religious figure in
                    the city of Teheran. He was the one who led the people of Teheran in the Friday
                    prayer, a sort of mass public prayer, and he would lead two million, three
                    million people in prayer down at the university campus. His office was right
                    around the corner from my house. His sons and other members of his family would
                    visit my house at night. I dealt with that committee all the time. I got to know
                    them very well, did a lot of social stuff with them, let them come to my house.
                    My old Iranian friends would show up from Tabriz and Khorramshahr and other
                    cities. They would stay with me in Teheran. I was out, I think, socially, every
                    single night for the whole time that I was there, I mean from February until
                    November, when the embassy was taken. I was out every night or had friends over
                    at night, and the spectrum of contacts was all up and down, everywhere, every
                    direction - clergy, this, that, police officials, army officials, this official,
                    that official, merchants, friends, teachers, doctors, anything you could
                    mention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you reporting on? I mean, what sort of a
                        revolution was this, as the time developed? I mean, we're moving up to the
                        summer and the early fall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Up to the summer and the early fall. Well, the spring hit. They called
                    it the first spring of freedom. They continued to execute large numbers of
                    people. The prisons were crammed. So former Shah officials, other people, police
                    officials especially, army officials who had taken part in the martial law
                    regime were being arrested. Many of them were being executed. Khomeini went
                    big-time in for revenge. He had people arrested who had figured in his life
                    going all the way back to when he was young, people he hadn't liked. Other
                    people were doing the same thing. It was a time for taking economic revenge, for
                    getting more property, for making a grab for your neighbor's house if you wanted
                    to. So if you had clout with revolutionary authorities, you could enrich
                    yourself pretty quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a reflection of sort of Iranian society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Very much. I can give all sorts of examples. The mother of a friend of
                    mine was arrested and because of a neighbor's complaint. The complaint had
                    nothing at all to do with anything political. She was arrested because the
                    neighbors had revolutionary credentials and my friend's mother did not - she was
                    a housewife - the punishment was that she lost a large amount of money and all
                    the carpets from her house to her neighbors. They just wanted that. I read in
                    the newspapers that a particular village... There was a lot of fighting going on
                    in the small towns and cities still. And by no means did the revolutionary
                    authorities have full control of the country, especially in the border areas.
                    There was a small article in the paper about a particular village up near Ilam,
                    in the western part of the country, where revolutionary and
                    counter-revolutionary forces were still fighting. Now by chance, I had a house
                    guest for about a month, an American woman and her Iranian husband. Her Iranian
                    husband was from that particular town. I turned to him and said, “What's going
                    on? What does it mean, 'revolutionaries and anti-revolutionaries fighting in
                    your town'?” He said, “Oh, it has nothing to do with the revolution, Michael. My
                    oldest brother's wife has been jealous of one of our neighbors for the last
                    several years because our neighbor spent a large amount of money and built a
                    beautiful house. It's almost a villa. My brother's wife has been after my
                    brother for years to build a similar house for her. He's refused. He thought it
                    was a waste of money. Now that we've had a revolution, she finally got my
                    brother to attack the neighbor so that we could grab that house. It has nothing
                    to do with the politics of the revolution. It's my sister-in-law who wants the
                    neighbor's house, and she's going to try and get it.” Multiply that by a
                    thousand, ten thousand, or fifty thousand incidents. And I could go on and on
                    and on talking about things like this. The Pepsi-Cola factory in Tabriz was
                    attacked by marauders who set it on fire. It turns out that the people who set
                    it on fire were the workers from the Coca-Cola plant. They were both franchises.
                    Apparently the franchise holder of Coca-Cola decided he wanted to monopolize his
                    marketing in Tabriz. Multiply that. And this goes on and on and on like that. It
                    was a big power and property grab.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find, when you were at the embassy, was it sort of a new era of
                    looking at this? Were they -</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, initially it was a bit strange. Yes, there was a new era, but
                    there were still the old minds looking at it. Ambassador Sullivan became very
                    approachable, very pleasant, and very receptive to thinking - I mean, very
                    receptive to new ideas. He had had a shock, and actually, I have always thought
                    he was a good. He is a good ambassador. He was a good ambassador. He was just
                    the wrong person at the time, which wasn't his fault, and he was dealt a very
                    bad hand of cards by the White House. I think you could probably say that the
                    White House, the NSC, various people in Congress were playing fast and loose
                    with dealing with the revolutionaries. There were conflicting orders coming out.
                    I don't think the Secretary of State really was all that clued into the White
                    House at this point. I'm not sure what was happening, but certainly there were
                    conflicts going on between the military, private American oil interests, the
                    White House, some Americans on the various intelligence and other committees in
                    the Congress, the Senate and the House - they did not see, they didn't have any
                    sense of loyalty to our ambassador. They were dealing around him, behind him. He
                    tried to be a loyal soldier to the State Department. It didn't work then. He
                    became very approachable, very pleasant, etc., and very reflective once all the
                    panoply of our diplomatic presence disappeared around him. He was also confined
                    to the compound because he was so well known in the country that he couldn't
                    leave to go out in the streets. He had a group of local guards assigned to his
                    house, which made him almost a prisoner in his own house. It was an intolerable
                    situation. He put up with it with a great deal of dignity and grace, and in fact
                    put up with it for far longer than I think anyone else would have. He was
                    smuggled out of the embassy and sent out, left the country in secret. He went to
                    the airport in disguise, in an ambulance. Ambulances were the preferred method
                    of travel for security reasons. If you had to get out and about... ambulances
                    have no windows to look at the inside, number one. They can use sirens and go
                    quickly, number two. And no policeman is going to pull over an ambulance for
                    speeding, so you can speed and get out inconspicuously - not inconspicuously,
                    but there's a case where being conspicuous is your best way of keeping the
                    matter concealed.</p>
                <p>He got out of the country. Our DCM, who became the charg�, Charlie Nass, went
                    back and forth with the idea of should he go down and present himself to
                    Khomeini or not. As it turned out he never did, but that was the advice he was
                    being given by the revolutionary government, “not yet.” But we were dealing very
                    closely with all the members of the new cabinet, with the prime minister. We
                    were dealing with a number of important religious leaders, and we visited the
                    religious leaders. We dealt with everybody except Khomeini himself and were
                    dealing quite closely, both socially and professionally, and things were looking
                    more and more up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your contacts about
                        Khomeini?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't know if I can answer that question any more. As the summer wore
                    on, he had started the policy of women having to go covered. So the women were
                    having demonstrations. A lot of women were turning against him for that, but not
                    a lot of women in small towns, by no means, and not a lot of women compared to
                    the number of women in Teheran. Most Iranian women are quite happy and used to
                    dealing with that, and the issue was really sort of an American women's issue.
                    It's not particularly an Iranian issue. We made it a big human rights issue here
                    out of pure stupidity, gender stupidity here, basically. It's not that important
                    in Iran. But a certain type of woman was coming to stand against Khomeini. The
                    Mujaheddin, the other groups, were slowly losing faith in Khomeini. They weren't
                    being given what they thought they had been promised. They were starting to fall
                    away, too. The Tudeh Party he went after big-time. He went after the Communists,
                    and they were getting arrested and executed. So there was a problem there, but
                    of course he continued to execute people who had been very close to the United
                    States. There was, of course, a tremendous amount of hypocrisy in all of this,
                    and the people we were dealing with in the revolutionary cabinet were by
                    anyone's standards fairly dirty people. We were dealing with thugs, murderers
                    themselves. We liked them because they spoke English and were educated in the
                    United States and fought with us, and we were quite prepared to overlook all
                    their crimes, their ongoing crimes. It always struck me as a bit funny that we
                    could look in the newspapers and see on the front page the pictures of the
                    bodies of our former contacts - they would run photographs of the people who had
                    been shot by the courts - and that evening go off to some event where you were
                    meeting the killers and deal quite closely with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things that came up was that the
                        revolution was turning anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was not anti-Jewish at all. It never had been. It was anti-Israeli,
                    yes, because people in Iran, for lots of good reasons, thoroughly disliked
                    Israel. I mean, the Iranians are Muslims, the Iranian people. What they were
                    watching was an Israel that was committing horrible human rights crimes against
                    fellow Muslims. An Iranian religious person, if you were a Muslim, and you saw
                    that Muslims in Israel were having their land confiscated, were being sent to
                    prison, were being denied all sorts of basic human rights, why should you be
                    pro-Israel?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know because I got involved a little bit later in
                        granting refugee status, and one of the... It was really, of course, a
                        domestic political priority, but any Jew from Iran was going to be
                        persecuted, and they used the case of one Jewish businessman, I think, quite
                        - METRINKO: Oh, that case. I knew the family well, still know the family
                        well. As far as I recall, in the entire early part of the revolution there
                        were exactly two Jews who were executed, both of them for what the Iranians
                        saw as good reason. They were major business people who had been long-term
                        supporters of Israel, financial supporters. They were picked up and
                        arrested. They tried to bribe their way out. They might have gotten out
                        except so many people were being executed that they were also taken off and
                        executed along with a huge tranche of others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were considered “people of the book,” weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: People of the book, and the Jews had been living in Iran for 2500
                    years. I didn't feel any deep sense of anti-Semitism in Iran, at least not then.
                    But what happened was that it became... The Israeli Embassy, of course, it
                    wasn't designated as an embassy; it was called an interest section. The
                    revolution had been very pro-Palestinian. A lot of revolutionaries had received
                    training in Palestinian camps, so they were anti-Israel, definitely. There was
                    no reason for any religious Muslim to be pro-Israeli. In fact, there was every
                    reason to be anti-Israeli, if you were religious - every reason in the world. On
                    the other hand, there was no attempt made to go after the Jewish community in
                    Iran. The Jewish business people who were very prominent business people who
                    were involved in all sorts of projects with the government, big-time financiers,
                    supporters of Israel as such, yes, they got arrested, but so did thousands of
                    other people. And as a percentage, when you compare the two of them to the
                    number of Jews in the community there, I don't think it was particularly
                    significant.</p>
                <p>And one last thing I might mention, we had the case of one American senator,
                    Jacob Javits, who was the spokesperson against the revolution in the American
                    Congress. He went on and on and on, always taking the floor, talking about the
                    barbarians and the this and the that and “these murderers.” He was doing it for
                    a good reason. I understand that his wife was an employee of the Shah. She had a
                    contract with the Pahlavi Foundation and so basically the family was sort of
                    paid to do this by the Pahlavis. So he was acting as a shill for the Pahlavi
                    family as opposed to expressing what was accurate.</p>
                <p>Now, were they anti-Bahai? Yes. If you were Bahai, you were dead meat. But if you
                    were Jewish, no. Jewish per se, no; Bahai per se, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain why the Bahai were targets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Bahai religion started as a reform movement in the 1800s in Iran of
                    Shiite Islam. The problem with it was that it didn't stop at being a reform
                    movement; it claims that its major spokesperson was actually the last of the
                    Imams. Now, the Bahais accepted everything that had happened in Islam up until
                    the reform movement, and then they veered off. Traditional orthodox Iranian
                    Shiites and Muslims in general regard them as heretics because what they said
                    was, Yes, we have Muhammad, yes, the Shiites had and all the other imams, but we
                    have had a more recent one, who is the gateway, the path to God, etc. This made
                    them heretics. Their founders were sent off to exile and turned over to the
                    Turkish Empire, which sent them all to this most distant hell-hole for exile,
                    Acco and Haifa, on the Palestinian Coast. Now Acco is a delightful, beautiful
                    little town today. Then it was pestilential, malarial, etc., etc., and not a
                    place you would want to go. But the heads of the Bahai movement went there,
                    settled down there, and started to attract people from the region. There are
                    absolutely beautiful shrines. And the movement spread. It spread through the
                    clergy initially. The Shiite clergy have always had seeds for reform within
                    them. They do tend to reform themselves - that is, sweep out dead wood. This was
                    one of the movements that slowly developed into a real battle in which blood was
                    drawn between the orthodox Shiite clergy and the ones who had gone over to the
                    Bahai movement. That having been said, over the next hundred years, it went back
                    and forth, back and forth. Initially, the Shah had allowed pogroms against the
                    Bahais. There was a very famous picture of one of the Shah's generals, back in
                    the mid-'50s - standing on top of the dome of the major Bahai shrine in Teheran
                    using an axe to break in the tiles of the dome. It's a picture that was
                    infamous, of course, in Iran, but that general forgot his role, eventually
                    retired to the United States, and died quite peacefully here in an old-age home
                    about a year ago. And no one ever went after him for human rights
                    violations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what was happening with the embassy now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What was happening with the embassy? Slowly we were building up. We had
                    gotten down to about 14 or 15 people. The Marine guards were all changed. New
                    ones came in, and each officer- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, I was asking about how was the embassy
                        changing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>METRINKO: We had gotten rid of a lot of the embassy property. We had
                    consolidated. We had gotten rid of the old embassy-leased property. We were
                    really coming down to what was the meaning of an embassy, just a small group of
                    people performing services, doing reporting, and answering to the government.
                    When you say, “What was the embassy at this point,” I have to say, up until late
                    1978, the embassy compound had been a travesty. We had 25 acres of land. As far
                    as I remember it was 25, walled in, in the middle of the city of Teheran. We had
                    an American post office on the compound, a huge one. We had a commissary on the
                    compound, where people could do grocery shopping. We had a PX there so that
                    people could buy things like stereos and televisions, bedsheets, washing
                    machines, anything you wanted. And the number of people who could shop and use
                    the post office facilities was up in the high thousands. I understand that it
                    was 7,000 people. So imagine an embassy, which is really like a major shopping
                    mall, and if you will, imagine a place where many of the people using the
                    commissary and the PX were helping supply the Teheran black market. I was
                    standing once in line at the commissary, and the woman in front of me had just
                    purchased 85 sets of bed sheets. Now you can use 85 sets of bed sheets if you
                    own a motel, but not if you own a private house. She was going straight down to
                    the black market with them. She just walked in, and 85 pairs! And nobody even
                    blinked an eye. Many times when I'd be at my Iranian friends' homes in north
                    Teheran, and they'd pull out alcohol to serve, it would have one of the embassy
                    stamps on it because so much of the alcohol from the embassy was going right
                    into the black market, too. And people knew it. It was sort of a running joke in
                    the city that if you want something from the black market, it had to have been
                    imported into the country through the American Embassy. I completely fault the
                    leadership of the embassy at the time, certainly the military authorities there,
                    our military authorities. They knew this was happening. They didn't care, and
                    they made no efforts all, as far as I could see, to stop it. Now imagine the
                    presence of several thousand people walking in, shopping, coming out with bags
                    of alcohol in the middle of an Islamic revolution. Shoppers would come up from
                    Isfahan, from other places, by bus, and the buses, the women on it would be
                    wearing shorts, halter tops, they'd step out right at the embassy compound, do
                    their shopping, load up with alcohol, with beer, with all the other things they
                    were buying, and they could be seen doing this. As a presence, it was
                    disgusting, and to this day, I'd say that the people who took the embassy, well,
                    maybe we deserved it, because it was no longer an embassy. It was not the den of
                    snakes and the den of spies that the Iranians say it was. What we had turned it
                    into was some sort of a cheap shopping mall, and for that alone, that place
                    deserved to be shut down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time we're talking about summer or early fall.
                        This had gone.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>METRINKO: All this had gone. This had been removed, gone. The staff was far, far
                    lower, but slowly starting to build up. Now, what we had, this was the real
                    public face of the embassy. The Consular Section of the embassy had always been
                    located in a building about two blocks away from the main compound, a separate
                    building to which the public had full access. As the revolution got hotter and
                    heavier in the year 1978, this building had to close down. It was simply under
                    too much threat. The landlord had also told the embassy that he wanted to cancel
                    the lease. He no longer wanted to lease to the American Consular Section. Fine.
                    The embassy was in the process of locating a new place to put up a Consular
                    Section. And they had located a place right across the main street from the
                    embassy. In the meantime it's getting to be November, December. The revolution
                    is really getting hot and heavy. Most offices are closed anyway. The Consular
                    Section was closed down. It had to, except for emergency cases. It was not like
                    anybody was able to leave the country anyway. It was pretty restrictive at that
                    point for any Iranians to leave. Khomeini came back in January. People were not
                    traveling. The airports were closed. Iranians could not leave. The Consular
                    Section is still not open. Across the street the people who had given the new
                    lease to the embassy suddenly announced they were backing out of the lease. They
                    did not want the American Consular Section there. I think they were being warned
                    by revolutionary groups not to let the embassy lease that property. There were a
                    strip of buildings at the back of the embassy compound that had once been staff
                    apartments. They were something like townhouses. The embassy took those and
                    converted those into a consular section, but this took time. You can't do this
                    immediately. There were lots of people looking for workers and contractors, and
                    the middle of a revolution is not really the time to be able to do this well. We
                    were continuing to process emergency cases, and any of us who had any contact
                    with Iranian officials were getting deluged with passport visa requests from the
                    new revolutionary officials. What happened is that the Iranian Government
                    started to put pressure on us too to reopen. They were getting similar pressure
                    to reopen the passport office. The passport office in Teheran had closed down
                    for issuing Iranian passports. The passport office was reopened. The big
                    announcement went into the newspapers that on such and such a day the national
                    passport office around the country would be reopened. In Teheran, the office
                    hours are such-and-such. The reopened it, and so many people rushed the building
                    trying to get new passports that the building started to collapse. The floor
                    cracked. The support beams in the floor. And they had to close the building
                    down; it was condemned. They opened up a few days later at the international
                    fair grounds in an area which was all on the ground floor, sort of open pavilion
                    style, for the passport office. But apparently an astounding number applied for
                    new passports to leave the country. The embassy Consular Section reopened, and
                    within a very, very short time, we had similar lines around the embassy. I
                    think, if I remember correctly, that if you were coming into apply for an
                    appointment, if you wanted to see somebody about a tourist visa, to apply for
                    one, the waiting time to come in was about a year long. Now, the American
                    Government has a limited number of consular officers. We had a very limited
                    number who could speak Farsi, an even more limited number who were willing to
                    come to Teheran. There were a couple there, of course. They were doing their
                    best. But what they were being asked to do was impossible. The pent-up demand
                    was so high, in the millions, for visas that there was no way the Consular
                    Section could face this. So you had lines of people around the embassy that
                    stretched for two or three blocks, and a cross-section of society in the line.
                    You had mullahs, people in military uniforms, police officers, this, that,
                    people very well dressed, people in not such nice clothing, young or old, all
                    standing in line to get visas to go to America. And the revolutionary
                    authorities were pushing us all the time to give visas to their friends. Because
                    I had so many contacts in the revolutionary government, I was always getting
                    visa requests. As I found out, revolutionary authorities were making the
                    requests to help out former officials who had lost their jobs because of the
                    revolution. There were a lot of intermarriages, a lot of friendships, and a lot
                    of very strange visa requests were made.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I think I've always said that the sight of that line around the embassy may have
                    been one of the driving forces in getting the embassy attacked in November of
                    1979, just because it was so huge and it was always there as a sign that many
                    Iranians had not accepted the revolution.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: What I did, because I'd been a visa officer there before, I made an

                    two morning a week and just do interviews on the line. And when I went over
                    there, I would take over a stack of passports that I had been given by political
                    contacts and have them checked and issue visas then if they were good cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is often one of the currencies of an embassy, being
                        able to respond to visa requests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's sometimes the only currency. In most countries of the world,
                    there's absolutely no reason to talk to an American political officer. It
                    doesn't do you any good. What can you possibly get from an American political
                    officer except a request for information? And the consular officer is the one
                    who will get you your visa or does your paperwork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I was consul general in Seoul, Korea, and I hated
                        to go to cocktail parties because I would be backed into a corner by Korean
                        officials.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In Iran, if you went to a dinner party anywhere at any time, its
                    amazing how many people by a wild chance had their passports in their pockets.
                    You were not the guest of honor, you were the main course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were people, as we're moving up towards November, were any
                        of your friend saying, “You'd better watch out, this isn't going well,” or
                        something. I mean, were the signs good or bad? How were we reading the
                        entrails of these developments at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>METRINKO: There's a problem with reading entrails. If you're surrounded by
                    entrails all the time, you begin to take entrails for granted. If you only see
                    them once, you think, “My God, these are bloody!” We had gotten used to Iran. It
                    was normal to hear gunshots. We would hear guns going off all the time,
                    demonstrations going on all the time, puffs of smoke all the time, sirens all
                    the time, crowds of people running all the time. The newspapers were filled with
                    gore. Not the Gore that's running for President but the other kind of gore, gore
                    and reports of battles and reports of this and reports of that. There was
                    tension brewing with Iraq, and there was tension brewing with everybody, wild
                    speculation, wild rumor. We'd get stopped at night by Revolutionary Guards, by
                    the Komitehs. People had blockaded whole sections of the city, so as you went
                    from section to section you'd get stopped and checked. Nothing was normal, but
                    the abnormal became routine. In a war zone, especially those of us who had been
                    there through martial law from the year before, it was just sort of normal. We
                    were no longer fair judges of what was normal and what wasn't. So is the embassy
                    going to be attacked? Were we getting information? We were always getting
                    information that there was a threat, be careful, don't go there, etc. But at the
                    same time, I'd been hearing this for two years.</p>
                <p>Q: Now you must be getting new people coming in. I've interviewed - it's been a
                    long time - Anne Swift and some others who came in, and sometimes the new boy or
                    the new girl on the block sees things better than the person who's used to the
                    bloodiness around.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: They ask questions. But it depended on who you were listening to. If
                    you were listening to Iranian business people, they wanted American business
                    companies back. The banks wanted American businesses back. The franchise holders
                    wanted to reopen. The American military wanted to get back in. The Iranian
                    military wanted portions of the American military back, at least the supply and
                    logistic portions. It depended on who you talked to. Revolutionary officials
                    would talk about warming up the relationship, getting more support, getting this
                    or getting that assistance from the United States. This was going on. There were
                    people who hated us, yes, and they wanted us out, and they said so, yes, and
                    there were people who wanted us to stay, yes. It went back and forth.</p>
                <p>By that point I was no longer a fair judge of what was routine and what was
                    normal. I was so thoroughly involved in the really weird, bizarre daily life
                    that I didn't know any more. There was nothing routine. Strange things happened
                    all the time. You know, we just got used to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, one of the things that I think, and correct me if
                        I'm wrong, but I've talked to other people who've been involved in
                        revolutionary situations, particularly if they're a language officer and
                        particularly if they don't have responsibility for the whole bloody
                        community or something. I mean, they're having a lot of fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had a great deal of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you're running around, and you speak the language,
                        and you talk to people. Stuff's exciting, the adrenaline gets going, and all
                        this, and yet the person who's acting ambassador or whatever it is, he's got
                        responsibility for lives and everything else. So it's a different world,
                        isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was in the world of the language officer who was having a great deal
                    of fun because I was out with a lot of friends. A lot of my friends were
                    revolutionaries. They were in good jobs; they were moving up the ladder. I was
                    able to help a lot of people out. That made me feel good. The ones who had to
                    leave the country. And it was exciting. If you have political instincts, for a
                    political officer a revolution is like being in paradise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's better than any... It's a real rush, and it goes on 24 hours a
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to help any people get out, sort of sub
                        rosa, in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We issued a lot of visas using what used to be called the “Beirut
                    Philosophy.” Give them a visa now, even though they're running because since
                    they have property and ties to the country, they will probably come back when
                    things quiet down. And that was the logic I used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this has been used again and again and again,
                        including by some of these officers way back during the late '30s, of Jews
                        and others who were leaving Germany and all. Let's give visas now, and then
                        things will settle down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Exactly, and I think it's the way a consular officer has of sort of
                    melding the American law and our own sense of morality. You can use this in the
                    law and say, “Give them the visas, yes, and they'll come back.” The times are
                    temporarily difficult, but they do have ties here.</p>
                <p>Q: I did this after we had a bad earthquake in Naples when I was consul general.
                    I said, “Oh, issue them visas,” because you really didn't have much... The
                    Italians weren't leaving Italy in those days particularly, but they had to get
                    the hell out for a while. Mike, I think this might be a good place to stop
                    because we're really moving up to the hostage taking thing, aren't we? So I'll
                    put as usual at the end here that we've really talked about what you were doing,
                    so let's talk about sort of the endgame, shall we?</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The “endgame?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't know, the endgame or something. But anyway,
                        we're talking about moving up towards the November taking over of the
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we haven't talked much about some of the personalities
                        on our side. I think it would be interesting at the end to see some of the
                        officers you were working with. Were there any debates within the embassy?
                        How were we seeing things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Can I give one example that ties in here?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sure, why don't we do that, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: When you asked about what we thought was happening, the situation at
                    the time, I remember we used to write a weekly wrap-up of various incidents and
                    events that were happening in the city that didn't merit a telegram in
                    themselves but merited being reported in a large telegram - security problems,
                    this problem, that problem, what's happening with the military, etc. And I'd do
                    these every week, and one week the economics counselor had written his grand
                    thought piece on why the American companies should start to think about coming
                    back to Teheran, that things were really calming down, the business community
                    was all set, and it was time for the Americans to come back. We got a telegram
                    from the Department. The question was very simple. It said, the Department
                    refers to this, this, this, this, reporting on, you know, all of the disruption
                    in the daily life in the city and what's happening and compares it to such and
                    such a telegram. They are incompatible. Which is correct? And if you think, if
                    the post thinks that things are normal and calming down, and yet it's also
                    reporting the series of incidents that you've been reporting, it's not possible.
                    Please respond! They were right. We were in a schizophrenic world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'll put once again here, we'll pick this up,
                        really, would you say we've gotten about to the fall of 1979, and we'll talk
                        about what happened then, and also a bit about how you saw some of the
                        attitudes within the embassy from different people about what was happening
                        and all the debates within the embassy and all. And I also haven't asked
                        about what were we picking up from the field, since we had closed Isfahan
                        and -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Our consulates in Isfahan, Tabriz, and Shiraz were closed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were closed. Were we getting anything from that?
                        We'll pick that up next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 30th of June, 2000. Mike, we're really coming up to the early fall
                    of 1979. As the takeover of the embassy approached, in the first place, what
                    were we getting from the field? All of our consulates had been closed down,
                    hadn't they?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: All of the consulates had been closed down. We had FSNs still in
                    Tabriz. As far as I remember, we no longer had FSNs in either Shiraz or Isfahan.
                    What we were getting from the field was almost zero, consisting mainly of people
                    coming up who had been friends of the consulate principal officers. There were
                    only two principal officers left, I mean two former principal officers - myself
                    and Vic Tomseth - and so what we were getting from the field was very, very
                    slim, almost nothing. My friends would come and see me and tell me what was
                    happening in various towns and cities of Iran. I think some of Vic's friends
                    came up, too. That was it. We had no contacts outside of that. We had no
                    substantial military presence, we had no American presence to speak of, and we
                    had a few coming in from the field, so it was a vast unknown area out there,
                    except for newspaper reports, which were, as always, very unreliable in
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, looking over some of the people who were
                        players in the thing, like Bruce Laingen, some people in the Political
                        Section, Economic Section, and the Consular Section, were people sitting
                        down at the embassy, you officers sitting around and saying, “Hey, what the
                        hell is going on?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes and no. You have to divide the embassy in to two groups: the very
                    small group who spoke Persian and who went out and around the city, out and
                    around the country, and the vast majority of embassy officers who had no Persian
                    whatsoever or who only spoke Persian to get in and out of taxis and do a little
                    bit of shopping. The latter group, the ones who spoke no Farsi, or Persian, were
                    limited completely by what English-speaking Iranians would tell them. This is
                    not only true in Iran at the time; it's been true throughout diplomatic history.
                    If you don't speak the language, you're blind, or you're deaf, a combination of
                    the two. I can't speak for anyone else there at all. I know that people did
                    attend social events. I think I was out every single night of the spring,
                    summer, and fall. Right up until the day the embassy was taking on November 4th,
                    I was out all the time. I had a lot of Iranian friends. I made a lot of new
                    Iranian friends. I had good contacts in the revolutionary circles and good
                    contacts in the anti-revolutionary circles, and I would simply go out and often
                    stay out all night long sleeping in someone's house instead of coming back to my
                    own house.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what I gather was that during this period - and
                        sometimes there's a revolution and the revolution happens and the new group
                        of people take over - but this was rolling revolution, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was rolling because, number one, we reported it as rolling but it
                    was rolling because people kept getting assassinated or kept falling off the
                    bandwagon or falling off the rushing train, if you will. Khomeini had come into
                    power promising not to come into power. He had come back to Iran and had
                    promised that he would go down to Qom and be sort of a spiritual mentor and that
                    would be that. Instead, very quickly, within a short time after his arrival, he
                    left Qom and came up to live in Teheran and effectively was in control of the
                    country. Various government members, government ministers, well, the bureaucracy
                    of Iran... Governments run by their bureaucracy. Armies, armed forces, police
                    forces run not because of the general or the commander at the top or the senior
                    executive. They run because of the bureaucracies or the normal people who
                    actually carry out and implement bureaucratic actions. The bureaucracy, by and
                    large, stayed in place, but began to be purged. So people who had been well
                    known as royalists, people who were well known as having been corrupt or
                    bribe-taking or whatever, or too pro-American or too pro-Western, were quite
                    rapidly purged from the system, but this took weeks and weeks and sometimes
                    months. A lot of higher officials, of course, were under arrest, and the arrests
                    spread. More and more people were picked up. One would be arrested or confess or
                    would certainly give a statement, and that would lead to the arrest of other
                    people. So this was happening too, but it meant that the government offices were
                    changing all the time. If a new minister came into power, he of course would
                    bring in his friends. They would also bring in their friends. It was sort of a
                    running crapshoot. And people did get assassinated. There were a fair number of
                    assassinations of revolutionary government officials at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of ecumenical assassination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were ecumenical, the assassinations. I can think of one or two
                    ministers who were assassinated at the time. We had a group - not we, but Iran
                    had a group - called Forghan or Forqan, which was apparently a far-right Islamic
                    clerical group bent on assassinating people it didn't approve of in the clergy.
                    There were various high-ranking Shiite clergymen coming out and either trying to
                    be moderate or complaining about the excesses of the revolution - not about the
                    revolution per se, but about various directions in which it was going. You had
                    people like Bazargan, the insipid, silly prime minister, complaining that he
                    couldn't even run his office because the Revolutionary Guards were arresting
                    people from his staff while they were sitting in their offices. It was true. But
                    this was happening all over the country, too. You might be the governor of a
                    province, but you didn't know if you own staff was going to be there necessarily
                    the next day. The guy could be under arrest, or your brother-in-law might be
                    under arrest, or your sister or your wife. And so the country was lurching along
                    like this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the pattern of the arrests? Was it ideological,
                        or was it getting kind of personal and who owed who money and -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a combination of the two, but the personal played as much or
                    more of a role than the ideological did. Lots of people were arrested because
                    someone felt that they could be milked like cows for their money. And it had
                    nothing to do with their devotion to Islam, their revolutionary credentials, or
                    whether or not they had been pro-Shah. They were often arrested because of a
                    property grab. In Tabriz, for example, I think I mentioned that the Pepsi-Cola
                    plant was attacked. It turned out the people who did it were the Coca-Cola plant
                    employees. Fine. I had a friend whose mother was arrested in a spurious property
                    dispute because the next-door neighbor claimed that the wall or something had
                    been put in the wrong spot 20 years in the past. And it only ended when my
                    friend's mother, to get out of prison, had to give up a significant amount of
                    money, all of her carpets, and a lot of the household furnishings to the
                    next-door neighbor. I had an Iranian friend staying with me who was from a small
                    village in Ilam Province, way out in the west on the Iraqi border, and while he
                    and his wife were staying with me (they stayed with me for about a month because
                    they were getting green cards to go to the states), I noticed an article in the
                    newspaper about his village, saying that revolutionary and counterrevolutionary
                    forces were having a fight there and that the battle was ongoing. I showed it to
                    him and asked him what was going on, and he just laughed and said, “It has
                    nothing to do with the revolution or religion. This is my sister-in-law.” His
                    father had been the headman of the village. His brother had inherited the
                    position, as sort of clan leader for the area. And he said, “My brother's wife
                    has been staring at a neighbor's house for the last 10 or 15 years. She's
                    jealous of it because it's a much better house than she has, so she's finally
                    convinced my brother to try and get the neighbors' house away from them. It's
                    really just a grab at a person's house. It has nothing to do with the
                    revolution.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, I would have thought that you would be a little
                        bit like Typhoid Mary, going out every night as an American.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, a lot of the Iranian revolutionaries wanted to become close to the
                    United States or to Americans. I'll give you an example. We had a car full of
                    American diplomats, some of the younger officers who had just arrived at the
                    post after February. It was one day in the spring. They were out going
                    someplace. Their car got stopped by a Revolutionary Committee group, and they
                    were all taken to the station house. Well, they called me because I spoke
                    Persian. They got in touch with me, the Iranian guys who had arrested them. T
                    talked to them. They eventually all got out. They were released, and it was all
                    done very quickly, but the commander of the group said that he wanted to talk to
                    me. And fine, I thought it was going to be a protest about, you know, American
                    anti-Islamic activity or something. I agreed to see him the next day. He came
                    and was absolutely delightful, pleasant, invited me to dinner at his house. I
                    ended up going to his house about two days later, and when I was there, I asked
                    him why he had harassed the Americans? And I said it was simple. He said, “I saw
                    a group of Americans in a car, and I wanted to get to know some Americans at the
                    embassy. I didn't know how else to do it.”</p>
                <p>Q: Let's move up. You know, there's often a divide. I've witnessed it myself. I
                    served in Saigon, and certainly in these oral history I've done and all and just
                    knowing nature. You have relatively junior officers in an embassy or in a fluid
                    situation, who in a way are having a great time - they're speaking the language,
                    they're going out, they're fooling around - and then you have the more senior
                    officers who've got Washington on their neck telling them what they should do,
                    how to do it, they're trying to deal with the government. And pretty soon you
                    see a divide opening up between the younger officers and the officers with - I
                    hate to use the term, but it's correct - more responsibility for American
                    relations with the country there. And the officers who've got the responsibility
                    begin to look like clods, while the young officers, like yourself, are out
                    running around having a great time, seeing what's really happening. But was
                    there any connect between these two groups?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't think we had that much of a divide there. We had a divide
                    between certain individuals who saw the revolution in different ways. The senior
                    leadership for quite a while was Charlie Nass. Charlie Nass was the DCM and the
                    charg�. He had the most open mind of any Foreign Service officer I've seen. He
                    would entertain any suggestion, any recommendation, any new ideas, think about
                    it, come back with an answer that was almost invariably correct. It might be
                    unpleasant, but it was correct. He had been there for - good gosh - at least a
                    year before. He had gotten there, I think, in 1977, late '77. And he had seen
                    both governments. He was great. There was no divide there. He had the most
                    responsibility. Because we're talking about this period, I'm already saying
                    Ambassador Sullivan was gone and thinking in those terms, Sullivan's role for
                    the time that he stayed after Khomeini came back was quite limited. He never
                    left the compound. He couldn't go out. He was too well known. And so he was
                    there, but quite a bit in retreat, trying to patch things together, tie the few
                    loose ends and then leave. Charlie Naas was there for a much longer period. The
                    political counselor would have been Vic Tomseth. There, too, you had somebody
                    who had been t here for both Irans, both pre-revolutionary and
                    post-revolutionary. He was not slow, but he made decisions carefully.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Methodically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Methodically, thank you. And well. And he had the experience to back it
                    up. He was neither pro- nor anti-revolution, or if he was, he never displayed
                    it, very measured, very methodical and precise and good. The political officers
                    who came in, Anne Swift and John Limbert - Anne brought a tremendous amount of
                    experience from other posts, absolutely excellent, great sense of humor about
                    what was going on, which really made a lot of difference in the office. John
                    Limbert had lived in Iran for years and years before. He spoke excellent
                    Persian. Again, a very measured, sort of almost humorous approach to all this,
                    and no problems there either. There was no great raging debate in the Political
                    Section. In the Economic Section you had some differences of opinion. The
                    economic counselor thought that things were getting better all the time, as
                    opposed to the Political Section, which was saying this is a day by day thing,
                    you don't know what's going to happen, we hope it's going to turn out. But the
                    Economic Section really thought that every thing was getting nice and rosy and
                    American businesses could come back. That led to a number of problems inside the
                    embassy because the reporting was a bit contradictory.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: He came in because Walt Cutler was supposed to become ambassador, and
                    Walt Cutler's name had been submitted for agr�ment, but they turned him down.
                    They either turned him down or refused to accept him. I don't know why. I no
                    longer remember. It may have been a reaction to Javits. It may have been a
                    reaction to something like that.</p>

                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I think it basically was that, because they didn't know... The
                    government in Iran, while its various members, the various cabinet members, the
                    various top people in the government, were playing footsie with us and trying to
                    things for their ministries, trying to get visas for their friends, trying to
                    get services, trying to deal with the United States to get American business
                    back or to deal with American businesses - the government as a whole had not yet
                    come to a decision. And it may have also been much like today's Iranian
                    government, where the individual components want to deal with America, but
                    they're all afraid to say it out loud, in public.</p>
                <p>We had that. We also had a very large and very vocal anti-American group of
                    revolutionaries out there who wanted the relationship broken, who were afraid of
                    an American-Iranian relationship, so they weren't about to allow or to tolerate
                    any warming up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were Iranians who had been students in the United States
                        in this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Of course. To come to the United States as a student doesn't mean you
                    will like us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In fact, just the opposite, oftentimes. You have to remember that a
                    fair number of revolutionary government ministers had also been students in the
                    United States. It did not make them good people or learned people or intelligent
                    people. It was just a fact in their lives. One or two of them at least had
                    American citizenship. That's not much of a source of honor for the United
                    States.</p>

                    had in the State Department or in the White House a clear view of where we
                    wanted to go with Iran at this point. I really don't know about that. I can't
                    answer that.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: That's true, and it may have been true at a certain level in the State
                    Department, but on the other hand, we had certain number of Americans who,
                    whether or not we like to admit it, were also speaking for the American
                    Government. I'm thinking of people like Kissinger and Rockefeller, Jacob Javits,
                    a variety of other congressmen and senators, who were either on the take or had
                    gotten such large amounts of money in their lives from the Shah that they were
                    trying to get us to remain loyal to the Shah.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And they spoke for the American Government as well. It's curious. A
                    former Secretary of State, he'll still have the title of Secretary of State,
                    whether or not it says ex- in front of it. And if you're avaricious and only
                    thinking of your own pockets, as many of them were -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there still, I mean, was there a feeling that
                        there was still Shah money floating around the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There was a huge amount of Shah money floating around the United
                    States, immense amounts of it. The Shah had gotten out, reputedly, a couple of
                    billion dollars. I don't know when Mrs. Javits finally left working for the
                    Shah, but she was working for him during that summer, certainly. We had one
                    former ambassador who had set up a consulting firm called Safir, which means
                    'ambassador' in Persian. There's a good book, Paved with Good Intentions, by
                    Barry Rubin, about the Iranian-American relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, this is Barry Rubin, who has never been to Iran. He writes on the
                    Middle East. But his first chapter in the book he lists all the former
                    high-ranking American officials who worked for the Shah after they left
                    retirement. That included a number of military, former generals, etc., former
                    ambassadors, former Secretaries of State. And he was absolutely correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our Public Affairs Section there? How were they
                        working at that time? What was their approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't think I have the answer to that. They were active, that I know.
                    Certainly the Iran-America Society in Teheran was very active. They had an
                    office there. English was still important. It was still operating. I'm trying to
                    think. It was not the time or the place to give your exhibits or to publicize
                    the United States. You just hoped that you wouldn't do anything too wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Consular Section - who was the head of it, and
                        what were you getting, as a political officer at the embassy, from the
                        Consular Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Consular Section, even when it was closed, was extraordinarily
                    active and very, very hardworking. Lou Goeltz had been the consul general
                    throughout the revolution. Ward Christiansen had been the consul general up
                    until the early summer of 1977. He was replaced by Lou Goeltz. Lou Goeltz was
                    there until the middle of 1979. Lou was replace by Dick Moorfield, all three of
                    them excellent officers, all very hardworking in the classic sense of the
                    hardworking consul general who comes to work at eight o'clock in the morning and
                    doesn't lift his head up from the desk or from the crowds of people until six or
                    seven at night, and that's it. Their staffs were also good, and I could think of
                    so many of the consular officers who were really stand-out consular officers -
                    people like Barbara Scheil, who was killed in Iraq a couple of years ago, Tom
                    Dowling, for much of the revolution, people like that, just some really sharp
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Tom Dowling. Really sharp, good officers - hardworking officers, too.
                    And what were we getting from them? Well, the entire consular staff had changed
                    by very, very early in 1979. Khomeini came back, and almost the entire embassy
                    staff had changed. In fact, there were only a couple of holdovers. There was
                    myself, Vic Tomseth, Charlie Naas, who'd come in the middle of the summer, two
                    of the military guys - that was it. Most of them had not been there beforehand,
                    so everyone was changing new. All of the vice-consuls were brand new. The consul
                    general was new. His deputies were new. And they did not yet have, that early on
                    in the game, after a month or two months of being in Iran, the breadth of
                    experience or the command of the language to really become useful reporting
                    officers. (End of tape)</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: By the middle of 1979, I had already been living in Iran for five and a
                    half years. My friends were Iranian. My social life was Iranian. My eating
                    habits, my sleeping habits, my daily routine were totally Persian. There was
                    absolutely no reason why I should have or would have simply hung around the
                    embassy or had, other than work life, any sort of life with the people who were
                    coming into Iran now.</p>

                        there to report and convey, to present the American side of things,
                        particularly at the junior level, or relatively - you're not that junior -
                        to report about what's going on, particularly to those who are then making
                        decisions, particularly including at the top of the embassy and to the
                        Department of State. And so I'm just trying to figure out how this was
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I was making a distinction. I did a lot of reporting. My
                    contributions were in the reporting, in the perceptions that I brought back, in
                    what I reported from the street, from my contacts. And I had no social life with
                    most of the Americans there because, basically, they had nothing to offer. They
                    were brand new to the country, and they were feeling hunkered down. They didn't
                    speak Persian, in general, and basically it would have been a waste of my
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a waste of time at one point, but also - and the
                        other point is - at least those coming from Washington would be letting you
                        know more about what's happening in your own country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, no, I don't accept that. The had no more concept of what was
                    happening in my own country than anyone else did. I kept pretty close touch with
                    that. I always take my vacations in the United States and in Europe, and in
                    later years, every year make sure that, when I wasn't actually living here, I'd
                    come back every year. I came back to the United States for about a month, a
                    month and a half, in 1979.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And by the way, on my trip back to the United States, I was so
                    thoroughly disgusted by the Department of State, that I only stayed there for a
                    day or two.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Nobody was interested, when I came back, in really talking. They all
                    knew “the Truth,” in the Washington sense. When I came back, the first day I
                    arrived, I was supposed to spend a couple of days TDY in Washington, go home,
                    and come back again a couple of weeks later. And when I arrived, I was asked to
                    go to a meeting that INR was sponsoring, and that was fine, but the meeting was
                    to discuss reporting, much of which I had done, on the security forces of Iran -
                    police reporting, what was happening with the old army, things like that. The
                    office director of the Iran Desk asked me to be certain to come to the meeting.
                    I went to the meeting, and as the meeting started, I was asked to leave because
                    I didn't have the proper clearances. This was the attitude of INR and CIA. It
                    didn't matter if you had just been there for two years, had come back fresh from
                    the field, and had done the reporting they were discussing. Since you didn't
                    have the clearances they thought you needed to sit in the meeting, they weren't
                    interested in hearing what you had to say. Probably Washington has always been a
                    bit like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think all of us who have served in the field, when you
                        go back to Washington, you're full of knowledge and information, nobody
                        gives a damn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Nobody gives a damn, exactly. They know the Truth, so why bother
                    asking?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is why I'm dwelling on this, about the passing of
                        information and knowledge - personal knowledge - on: it's very
                        difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's very difficult. In fact, it may be impossible. All you can do in
                    passing information and knowledge on is to train other people. You can't
                    really... We don't learn from other people's mistakes. We can learn from their
                    anecdotes, perhaps, but not from their mistakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is, in part, my little crusade with this oral
                        history program, at least to document some of this so people who come after
                        can read case studies back and forth and at least get an idea and have
                        little warning bells go off.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm willing to bet the one great lesson that we should have learned -
                    one of the great lessons - from the whole Iran experience was that religion
                    plays a major role in the lives of many other nations, much more than it does
                    here. If you really want to understand the political and economic and social
                    life of another country, you also have to thoroughly understand the religious
                    beliefs they have, how they see themselves, and the institutions that their
                    religious beliefs have brought into being. We ignored that almost completely in
                    Iran, for lots of reasons, but we thoroughly ignored it. We ran around
                    scrimmaging to try to find some cleric we could talk to when the revolution
                    finally dawned on us. And yet, having done that, having paid the price for that
                    complete lack of understanding of another country's religion, I'm willing to bet
                    that in most other countries we are still doing the same thing. We're certainly
                    doing it in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think one of the things, too, but on the other
                        hand, we come from really a highly religious country. I mean, the United
                        States has... Israeli policy is driven by the Jewish lobby plus others,
                        which is religious-based. Our stand on a lot of things comes out of what we
                        would call Bible-Belt fundamentalism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And yet I'm willing to bet that the embassy in Israel today has
                    absolutely zero contact with the religious establishment there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect they'd have much more, because it's -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They never did before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I suspect now they have or they had because -</hi>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're moving. Well, we get really sort of into November,
                        and was this a tidal wave that was predictable, or did this just sort of
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Was I just an increasingly high tide that kept getting higher and
                    higher and higher?</p>

                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It was more of a high tide. What was happening by September, October,
                    November was more and more street trouble, more and more demonstrations, a
                    feeling that, okay, we've had a revolution, now what? Why aren't things
                    improving? Why are things going from bad to worse? Why aren't companies
                    reopening? More and more people getting arrested, long show trials continuing, a
                    pent-up desire by Iranians to leave, the feeling that maybe the schools weren't
                    going to open after they'd been closed for so long. A lot of sort of aimless
                    wandering around by a couple of million school kids who didn't know if their
                    schools were going to be open on time or not, because they'd certainly been not
                    open for much of the preceding year, and revolutions are fine, but you still had
                    to get on with your life, and every one else in the world has gone on for
                    another year of schooling and they are one year closer to their degrees. You had
                    purges that were continuing. You had - I want to say insurgencies, but just a
                    lot of nationalist foment out in the provinces. Kurds, Turks, Baluchis, the Arab
                    provinces were all getting a little bit noisy - in fact, very noisy. You had
                    religious leaders and ethnic leaders in the provinces being attacked. The Arab
                    Ayatollah of Khuzestan had been put under house arrest at this point. One of the
                    Kurdish religious leaders, a Sunni leader, had been put under... no, they were
                    looking for him to arrest him. They arrested most of the members of his family.
                    You had this sort of thing going on. You had increasing dissension in the
                    clerical ranks in Iran itself - you know, the standard Shiite ranks - with at
                    one point, for example, Ayatollah Taleghani, the Friday prayer leader of
                    Teheran, disappearing in a state of indignation over something or other that had
                    happened. I think one of his sons or two of his sons were kidnaped at one point.
                    You had the Mujaheddin becoming noisier, people making demands and
                    counter-demands, and the press was a free-for-all. The press was attacking
                    everybody, all sorts of allegations, other people being arrested. It was really
                    very, very shaky. The social fabric of the country had been really blasted, and
                    it hadn't yet settled down again. People didn't know what to do or who to turn
                    to in the country.</p>
                <p>Now that being said, you had us trying to redo a relationship with Iran. We
                    wanted to send an ambassador there. All of this stuff about America not having
                    recognized the revolution is absolute trash. We had never closed our embassy. We
                    continued to provide services. We dealt with the new government on a very
                    matter-of-fact day-to-day basis. We had never actually gone down and paid
                    obeisance to Khomeini. The Russians had. Everyone else had. They would all go
                    down, hat in hand, sort of bow and pay obeisance and get blasted by him, and
                    then come back and - fine. We never had. We had been advised not to by the
                    ministers of his cabinet whom we trusted. (And God knows why we should have
                    trusted them.) We had reopened the Consular Section. It was under incredible
                    pressure, with long lines, thousands and thousands of people waiting to get
                    visas and other services. At the same time that our FSN staff was getting more
                    and more queasy, people wanting to leave, just to sort of take off, to leave the
                    country, to leave employment, to move to America, or to move somewhere else -
                    because they, of course, were under the same sorts of attacks that the American
                    diplomats were, under the same sorts of pressure, but they had no protection. We
                    had diplomatic status. They had nothing, and they could be hauled in and
                    questioned and threatened with impunity. In fact, more than one of our FSNs was
                    arrested at this point, and we had one senior FSN who spent quite a while -</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You can't distinguish between the two at this time because “official”
                    meant vigilante communities. It was not yet a government, the Government of
                    Iran, in the classic sense. It was composed as much of vigilante committees and
                    communities and groups -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Komitehs weren't they called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were called komitehs, yes, as a matter of fact - composed as much
                    of collections of these and of gangs as of ayatollahs at their offices - anybody
                    with a beard who claimed to be religious, as it was a government in the regular
                    bureaucratic sense. There was no sort of merit examination that made you a
                    member of a particular ministry. It was just that you had a gang of people and
                    had been attached to a particular ministry or were using the authority of a
                    local Friday prayer leader in your home town to go out and arrest people, but a
                    rival ayatollah might also have his own people going out to arrest people. It
                    was really chaotic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought of saying, Okay, now, let's just get
                        out of here, and let's just close down the mission - it's too chaotic - and
                        wait? Did that really come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had the staff to about 10 or 12 people at one point, and very soon
                    we built it up again. I don't recall anything special along those lines. It may
                    have happened, or it may have been considered, but I don't think it ever gained
                    any sort of acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, you weren't all looking over your shoulder
                        and saying, Boy, what are they keeping us here for? I mean, you weren't
                        picking up this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Everybody was there as a volunteer, so there wasn't that. And I've been
                    in other groups. I have been in groups of people in different places that sat
                    down and said, “We should not be here.” This was not one of those places. What
                    was happening was too important. There were too many possibilities; there were
                    too many opportunities. And no embassy that I can think of pulled out later.
                    Everybody had somebody there, and most ambassadors were there, too. It was a
                    major political event, but it was also a fully covered political event among the
                    press. You had newspaper reporters, journalists, magazine writers, and travel
                    writers, and this and that and various activists from all around the world
                    flying to Iran. It was sort of like a St. Patrick's Day parade every day of the
                    year. Everybody was there. So there was no real sense that we should pull
                    out.</p>

                        journalists - not just American but European journalists, maybe others -
                        were coming to you and saying, “Hey, Mike, take me out and let me find the
                        real people.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I would never have taken a journalist out with me. I talked to a lot of
                    journalists. Yes, there were journalists around, but I don't take journalists
                    out like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Iraq hover on the horizon as a mass, or not? I mean,
                        was this something that was coming up on our radar at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was certainly coming up on the Iranian radar, because in the classic
                    sense of the revolution, the Iranian revolutionaries were proclaiming a
                    revolution in Iraq as well. They were trying to foment one. The comments, the
                    speeches, that Khomeini made about Iraq and that other revolutionary leaders in
                    Iran were making about Iraq were extraordinarily inflammatory, and I would
                    assume eventually precipitated the Iraqi attack on Iran. There was good cause in
                    Iraq to believe that Iran was acting seditiously inside the country. Now,
                    whether or not there was anything military going on, there was so much border
                    stuff going on that it wasn't necessarily Iraq versus Iran; it was the people on
                    the border, who had always been border people - especially the Kurds along that
                    border causing trouble - not causing trouble, just wanting a piece of the pie
                    that everyone else was grabbing.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the Kurds - because you had served in a Kurdish area - how did the
                    Kurds fit into the religious setup that was developing in Iran?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Kurds in Iran can generally be three different religions. You have
                    Kurds who are Sunni, Kurds who are Shia, and Kurds who are Ahli - ali-haqq,
                    ali-el-lahi. It's a sect that's very strong in Kurdish areas that regards Ali,
                    the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, as being superior to the Prophet
                    Muhammad. Kurds might identify themselves religiously, or they might identify
                    themselves first nationalistically as Kurds. It depends on the Kurd you're
                    talking to and what his own background is. There were Kurds who were high up in
                    the government. I'm thinking of the first foreign minister, Sanjabi, who was
                    from the Kurdish Sanjab tribe. He didn't last long. He was never allowed to
                    enter his office building by the demonstrators who were outside of it. It was
                    quite funny, actually. He was proclaimed foreign minister, but he could never
                    get into his own office. He developed the very typical heart problems that
                    officials there developed, and he scooted off to the United States. But they
                    tried.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>The Kurdish religious leader - I want to say Sheikh Hossein Ghassemlu, but the
                    name is escaping me - was under attack by the clergy of Qom. He had disappeared.
                    There were Kurdish uprisings, if you will, or gang warfare. You know, when a
                    newspaper describes an “uprising,” I'm never sure whether it's a gang fight, a
                    clan fight, a clash between rival groups of smugglers, or just a lot of angry
                    young guys on the street. You never really know, but there was a lot of noise in
                    the Kurdish area, to the point where the Iranians Air Force was ordered to bomb
                    some Kurdish towns. The were ordered to bomb the city of Mahabad, if I remember
                    correctly, right in the middle of 1979. And there was fighting in that area. Now
                    a lot of the fighting may have been simply because people who had gotten stuff
                    from the Shah wanted to keep it and people who didn't have it wanted to grab it.
                    I'm assuming that was a lot of the problem. It often wasn't ideological, but
                    basic money and property, and armed guards fighting over it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting anything from the south? This might have
                        been Victor Tomseth's area more, but the Arabs, down in what I would call
                        the delta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was getting some stuff because I had good friends in the new
                    revolutionary government of Khuzestan Province. The mayor of Abadan was a good
                    friend of mine and I saw him fairly frequently. The new governor general of
                    Khuzestan Province was somebody with whom I dealt. I think we may have gone
                    down. I didn't, but other people may have gone down on trips to Khuzestan...
                    Were we getting anything from them? Not in a real sense, no. But we had never
                    really had good contacts in that province, Abadan, Khuzestan, the general oil
                    area. The National Iranian Oil Company had always been in close touch with the
                    United States, but a lot of the old people had gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other embassies? Was there, from your
                        perspective, much sharing of information, or was everybody off on their
                        own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There were generally attempts on their part to find out what we knew,
                    because most of them were too small to really be serious. For good or bad, the
                    United States tends to have monster embassies, supermarket-type embassies. Most
                    governments have “boutique” embassies, and if you are one of two officers at
                    another embassy, there's not much you can really offer to the United States.
                    Most of the embassies there were smaller embassies. We dealt quite a bit with
                    the British, I know. The British were not bad. They tended to speak the
                    language, and I certainly had fairly good contacts with the British Embassy in
                    1979. But most other embassies were small and insignificant; the Russians, of
                    course, we never dealt with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering. At that time, of course, they would have
                        been Soviets. Were we concerned about what they were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>METRINKO: In 1979, there was a great deal of concern about what was happening
                    with the old Tudeh Party, the old Iranian Communist Party. What the Russians
                    were doing in Teheran, the Russian ambassador had gone down to see Khomeini, and
                    as a matter of fact, the Russian ambassador was also the last person to meet
                    with the Friday prayer leader of Teheran, Ayatollah Taleghani, before the Friday
                    prayer leader died unexpectedly (and probably through assassination). But he had
                    had a long meeting with the Russian ambassador. The Russian ambassador left, and
                    he died shortly thereafter. The Russians were in contact with the clergy. They
                    were in contact with a lot of the people in the country. Of course, they have a
                    very long joint border with Iran. There's a lot of reasons for them to be in
                    contact. They have always had a very strong presence in Iran. The Russian trade
                    mission in Tabriz had, I think, something like 200 people in it, which was
                    pretty big for a trade mission. And they had rail connections and other
                    connections with Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, let's go to the events. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I might add, by the way, just one more thing about Russia. I'm saying
                    Russia, now -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep saying Russia, and I come back with we really
                        have to talk about the USSR, the Soviets, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Because we can no longer say USSR, of course, we're talking about times
                    past. There was also something that was quite significant for the Russians. And
                    this was very much a part of Iranian revolutionary policy. The Iranian
                    revolutionaries want to spread a revolution, of course. There was a strong group
                    of revolutionaries who saw the revolution as starting in Iran but extending
                    throughout the world. I've heard them talk about the “Islamic Revolution in
                    South America,” which I always thought would be a neat trick. But many, many
                    revolutionaries felt that they could start a similar revolution in the Soviet
                    Union. All of today's republics are filled with Muslims. There are Muslims all
                    over the USSR, and I know that officers were assigned by the revolutionary
                    government to Moscow in order to foment the Islamic revolution there, to start
                    getting in touch with - if they could find them - Muslim leaders, Muslim clergy,
                    just to start a revolutionary process going in the old Soviet Union. The
                    Soviets, of course, knew this as well, and I don't think... You'd have to talk
                    to a real Soviet expert about how the Russians felt at that time about the
                    Iranian Revolution. They may have been quite fearful of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, I mean, this is a turnabout. I mean, they
                        have been playing the Communist card around the world, and all of a sudden
                        somebody was going into what was considered their back door in Central Asia,
                        which was quite vulnerable - at least they felt it was vulnerable.</hi>

                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>METRINKO: And the Russians, of course, had marched big-time into Afghanistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes - well, not yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Or were marching into Afghanistan.</p>

                        December. But what about the events of November, now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, we had something that happened just before the events of
                    November. We had the prayer leader of Teheran getting assassinated. That caused
                    major problems in the city. It happened in October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A prayer leader being -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, the equivalent of a cardinal of a city if you were a Roman
                    Catholic. The Friday prayer leader is the person officially designated to lead
                    the faithful in prayer on Friday. Ayatollah Taleghani was a very respected
                    revolutionary ayatollah. He was the patron saint of the Mujaheddin. He was
                    probably as popular in Teheran as Khomeini was. He also had something else. He
                    had a group of eight or nine very, very revolutionary children. Khomeini had one
                    fat son who basically shadowed his father everywhere and didn't do much else
                    except to get involved in business deals. Taleghani had lots of lean, mean
                    children who were out doing revolutionary activity, as heads of guard groups,
                    other things. They were involved in the Mujaheddin. They were activists. They
                    went out speaking. Eventually, one of his daughters became a member of
                    Parliament. But it was a revolutionary family, as opposed to Khomeini's family.
                    The prayer leader - I say this based on what his own family told me, because I
                    knew them quite well - he came home from having had meetings at Parliament one
                    day - it must have been October of 1979. In his home he had one private meeting
                    with the Soviet ambassador, who left. The electricity around his house and the
                    phone lines went dead, and he shortly thereafter died. His security guard had
                    been involved in an accident just a day or two before and gotten himself a
                    broken leg. He wasn't there. His doctor wasn't there, wasn't allowed to get
                    there; they couldn't contact him. This was in the days before cell phones, of
                    course. And so the phone lines and electric lines were cut. The house was
                    basically sealed off. The guy died. The family told me that it was poison. They
                    were told not to have an autopsy. So one of the most powerful Muslim clergy in
                    Islam at the time, in the Islamic world, died unexpectedly and was buried in a
                    few hours, and the family was threatened with serious problems if they tried to
                    have an autopsy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: By the other clergy. The reason given, at least by the family, was that
                    their father had been opposed to the concept of “valiat-e-fagih,” the rule of
                    the jurisprudent. That's the name given to the type of the government that
                    Khomeini was setting up, where a clergyman would be in final ultimate control of
                    the government. And Taleghani was going to come out against this in public, and
                    so he died. That started a lot of problems because Mujaheddin and others who
                    really revered him - he had been their spiritual mentor - started getting
                    extremely nervous at this point. It sort of threw things up in the air again as
                    far as the clergy were concerned. It made it quite clear that no matter who you
                    were, what your rank was, what your revolutionary credentials were, you could be
                    done away with very quickly and nothing would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the finger pointed at Khomeini? I mean, was this
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Not at Khomeini. People talked about Beheshti and others, other members
                    of the clergy. Khomeini was still sacrosanct. Even though many people considered
                    him just a murderer, they weren't going to say it out loud, certainly not in
                    public, because if they had tried, his followers would have destroyed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Mujaheddin. At this point, what did that
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: At this point they were a revolutionary group with a great deal of
                    discipline. They were supporting Khomeini, supporting the government. You could
                    always tell the difference between a Mujaheddin-held building or a Fedayeen-held
                    building, as opposed to a standard old Revolutionary Guard-held building,
                    because the Mujaheddin and the Fedayeen were extremely disciplined, tough,
                    soldier-looking, military-martial-looking, as opposed to the Revolutionary
                    Guards and all the Komiteh people. And Anti-American? Yes. Pro-revolutionary?
                    Yes. And for the time being working with Khomeini.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the slogans and things that are going back and forth
                        all of this time, was anti-Americanism a major theme, or was this developed
                        later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It had been a major theme all through the revolutionary process,
                    beginning in '78. “Death to America,” “Down with America,” “America, Go Home,”
                    you know, “Carter does this and does that,” was constant - so constant that it
                    had lost all meaning to us. It sort of had the same resonance as a
                    bumper-sticker here does. You don't even read it. If you read it, you read it
                    for amusement value, not because it has any meaning to you.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, in going around, that the people who were
                        shouting “Death to Americans,” and your being an American, was there a
                        connect there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I found some hostility, occasionally, but in general I found more of an
                    interest in making my acquaintance very often so that they could get a visa. The
                    amount of hostility against Americans was often tinted with jealousy of America
                    or a desire to go to America. It was always mixed and never quite logical.
                    Iranians blamed America for a lot because they were unwilling to accept blame
                    themselves. They were unwilling also to accept responsibility. It all went hand
                    in hand. America was a convenient scapegoat for everything that was wrong with
                    the country.</p>

                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened November 4, 1979. I generally got into the embassy late
                    because I would go out every night. And when I went out every night, I would not
                    get home until 12 or one o'clock in the morning. There was an understanding that
                    I was going to be out every night. I was one of the few people that was going
                    out, but I was also seeing a whole wide range of people who were useful to the
                    embassy, for reporting or to get things done. The afternoon before the 4th - it
                    must have been the 3rd - I had been contacted by two of Ayatollah Taleghani's
                    sons saying they wanted to meet me the next morning at the embassy, would I
                    please be there. And I told them that I wouldn't be able to get there until
                    quite a bit later, around 11 o'clock or so, and they were insistent they had to
                    see me earlier in the morning because they were leaving the next day or the day
                    after to see Yasser Arafat and they wanted to talk to me before they went there.
                    And this was logical, knowing these two people, so I agreed to be there early in
                    the morning. I had a lunch set up with somebody who had just come in from one of
                    the Kurdish provinces, who had called me, an old friend, and I also had a dinner
                    set up with somebody else, dinner with the former mayor of Tabriz. I also had...
                    This is an aside into the Persian personality. The Taleghani son that wanted to
                    see me that morning, about two weeks before this, had gotten me to help with a
                    visa for a former university rector who was trying to leave the country for
                    several months so he wouldn't get arrested. And he had brought the university
                    rector to my house. I had talked to him. I had decided to issue the visas. I had
                    issued visas to the rector and his wife and their kids. And the rector had come
                    back with his wife to thank me in person and handed me a package, saying, “This
                    is from Isfahan.” The way the package was wrapped was in the same paper exactly
                    as a box of awful Persian candy I had gotten a couple of days before. In fact, I
                    had so many boxes of this... It's a Persian candy called gaz that's a very hard
                    nougat which will pull the fillings right out of your teeth, and it's covered
                    with cornstarch, which makes it both difficult to eat and sloppy. And I used to
                    pile it up on my kitchen table, give it to the maid, give it to the neighbors,
                    etc. Sometimes even to guests. It was sort of a torture food. You'd put it out,
                    and people would have to take a piece. Everyone knew they wished they didn't
                    have to. Anyway, it was one of those type candies. He had handed me this large
                    box. I put it on the kitchen table, thanked him. We chatted. I gave him his
                    passports, etc. He left. And a few days later, I had more guests in the house,
                    went to get some candy to put out on the table, ripped the paper off this and
                    discovered it was a beautiful sterling silver bowl. So I got very annoyed,
                    called him up (he hadn't left yet), explained that I could not accept the bowl,
                    thanked him for it, but that I had to give it back, and would he please send
                    somebody to pick it up. He was going to send somebody to pick it up at the
                    embassy, where I had left it wrapped up at the gatehouse, on November 4th. So he
                    or a member of his family was coming to pick up the sterling bowl. I was set up
                    for a meeting in the morning, a lunch in the afternoon, dinner in the evening,
                    etc. - all with either bona fide officials or former officials or wanna-be
                    officials. And I was in my office waiting for my friends to call. I noticed that
                    there was a tremendous amount of activity around the embassy. And that's when
                    the embassy started to notice it too, in general. The noise level had just
                    picked up considerably, and when we looked out we could see lots of heads. And
                    suddenly the heads were coming over the walls. And that was that. We grouped
                    people who were in the chancery building or could get to the chancery building.
                    When I got to the main floor, people were at the doors. I was already up on the
                    ambassador's floor, up to my office floor, people got up to that floor. And
                    then, it was a matter of battening down the hatches. We did not start to destroy
                    files. It was far too much to destroy anyway. I do not know what time the
                    communicators started, but I was part of the group in the ambassador's office, a
                    large group, some discipline, not a tremendous amount. The charg�, his deputy,
                    Vic Tomseth, the RSO, Mike Howland, were gone, so there was some confusion over
                    who was in charge. More and more noise outside. I picked up the phone at one
                    point because the phone lines were still working. We were on the phone with
                    Bruce Laingen, who was trying to give orders from the foreign minister's office,
                    saying Khomeini had ordered that the protest be broken up immediately and that
                    there were people on the way to help us, just to hang tight. We were hanging
                    tight, and it became clearer that they were going to have trouble getting
                    through because the crowds were really getting noisy and things were breaking
                    outside. I picked up the phone, dialed the number of my revolutionary friend who
                    had asked me to be at the meeting, and got his security guard, whom I also knew
                    quite well, on the phone. I told him I just wanted to speak to Mehdi, and he was
                    silent for a moment, and then he said, “Michael, Mehdi won't come to the
                    telephone.” And I said, “You know what's happening here at the embassy, where
                    I've been waiting for Mehdi to come.” He said, “Yes, we know.” And I realized
                    then that they had set me up to be there. So I just said, “Okay, I guess this is
                    goodbye.” And then he said, “Michael, I'm really sorry” (this is the security
                    guard), and that was that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened then, one of our RSOs went outside, despite
                    recommendations that he not do so, and then shortly thereafter he wanted us to
                    open the doors and let them in because they said they were going to kill him if
                    we didn't. He had gone out thinking he could talk to the mob of a couple of
                    thousand people, using mid-American English and no sense at all of Iran,
                    Iranians, or anything that was happening. He was going to go out there and, “I
                    am the American diplomat. You are breaking the Geneva Convention.”</p>
                <p>Q: He didn't have a swagger stick.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, he didn't have a swagger stick.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's like, what can you say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, you'd been through this... Well, maybe not you,

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I'd had seen it before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you'd had it before -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had had it before. No one else in the embassy had had it before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I thought there had been that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, February 14. That group was gone, with the exception of one or two
                    of the military, Colonel Lee Holland, and that was it. I think -</p>
                <p>Q: Was the general feeling of “we'll be taken, and then this will be taken care
                    of eventually?”</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, taken, and it will be taken care of because the government is
                    going to come back in and break this up again. And in fact, the captors, the
                    “students” - so-called - that had arranged all this, also believed it was going
                    to be a one-day event. They told us that at the time, some of the more pleasant
                    ones. They said, “Don't worry. You'll be in your own home by midnight tonight.”
                    And in later years, as they talked about it, giving interviews about it, they
                    still say that, that they had planned that this was going to be a quickie, just
                    to show the world that they could do it. And instead, so much solidarity cropped
                    up for them, then Khomeini suddenly supported them, that they stayed, and that
                    was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, let's talk about how you were treated and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: How was I treated? Well, I got singled out fairly quickly. I did not
                    tell anyone in the group, and they had no reason to know, at least initially,
                    that I could speak Persian. I had learned my lesson in Tabriz. You do not tell
                    captors your entire life story and what languages you speak as soon as you meet
                    them. In fact, you hope you can never tell them. We were taken to the
                    ambassador's residence first, held for a while there, kept tied up. Eventually,
                    as it came time for the... I guess the first evening I spent there. By the
                    second day, I was taken over to the cafeteria area, where they had mattresses
                    spread out on the floor. We were placed on mattresses, sort of forced to sit and
                    sleep on the mattress, and at one point the group of students walked in and went
                    up to somebody and started speaking to him in Persian. They were going from bed
                    to bed. One of my embassy colleagues blurted out, “I don't speak Farsi. Ask
                    Metrinko. He speaks Farsi really well.” And they came over and hauled me away,
                    and I never saw anybody again for many months. The fact that you're a Foreign
                    Service officer doesn't stop you from being an idiot necessarily. That guy was
                    an idiot, and I could cheerfully have killed him.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: But... Then that was it. I went to solitary, and they purposely tried
                    to separate the ones who spoke Persian and also the ones who were the heads of
                    offices in the embassy. That was that. I went to solitary on November 6th and
                    came out sometime in May for the first time, briefly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in solitary, you mentioned, what were they
                        doing with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Initially, for the first month or two, a lot of interrogation. Who do
                    you know? What did you do? Who did you talk to? Who said what to who? I had to
                    give them information about figures that were public revolutionary figures. I
                    knew this or that minister. I knew the deputy prime minister. I knew the head of
                    this office. I knew the head of that office. And I could talk about things like
                    that. But that was about it. And we'd just go on repeating and repeating and
                    repeating those questions. They weren't very professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, did you feel they had a dossier- (end of
                        tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were saying they would ask you -</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, first they ordered me to open up my safe in my office, and I did
                    that. If someone's pointing a gun at you and telling you to open up an office
                    safe -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It encourages one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It encourages you. Besides, the break-in time for one of these safes is
                    approximately three minutes anyway, so... I just saved them the trouble.
                    Luckily, I had very little in my safe, per se, but of course had a lot of stuff
                    written in other people's safes. They had my list of phone numbers from the
                    office, but luckily, the ones in the office were very, very standard
                    professional contacts - Ministry of Foreign Affairs people, other people, the
                    ministry's office numbers. And the ones in the house they had not gotten. I
                    found out much, much later, several years later, that a friend of mine, hearing
                    over the radio the news about what was happening at the embassy, had immediately
                    rushed to my house, gone inside, and removed every piece of paper to be found in
                    my apartment. It was somebody who knew my apartment well. All the paper that was
                    in the house, including lists of friends, not lists, but telephone numbers,
                    things like that, was removed from my house and destroyed. And that probably
                    saved a number of people's lives. It certainly saved a fair amount of discomfort
                    for people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it certainly also shows by this time that the people
                        who knew what was happening were well trained. This was not the normal
                        response of somebody who has not been involved in a revolutionary society
                        for some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were becoming very politically savvy. The friend who went there, I
                    think, went there assuming, as was correct, that his name was in the house and
                    wanted to make sure that he didn't get into trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was your impression of your interrogators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, very idealistic, not too bright, not bright in the sense of having
                    had practical experience - just sort of know-it-all students, people who were
                    sure that their point of view was the only point of view in the world and that
                    everything you may have done was wrong. But by this point I was used to that
                    attitude on the part of Iranians. I had already gone through the year and a half
                    of listening to similar people - and not well rounded, not well educated by
                    anyone's standards, and fanatic. That's a dangerous combination.</p>
                <p>Q: It is a dangerous combination. While you were in solitary confinement and
                    these things were happening, were you sort of preparing yourself, mentally, how
                    you would respond, sort of working out a game plan?</p>
                <p>Well, now, were they trying to extract information or were they trying to
                    indoctrinate you?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No indoctrination, no. They knew I was a lost cause. They were trying
                    to extract information, especially about revolutionary officials who they think
                    might have been collaborating with us in the embassy. So I think I must have
                    mentioned the name of every revolutionary official I could think of. “Oh, yes,
                    he was educated in the United States. Ha, ha.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, I guess this is sort of compensation. You
                        thought you were throwing, as the British say, a spanner in the works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was throwing them as many bones from their own ranks as I could
                    possibly throw up, and each of them had I met with. “Oh, I know the deputy prime
                    minister, yes... Khomeini's son-in-law, yes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're still talking about early days, and I guess
                        this went through several phases, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It went through several phases. I was initially kept inside the
                    embassy, taken from room to room depending on what they were doing with the
                    rooms. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in small, semi-closet area in the
                    basement of the embassy. Initially, when they had larger rooms, I would have a
                    guard who would sit there with a gun trained on me. I always thought that was a
                    bit stupid. Of course, they were also very careful. Gradually they stopped doing
                    that and just kept us locked in the rooms with guards outside in the hallways,
                    which was, of course, a lot more sensible. To leave the rooms to go to the
                    bathroom you had to blindfolded. The first time I got out of the embassy was
                    springtime, so from the period of November until roughly March or April I was
                    locked up in a room with no windows.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get by? I'm talking more about the mental
                        process and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I got by by doing a tremendous amount of physical exercise. When I say
                    that, I mean a really tremendous amount of physical exercise. I was doing a
                    thousand sit-ups a day. I'd run in place for two or three hours. And I would do
                    this all day long every day because I had to get tired enough to fall asleep.
                    Otherwise you don't sleep. Food was no problem. They always fed us, even when it
                    was only bread and cheese, the people were always fed. Hygiene was a problem in
                    the sense that, well, we had the embassy bathrooms to use. They were kept clean
                    because we cleaned them. I would volunteer for bathroom-cleaning duty just to
                    get myself out of my room. I never saw anybody else all that time. Occasionally
                    we'd hear a voice, and that would be that. Other than that, I could, much of the
                    time, probably three-quarters of the time that I was there, have books. And that
                    was fine. I would read, exercise, read for an hour, stand up, run in place for
                    an hour, or some sort of exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of books did you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, we had a small embassy library. They distributed that. Then they
                    had seized the old American High School, and they brought the contents of the
                    library down and dumped it, and they would give us books to read from that. In
                    fact, I still have two of those books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that this organization that was
                        going on was either changing in its composition or they were getting bored
                        with the whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were changing their composition because people would disappear
                    from the guard group. I know from the history that I read later, that they
                    purged members of the takeover group, that the Mujaheddin, for example, that
                    were involved in it, were rapidly thrown out of it or rapidly dropped out of it.
                    I don't think it was ever a Mujaheddin plot to take the embassy. There were a
                    couple of people who were in the Mujaheddin who were involved with it or took
                    part in it as activists, but I don't think it was a Mujaheddin plot to do this
                    at all. We know the leaders of this takeover group, and none of them have
                    Mujaheddin connections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, they're in power right now. Khatami, the great liberal hope of
                    the United States, has them all as his trusted advisers, which is something the
                    State Department refuses to think about, that his first vice-president was the
                    spokeswoman for the group - Mary Ebtekar - who likes not to think about it or
                    talk about it much today, but there was this great touting by human rights
                    groups and women's groups that said, “Oh, he's appointed a woman as his
                    vice-president.” Yes, she is. She was also one of the ringleaders of this
                    group.</p>
                <p>Other people closely tied to Khatami - in fact, the ringleaders of the student
                    group are all closely tied to Khatami today, which has always led me to question
                    what he was doing back then, and that's something that people simply refuse to
                    think about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, there's always the thing that, you know,
                        when you get right down to it, religion is religion, but politics is
                        politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And you hope that this is -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and where you stand is where you sit, and where you
                        sit changes from time to time. All you have to do is look at our political
                        leaders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, some of them are scumbags that make the Iranians look absolutely
                    pristine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when they got you, did you have to fight bitterness?
                        I mean, how the hell did the US Government get me into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I never blamed the US Government. You can't blame the US
                    Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sure you can.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I wouldn't. The US Government was us. I was the US Government. I could
                    blame myself for lack of prescience. I could look back and say, Gee, if I'd only
                    stayed in Germany longer on my vacation, I wouldn't be here. Gee, if I had only
                    gone off to such-and-such a place, I wouldn't be here. But you know, a
                    revolution is an act of nature. In fact, it would be the “perfect storm.” You
                    can't fight nature. A revolution is natural; it occurs in politics - not all the
                    time, but as a cataclysmic event which, when you're involved in it, you cannot
                    reflect. It was there. It's happening. You can lay back and enjoy it; you can go
                    with it, hope to survive it, but you can't stop it, and you can't sit back and
                    say, “Gee, if only I had done this,” or “Why doesn't my government do that?” I
                    knew my government. And I also knew all the various conflicting trends of
                    thought about how to deal with the revolution that we were going through in
                    Washington. I also had and continue to have very little faith in my government,
                    in the sense of protecting me. So I had no expectations that it would. I
                    remembered very, very clearly from junior officer training, we had been told
                    that if we were taken hostage, the government would not deal with the hostage
                    takers. It would do what it could, but basically we were going to be on our own.
                    And there would be no attempt to buy us out or to deal with hostage-takers, no
                    bargaining with them. Therefore, I was in that situation. I did not expect the
                    government to do anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, it was probably a relief in that it allowed you
                        to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That I didn't have to sit around and keep hoping. In fact, I kind of
                    expected - I mean I really did - that some day some American consul would walk
                    in and say he was the consular officer from the American embassy and was paying
                    a consular visit. I had that little faith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened in May, when they let you out - I
                        mean, not let you out, but they moved you around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened in May? May was when the incident in Tabas occurred, when
                    Americans were killed trying to rescue us in one of the most stupidly planned,
                    botched up military-political escapades of the season - unworkable, unwinnable,
                    and if they had succeeded, we would have been dead. So I'm really glad that it
                    ended in Tabas. It could not have gotten us out. But having said that... What
                    happened is that they came into my cell one day and said, pack your things,
                    you're being moved. Eventually I packed my things, and that consisted of putting
                    things into a little, tiny bag. I think I had an extra shirt, an extra pair of
                    underpants. I put them into a bag, and they came back to my room a while later,
                    blindfolded me, put sort of these heavy plastic restraints on my hands, led me
                    out, and put me in the back of a van, lying on the floor of the van. And there
                    were other people lying there next to me. We were not allowed to talk. And we
                    started to move. I was on the floor of the van, bouncing around for a couple of
                    hours. We got to a different place, and they led me out, blindfolded again, from
                    the van, took me into a building. Various doors slammed and shut and opened and
                    closed. You'd hear voices. And eventually, they sat me down, took off my
                    blindfold, took off my restraints, I looked around, and I was with two other
                    people in the room, neither of whom I recognized. We were, as it turned out, in
                    a former SAVAK prison in the city of Qom, and we had no idea who they were at
                    first, and it was the first time that I had talked to an American since
                    November. So it took a while to start speaking English again, which I hadn't
                    spoken since November, either. But when I found out who they were, fine. In
                    fact, I had met one of them a couple of times. The other one I had met, I think,
                    just when he was introduced at a country team meeting and never seen again. But
                    we lived together for the next month or two. I'm not sure how long I stayed in
                    Qom. I knew it was Qom. They didn't want to tell us where we were, but I figured
                    it out because I could hear a train in the distance the first evening, and I
                    knew that Qom was on a railroad track, and when I tasted the water I knew that
                    we weren't in Teheran any more. Water in Iran has very distinct tastes depending
                    on the city you're in. The water of Qom is infamous because it tastes like salt
                    water. It's very brackish. Tea and coffee made in Qom are almost undrinkable
                    because the water is so salty. When I had some water I knew immediately that we
                    had to be in Qom or somewhere near there.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Talked. I hadn't spoken English in so long I could hardly get the words
                    out.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: They had been in group rooms. They had each had a couple of roommates.
                    The told me about what had happened to various people they knew, various
                    incidents that had occurred, things like that, how various people were doing
                    that they knew of or had seen as roommates were changed, as cellmates were
                    changed. There were some people with whom we had no contact at all, nobody knew.
                    For example, at that point we did not know that Bruce Laingen and the others
                    were being held in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nor did we at that point yet
                    know that... I'm trying to think when I actually found out that people at the
                    embassy had escaped. I'm not sure how I found that out. I know how I found it
                    out; I never knew who they were. I found it out when I was reading the sports
                    page once, and they had given me the sporting news because it had nothing at all
                    to do with politics (and at that point I would read anything), and in one of the
                    articles it just mentioned, sort of way down in the middle of a thousand words
                    of text that guests of honor at the stadium in New York had been the Canadian
                    ambassador and the six or seven Americans he had helped escape from the embassy
                    in Teheran. And the crowd had cheered them etc. That was how I found out. I
                    always assumed, up until the very end when we got out of prison, that that had
                    been Bruce Laingen and Vic Tomseth, Mike Howland, and some of the others. I had
                    no idea who it was. I just assumed that they had gotten out of the Foreign
                    Ministry somehow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what happened beyond this? Were the
                        interrogations pretty well over by this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The interrogations were over, yes, except for one that I had later.
                    When was it? I guess I had one last interrogation a couple of months after the
                    others when they had gone through one of my reports and I had reported on a
                    conversation with someone who was a pilot for revolutionary officials, and they
                    had arrested him. They brought him in, and they had us in for a joint
                    interrogation in front of the hostage-takers' mullah, Khoeiniha. Khoeiniha was
                    the spiritual leader of the student group, and he was also a little bit crazy
                    then. He has become sort of a spiritual mentor for Khatami now. Now, of course,
                    he's a laid-back liberal. At the time, he was more obviously a total bastard.
                    Today it's no longer politic to be one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well... I tried insulting him, which I guess worked, and they
                    eventually led me away. He was a little bit crazy. He sat there the whole time
                    digging a fork into the palm of his hand. He had a sharp fork, and he was just
                    digging his hand down on the fork. This was bizarre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, sort of what was the endgame of this whole
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The endgame was lots of sitting around. And my roommates got changed
                    once in Qom, so I got to talk to somebody else. I heard about other people,
                    fine. We were then taken away from Qom - this was the time people were spread
                    out all across the country - brought back to Teheran, and originally to what was
                    called the Ghasr Prison or also was known by the name of the Komiteh Prison,
                    although it had nothing to do with the komitehs that were formed after the
                    Revolution. The Komiteh Prison was the name given to it a long time before. It
                    was a prison that had been built by Germans in the reign of Shah Reza. It was a
                    rather unpleasant prison, built as a real prison, the first time I was in a
                    real, real prison with prison cells and little apertures and no windows, just
                    apertures for air, which were always open. And you could hear screaming and
                    things like that at night where people were being tortured, because there were
                    lots of Iranians in prison with us at the same time. I met the former commander
                    of the prison, actually, whose son-in-law owns a grocery store here. I met him a
                    couple of years ago. He was visiting his son-in-law. Lots of Iranians come to
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was there, had a cellmate there. I was taken away from there up to
                    Evin Prison, went back into solitary. That was in Evin. I have no idea today how
                    many weeks or months I spent in each place. I once calculated that out of the
                    entire time I was, 14 months, I spent approximately 10 months in solitary. But I
                    went from there to Evin, got thrown out of Evin once and sent back to solitary
                    to a punishment cell there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It was wintertime in Evin. Evin is in the northern part of the city of
                    Teheran. It's very cold. My cell was excruciatingly cold. If you were just
                    sitting or standing, you can't warm up. I could sit there with a blanket around
                    me, but it was cold. It was below freezing, especially at night. We had no heat.
                    This was already after the Iraq War had started. But one day I was really,
                    really cold. I had been told that the guards also had no heat, that they didn't
                    have any way to stay warm either and there was nothing that anybody could do
                    about this. Conditions were harsh all over the country. Fine, I could accept
                    that, except one day when I was going out to the bathroom, they were leading me
                    out blindfolded, I brushed up against a stove that was on, a heater. And I
                    immediately knew it was a heater, and I just started to go on and on about Islam
                    and the bastards they were - they knew nothing about religion, and they were
                    liars, and what they could do with their imam, and everything else. They threw
                    me back in my cell, and a little while later a couple of the leaders of the
                    group came in - they were called in from the outside - and they said the guards
                    were refusing to deal with me any more because of my attitude, and they took me
                    back down to Komiteh Prison, at night in a car, blindfolded, and put me in a
                    cell, just on a concrete floor with nothing else for about two weeks. And I was
                    on bread and water for about two weeks. It was quite interesting. Then they
                    brought me back later to Evin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: How did it end? It ended when the United States, I guess, finally got
                    its act together. We had an election in the United States, which allowed the
                    Iranians an out. Do I believe that the release of us was delayed on purpose so
                    that the election would take place? Yes, I do. I also believe that some
                    Americans conspired in this. Yes, I do. I heard about it fairly early on, back
                    in '81, shortly after I got out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well, now, let's talk about the last days, or
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The last days? Let's see, it must have been... when was that... I'm
                    trying to think now. Where was I by Christmas? I guess in December... Yes, it
                    would have been December. I was still in solitary up in Evin. I was taken from
                    Evin to a building which... Oh, I might say, in Evin for the first time I got
                    see other prisoners. I was allowed to talk occasionally to Colonel Holland, Lee
                    Holland, who was in a cell next to mine. The would take me in there to sit with
                    him for a while. He had a slightly larger cell than I did. And that was fine. We
                    could sit and chat. And also they would take us out for exercise in the yard,
                    and we could see each other. They would let us walk in a circle in the yard just
                    to get fresh air, and I could see several of the people who were in the same
                    prison block that I was in. And it's funny, a friend - I think it was Anne
                    Swift, who was up in that prison block, too, as one of the two women left - her
                    reaction was exactly the same as mine. She was really, really glad to be able to
                    get the exercise finally, until she realized the group she was in with - and I
                    looked around and had the same reaction - I looked out and saw, hmm, the
                    military attach�, hmm, the head of Station - oops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they had pegged you as being -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Why aren't I with the lower-ranking ones somewhere? I'd rather not be
                    in this select crowd. But yes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of these groups that kept going over to Teheran,
                        various clergymen and the liberal do-gooders and all this? Did they -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The only one that I was allowed to see was Archbishop Capucci, the
                    Greek Catholic archbishop who had been the archbishop in Jerusalem for the Greek
                    Catholic Church, the Melkite Church, and had been put in prison by the Israelis
                    for gun smuggling and then been released to Vatican custody and was running
                    around dealing with a lot of revolutionary groups in the Middle East. I met him.
                    It was the second time I met with him because I had once stayed with him for a
                    full week when I was visiting Jerusalem back in the year 1970. I recognized him,
                    and he recognized me. He and I used to have dinner together every night for a
                    week in Jerusalem. When I was there as a tourist, I stayed in his small
                    monastery there. But he came. Other than that I wasn't really allowed to see
                    most of them. I was taken in for, I guess, the second Christmas, not with the
                    others. I was taken in privately, and I insulted the two clergymen who were
                    there, so they took me out again. I was being filmed, so I immediately started
                    with how could they deal with animals like this, and why were they pretending to
                    be Christians and the clergy, etc., when they obviously had nothing to with
                    Christianity. The got offended. I did my best to offend them. I was offensive on
                    purpose. And they took me away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were clergymen from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, I'm not sure where they were from. The Baltimore Roman
                    Catholic priest who came I never saw. He was met with universally bad vibes like
                    everybody who was there. And the only fitting reference I heard for him was
                    scatological, so not worth repeating. But other than that, the do-gooders - no,
                    I didn't see them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how did the release come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, we were removed, I was removed from Evin, taken to a building
                    which, as I found out later, was the former guest house of the prime minister.
                    They had put bars and sort of iron grates, not planks, large pieces of flat iron
                    or steel, over the windows, but the furnishings were all the original rococo
                    sort of “Louis-the-Bastard”-type French stuff that had been there while the
                    prime minister's guests were using it. It had an absolutely beautiful bathroom -
                    I'll never forget it - lined floor to ceiling with dark red marble. It was like
                    bathing in Caligula's tomb. But I was there with Dave Roeder, the Air Force
                    attach�, who had been my cellmate off and on. Dave's a good guy. And then we
                    started getting visits - Algerian diplomats, for example, and others. II
                    remember correctly, the Swiss also came in. I could be wrong about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were the protecting power.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, not saying very much, and they weren't supposed to talk to us
                    very much, other than to inquire about our health. And then we were all led, one
                    by one, over for a final televised interview with Mary Ebtekar, who is now a
                    vice-president of Iran. We didn't get along either. They never showed me on TV
                    because whenever a TV camera got trained on me during one of these meetings, I
                    would say things to make it impossible to show me. And she wanted me to say that
                    I'd been treated very well, we'd had a good time there, etc., etc. I told her in
                    un-nice terms to “buzz off.” But other than that, more and more visits. And the
                    guards were becoming “friendlier,” as in, “Gee, hasn't this been swell,” and
                    “Aren't you glad you're going home?” and “You'll be going home very shortly” -
                    that type of thing. I will say that one of the guards even gave me a copy of
                    Time Magazine or parts of Time Magazine, and that's when I discovered that
                    Ronald Reagan was now the President of the United States. He had been elected
                    President. And I immediately assumed it was Soviet disinformation. I did not
                    believe it. It just has to be disinformation - sort of a Mad Magazine version of
                    Time. And then, well, it was almost over. I had trouble over actually leaving
                    the guest house. And so I missed the ride out to the airplane. When we were
                    being put on the bus, I was led back to my seat, and I was trying very hard to
                    be correct because it was an important time. I knew I was in a bus because I
                    could tell I was walking down a bus aisle - you know, the sides of the chairs.
                    And I was put in a seat in the bus, and I could sense the bus was filling up. I
                    could hear them coming, bodies moving around. Two of the Americans behind me
                    started to whisper to each other. One of them said, “Where do you think they're
                    taking us? Are we really going?” Something like that. And the other one started
                    to reply, and one of the guards yelled out, “American, shut up!” And then he
                    said, in Persian, an insulting reference to Americans. And so in Persian, I
                    simply replied in a loud voice, “Shut up yourself, you son of a Persian
                    prostitute!” And they pulled me off the bus, and the bus left. And they beat me
                    up a little bit, and that was fine, except then they realized that they had me,
                    and I realized the bus had gone, too. It had been very stupid of me. I had just
                    been pushed. I reacted. And eventually they sent me out to the airport in a
                    Mercedes-Benz, which is actually the only way to leave Iran.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: It was fine, except I didn't know about half of them on the plane. I
                    had no idea who they were because I had never seen most of them, or never seen a
                    number of them. I was very surprised when I learned that Bruce Laingen was on
                    the plane. I thought he had been one of the several who had gotten freed by the
                    Canadians. I never knew that he was there, or the people with him. Other than
                    that it went fine. We went through Algiers back to Wiesbaden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In talking was there a sense of exaltation, or was there a
                        mood of bitterness - our government put us in this and they should have
                        gotten us out earlier? How would you characterize it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I can't characterize the mood of other people. I have no idea what they
                    were really feeling. I felt no bitterness at all. I'd never felt my government
                    would do anything. I had no expectations of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there also the feeling that if they tried to do
                        something it wouldn't work, that it could get very dangerous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I really don't know what other people were feeling. We didn't talk
                    about it. Everybody was caught up with saying hello, looking at each other, sort
                    of getting pummeled by the press, by the flashbulbs going off, the camera
                    lights, and then once we got to Wiesbaden getting in touch with family and
                    friends.</p>
                <p>Q: As far as you were concerned, did the Algerians play any particular role, or
                    was that at a higher level?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: We saw the Algerians a couple of times. Algerian doctors came in and
                    gave us medical examinations. That's when I first really started to believe
                    there was a possibility of getting out of there, because the Algerians explained
                    who they were and why they were there. Other than that, to the best of my
                    knowledge, they played a crucial role. We could not talk to the Iranians
                    directly; we needed the Algerians, and the Algerians played a good role. They
                    had the credentials, and they had the trust of both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they treat you when you got to Wiesbaden?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Wiesbaden was sort of interesting. They were trying to keep us under
                    wraps. The State Department was very good. They had a lot of security. They
                    really did not want us to do anything except to go through a battery of
                    psychological tests, because I guess there was a lot of fear that we were all
                    bonkers. And they wanted us to take tests, which, of course, I naturally refused
                    to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought you would play it the other way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I looked and I walked out. We don't have to do this. But other than
                    that, they treated us quite well. They herded us around. They took us here, took
                    us there, took us to the commissary for new clothes, got us our medical tests,
                    our dental tests. And I took off for about a day. I left Wiesbaden and went off
                    touring with friends. The State Department didn't want me to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Why did I go off?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, what was the reason the State Department wanted to
                        keep you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A bit of background. When I got to Wiesbaden, I had messages from a
                    couple of hundred people - telegrams, phone messages, everything else - piled up
                    under my name, and there were some rather strange messages there. But one
                    message was from two American friends who were working in Germany. In fact, in
                    October of '79, I had spent a week with them on a vacation, and they just said
                    they were still in Germany, welcome home - all of this - and could I give them a
                    call. So I called them up to say hello, and they asked me if I'd like to go out
                    for dinner and do some touring. And I thought this was a great idea because
                    otherwise I was going to have to sit in the hospital for a couple of days, and I
                    didn't want to do that. So I went and told the head of security there, whom I
                    knew, the American from the State Department, that I wanted to leave the
                    hospital and I'd be gone for a day or so. And he said, “You can't do it. It's
                    not allowed.” “What do you mean, it's not allowed?” He said, “You can't do it.
                    You can't leave the hospital.” So I just looked at him and said, “I am leaving
                    the hospital. You can help me or you can try to stop me, but if you try to stop
                    me, I'm going outside and telling the press that you're keeping me in prison.”
                    And he decided he would help me. And so my friends came and picked me up in the
                    basement, and we went off and I had a great time for a day. It was
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your reception when you came back to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Do you mean the official reception by the Department of State, or do
                    you mean people of the United States?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean both.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: People in the State Department were very, very careful of us. They
                    didn't quite know how to handle us. They wanted to make sure that nobody did
                    anything or said anything strange or that would reflect badly on the State
                    Department - which was fine, it's the standard old, you know... They had done
                    their best in a miserable situation for which they were not really prepared, and
                    they had really done a lot of work. And a lot of people had put their hearts and
                    souls into this. In fact, they had done too much of that. Too many people had
                    become emotionally involved, and perhaps the most difficult part of all this was
                    dealing with other people's emotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose on your part there was a certain amount of,
                        well, let's get on with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Exactly. I mean, I was, Okay, I'm back now. You didn't pay me for
                    weekends. You didn't pay me for overtime. I'm back. But the State Department was
                    very antsy. I was asked once more if I would do the psychiatric exams, and I
                    refused. I saw no reason to do this. That was fine. I took some time off. In
                    fact, I took quite a bit of time off.</p>
                <p>Oh, debriefings. I found this fascinating. The State Department never really gave
                    a damn about debriefing us. They never did. They simply did not care. I don't
                    know if it was that they didn't care or that they didn't have the intellectual
                    interest or they had already gone forward in policy matters and they decided
                    they did not want to know. I think it was that.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I don't know. I talked to people who have been in difficult times - not,
                    obviously, what happened to you, but other times - you know, people in embassies
                    under fire or very difficult times or just very “interesting” times, and I have
                    a sort of standard question. Where were you debriefed? And the answer I get this
                    sort of incredulous, What, are you kidding? It's almost as though, okay, let's
                    move on. This is what I'm doing. This is what I've dedicated the rest of my life
                    for is essentially to debrief people and to find out what they did and to make a
                    record of it so it will be useful for historians and for interest - but also for
                    training and all that - because the State Department... I don't know what the
                    problem is. I know I was consul general in a place, and I met my successor, and
                    we talked for about five minutes, and it's almost, well, I don't want to know
                    too much about it because it might contaminate me when I go on to do something.
                    It's funny, so I wouldn't say this is atypical. I mean, I think this is very
                    typical.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I found it strange. The CIA asked me to come down to Washington. I was
                    back home. I was still on leave. I had been back for about two or three weeks,
                    and the CIA got in touch with me, and they asked me if I'd be willing to come
                    and talk to them, spend a day with them, and just to answer questions and to
                    talk about what happened - people, events, things that had happened in the
                    embassy. And I thought this was fine. And they paid my way to Washington. They
                    gave me per diem for a day, and I sat and they spent the whole day taping me. I
                    thought that was fine, but State never bothered.</p>
                <p>Now, the State Department did do one thing which, in a way, was... maybe it was
                    the State Department approach to a debriefing. They called several of us
                    together, the old Political Section - myself, John Limbert, Vic Tomseth - and
                    they had a couple of other people there from State. John Limbert is probably the
                    best of the Persian speakers in the State Department. In fact, his wife
                    [Parvaneh] is here at FSI, or she has been for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's he doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He has been named but not approved yet to go off as ambassador to
                    Sudan. I don't think he's gotten congressional approval. But anyway, they called
                    us in and sat us down in a nice room with a couple of people from the Middle
                    East bureau, NEA, and then the proceeded to try and explain how what had
                    happened had not been conscious government policy on the part of Iran, that this
                    had all been sort of a wildcat move by students who were not in any way
                    associated with the government. It's as though they wanted us to adopt that
                    line. I broke up the meeting, I'm afraid, by reminding them that we had been in
                    government prisons, in government facilities, surrounded by government guards,
                    etc. etc., etc., and I thought that they were just being stupid if they thought
                    that there was not government involvement. And the meeting just simply broke up.
                    They couldn't continue. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>That's understandable. Later it became understandable to me. At the beginning I
                    was a bit annoyed by it because I felt that my own life had been taken over by
                    other people, and I found that, in theory, I had a “spokesperson” waiting for me
                    in Pennsylvania. He lasted about one day, when I told him I could speak for
                    myself, thank you very much, and went on like that. There were several of us who
                    got to West Point and did not want to take part in the “Hollywood Squares”-type
                    interviews that were being given on TV. They had all sorts of people being
                    interviewed. When I say “Hollywood Squares,” they had some sort of deal with the
                    networks where -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what “Hollywood Squares” is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a quiz show with celebrities. It's more for
                        entertainment than for information.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And on the screen of the television - I'd forgotten how old that quiz
                    show was - you had a grid of people, usually three, three, and three, so that
                    they were like a tic-tac-toe grid. And they had hostages arranged like that,
                    too, with the cameras picking them up and transposing the figures so that there
                    were, I think, nine or 12 on the screen at the same time. I did not want to do
                    this because I had just no desire to be interviewed, especially with everyone
                    else, and I refused - a number of us refused - and on TV they said that “several
                    of the former hostages have refused to take part in any interviews. This appears
                    to be the same as the number of people who we believe have had serious
                    psychological problems.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was very nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, that was very nice. Reporters are bastards. They always have been.
                    Reporters and prostitutes vie for the oldest profession. But then I had to give
                    an interview, and I did. I gave an in-depth interview to a reporter who wrote a
                    note to me in Persian. I figured, if the reporter can write a note in Persian,
                    he was damn well worthy of getting an interview. He'd been a Peace Corps
                    volunteer in Iran and remembered enough Persian. He was also from my home town
                    newspaper, which made it perfect. So I gave him an exclusive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the official reception in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What about the official reception in Washington? I'm trying to remember
                    the official reception in Washington. The day that we arrived in Washington from
                    West Point, we were taken to the White House in Metro buses and paraded past the
                    State Department. We got to meet President Reagan, and we all had our handshake
                    and a photograph with him. It was a very nice ceremony at the White House. The
                    State Department was kind of excluded. It wasn't a State Department ceremony at
                    all; it was very much a “White House has brought you this victory” ceremony -
                    which is fine, it was politics. The State Department ceremony came much, much
                    later, and it was as tacky as you can possibly imagine the State Department can
                    be, which is pretty tacky. The State Department ceremony was about a month and a
                    half later, and it consisted of Alexander Haig... Well, I got a call from the
                    liaison officer who had been handling it, saying that the State Department was
                    going to hold a ceremony, and we were going to be presented with medals, the
                    medals were gold, and we would have to be there to receive the medal. Fine. I
                    agreed to come down to this ceremony with my parents, and the ceremony consisted
                    of a big presentation in one of those meeting rooms on the main floor of State.
                    Alexander Haig did not bother to read out our names or anything else, just gave
                    a small speech about service, God, honor - well, I guess not God, but honor,
                    country and the whole bit. And on our behalf, I think, Bruce Laingen accepted a
                    plaque or accepted a piece of paper from Alexander Haig, and then we were told
                    individually to proceed to a particular room of the State Department, where we
                    would be presented with the actual medal. I went to the room, and it turned out
                    to be a cubbyhole in Personnel, and when I walked in, there was a GS-8 or
                    someone sitting there, and I kind of looked around because I really had expected
                    maybe, you know, a cup of coffee or something like that. And I told her that I
                    had been told to come there to pick up a medal. And she said, what ceremony was
                    it? What's the award for? And I told her, and without batting an eye she went to
                    a stack of medals on a shelf, and there were lots of stacks of medals on the
                    shelf. She asked me my name, pulled out a box, had me sign a receipt, and that
                    was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing I just happened to remember. As I recall,
                        Jimmy Carter flew out to Wiesbaden. Was he there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did that work, because there would be... things
                        were sort of ambivalent, I would imagine?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Jimmy Carter came to Wiesbaden. I talked to my parents. I called my
                    parents as soon as I got there, of course. And my mother said, “President Carter
                    is going to come to see you all in Germany. Please be nice to him.” And I
                    couldn't imagine why she would even say that. I couldn't imagine not being
                    respectful to the President. It still hadn't sunk in that Reagan was President,
                    of course. But why wouldn't I be? And I had no idea why people would be angry.
                    None of this was Carter's fault. He was the President, but what happened was not
                    his fault. He did his best to get us out of there alive, and I think he did, all
                    in all, given the circumstances, a pretty good job of it. There were some people
                    there, I gather, who were angry or who walked out. They're just - what can I
                    say? - sort of idiots. There was no reason to do that. And one respects the
                    office of the President always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the way Carter probably lost the presidency because
                        of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, that's fine, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Presidency is as much luck as it is merit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how about whither Mike Metrinko? You had a job
                        to do and -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, what I did was do a little bit of traveling. I had been given an
                    assignment. They had sat us down and talked about assignments and basically
                    said, “What is your dream assignment? Where do you want to go? What do you want
                    to do?” What I had wanted to do for a long time, in fact I had put in for it
                    even when I was still in Teheran but, of course, had never gotten an answer,
                    thanks to events - I wanted to go and get a master's degree at Harvard. And I
                    told them that's what I want to do. I want to go off and get a master's degree.
                    And that was great, but what do you want to do after that? That's only a year.
                    And I said, “What about Poland? I'd like to get an assignment to Poland.” And
                    they arranged all that. It was all done, like, immediately.</p>
                <p>Okay, when I talked about the State Department reception - on ceremonies, the
                    State Department always sucks, but every once in a while it really pulls through
                    and rewards people. And I felt perfectly well compensated because I got to not
                    only go off and get a year of university training, but then I had a year of
                    Polish following that, and then I went off as principal officer in Krakow, which
                    was a great assignment, and it's had more effect on my life, probably, than any
                    of my other assignments.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, let's just touch on Harvard. You went to
                        Harvard, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking? What were you getting your master's
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I got a master's in public administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this going to the Kennedy School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Kennedy School, which has a very sort of free-wheeling curriculum.
                    You can take anything you want. I took some history course, Middle East history.
                    I took a fair number of administrative courses. I had excellent teachers. The
                    quality of the academic world of Harvard was superb. That's all I can say. It
                    was just absolutely great. One of my teachers for both semesters was Governor
                    Dukakis - a great teacher. I don't know what sort of President he would have
                    made. He was an excellent teacher, very personable, always questioning -
                    excellent. I had Richard Neustadt for two semesters, too - absolutely superb
                    professors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he hit you with that book, Thinking in Time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He was writing the book based on our class. We were partly guinea pigs
                    for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say I was profoundly impressed by it. This is a
                        book called Thinking in Time, by Neustadt and somebody else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, Ernie May.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ernie May.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He was actually my advisor there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In which they give a step-by-step way of, look, before you
                        make decisions, find out what happened before, which is certainly not the
                        State Department way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No. We react first and think about it later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, what we're doing here is somewhat of a positive
                        result of reading the book. Excellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ernie May was my student advisor. Neustadt and I became good friends. I
                    used to go to his house for dinner. He's wonderful, and just incredibly
                    intelligent. He knew everybody in American politics. A wonderful guy. It was a
                    good experience. The Harvard experience was -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Polish for a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I came back here to FSI, or to the old FSI building, took Polish for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any Ukrainian or Polish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No. My grandmother did not speak English, but I did not speak
                    Ukrainian. My parents spoke Ukrainian. I didn't speak it, though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know one of the things... I spent a year studying
                        Serbian, and I learned more about what's happening in present-day Serbia
                        from my teachers, and I understand Milosevic and all mainly because of my
                        teachers. So often when you take a language, you pick up quite a bit from
                        your teachers, and not necessarily in an official course, just by talking
                        with them. Were you picking up things about Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, absolutely. You know, in the strictest sense, you got to FSI not
                    only to learn the language but to learn to react to people, too. You can't study
                    a language in a vacuum. The teachers were all different. I learned a great deal
                    about Poland from watching them. Their Poland was a Poland that did not exist
                    any more. That was fine, too, in the sense that FSI seems all to often to hire
                    language teachers who represent long-disappeared regimes - instead of hiring
                    people -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's in the nature of -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - who's in America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But you were in Krakow from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I was in Krakow from July of 1983 until July of 1986. I got there at
                    the very tail-end of martial law. The Solidarity people were all in prison.
                    Jaruzelski was the head of Poland. There were student demonstrations off and on
                    the whole time I was there. It was a period when the United States had sanctions
                    against Poland. It was also a period in which the Pope was Polish, and it was a
                    rather strange time to be in Poland. A lot of what I heard about Poland from
                    here was simply not true. And at the same time... How do I explain this? Poland
                    is a strange country, very, very strange country. It's Europe, and yet somehow
                    it's not quite Europe, either. There's still a lot of the East there. And it's
                    certainly not Western Europe. It's Eastern Europe, which is different. That's
                    not very profound, is it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I mean, attitudes and all that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The people in Poland traveled. They came to the United States in large
                    numbers. The United States had a strong presence in Poland, not because of an
                    American military presence, which had been true in other countries I'd lived in
                    - Turkey and Iran, for example - but because we had so many American students
                    there and so many tourists visiting. It was not a political relationship, but it
                    was a people-to-people relationship. I had several hundred American students
                    studying at the University of Krakow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were studying medicine - medical studies, dentistry, things of
                    that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would sound like a fall-back position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes and no. At the time, American medical schools were very difficult
                    to get into and extraordinarily expensive. In Poland, the school was superb -
                    the University of Krakow, Jagiellonian University, is a fine old medieval
                    university where the medical studies are tops. They had an English program for
                    foreign students to study medicine in, and if you studied medicine for the whole
                    four or five years there, it would only cost you what it cost you to study one
                    year in the United States. And that meant living well, having a motorcycle,
                    having an apartment, and all your studies, all your books, plus your travel. So
                    this appeals to a lot of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you translate that medical degree into a job in the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Immediately, yes. On the trip that I was on two weeks ago in New
                    England, I spent some time visiting one of the former students, who is a doctor
                    up in New Hampshire. They got very, very decent jobs. They would come back here
                    and they would do internships in the summer often, or they would come back...
                    they did their residencies here, of course. And they got good residencies,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First let's talk about the consulate in Krakow. What was
                        it, and what was your main job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had in the consulate a large consular section. We had three American
                    officers in the Consular Section. We had an admin officer, an American; we had
                    one politico-economic officer; we had one USIA officer, and myself. Most of the
                    time, too, I had an American secretary. The main job was to keep the
                    representation going, the cultural representation and the consular
                    representation. We had a rather strange position in Krakow. In Warsaw, the
                    embassy had very cold contact with the government. The embassy was one of those
                    great Iron Curtain buildings set back behind high fences. Nobody could ever
                    quite get into it. It was always heavily watched, and the people in the embassy
                    had little or no contact with normal people outside the embassy. The Political
                    Section, the Economic Section were up on the third or fourth floor, surrounded
                    by the gates and the barriers and every thing else. Nobody went up there. They
                    did not leave very often, either.</p>
                <p>In Krakow, if we wanted to have lunch, we had to go outside. It was a great, old
                    renaissance building, with almost no security to speak of. USIA had a very
                    active program. People were always filling the library, which was right in the
                    lobby of the building. They would come to watch films. We had students coming
                    and going all the time. We would hire university students, local university
                    students, Poles, to do all the GSO-type work in the building, and it was always
                    filled with students from the universities. Several of us were taking Polish at
                    the university. I was one of them. So our lives there were far more tuned into
                    Polish society. We were received at very high levels, socially - in religious
                    terms, too. The local Cardinal was a good friend of mine. We would meet, dine,
                    etc., with all the local high-ranking clergy, the solidarity people, newspaper
                    editors. The only people who did not talk to us, officially, were the governors
                    of provinces and the heads of parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this deliberate? Who was calling the tune on this, our
                        government or their government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, everyone was supposed to try. However, we had sanctions in force
                    against Poland, and they would not receive us at that level. Now that was true,
                    and yet the Poles got around that, including the Polish officials. There was an
                    organization called Dom Polski, “the Polish House,” or “the House of Poland,”
                    which was a fine old commercial institution. It was sort of like a chamber of
                    commerce, if you will. The head of Dom Polski had absolutely excellent ties, of
                    course, with the Communist government. He had absolutely excellent ties with
                    foreign governments as well, and with Americans and with the consulate in
                    particular. And about once a month he would come over and invite me to a lunch
                    at the top of Dom Polski, which was in a lovely renaissance building on the
                    other side of the square, and I would go off to a private lunch, knowing it was
                    going to take the whole afternoon, and at the private lunch there would be three
                    or four of the top people in the province - never anyone who was purely
                    government, but they would be people who were the heads of major industries,
                    people who were the heads of major companies, some major cultural figures as
                    well. And we would have a nice, pleasant lunch, spend the afternoon together,
                    and then go back to kind of not talking to each other for the next month.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the boundary of Krakow, and what were the major
                        activities of that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Krakow is the former capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of
                    Galicia. Southern Poland was the area from which most of the immigrants to the
                    United States actually went. It had been the poorest of the Austro-Hungarian
                    provinces, but because so many people had left from there to get to America,
                    including three of my grandparents, it meant that as time passed it became the
                    richest of the provinces -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the money coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - with the money coming back, and because of the ties people had with
                    the United States and with the West in general. We had all over southern Poland
                    houses called “dollar houses,” which were being built by people who had gone to
                    America as tourists and had worked for a year or two. Everyone there had ties in
                    one way or another with the United States - not everyone, I'm exaggerating
                    slightly, but a large number of people including officials had ties with the
                    United States. It was always rather funny, when some high official who was not
                    supposed to talk to us would have to get a visa for a son or daughter. But we
                    accommodated that, and it was to Krakow, to the consulate, in fact, to me, that
                    when one of the five members of the Polish Politburo, the head of the Polish
                    Government, one of the five top people, wanted to go to the United States, he
                    came and saw me in Krakow instead of going to the embassy, because he could
                    approach me in Krakow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard that somebody, I'm not sure where he was or
                        exactly what time, but somewhat in this period, who said he was convinced
                        that there were at least three dedicated Communists in Poland at the time he
                        was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was hard to know which three he would have meant. Poland was
                    wonderful. Let me give you an example of the lengths that they would go to
                    prove, I guess to the Soviets and themselves, that they were anti-capitalist and
                    how they would get around things. There was an old guild - I mean a real bona
                    fide medieval guild - in Krakow called the Chicken Sharpshooters, and it was a
                    guild of restaurant owners, tavern owners, barkeepers, and a variety of other
                    people who had over time joined this guild. They would parade around in great
                    costumes with silver gilt chickens around their necks and wear their medieval
                    clothes in all parades, and they were always, because it was the oldest of
                    guilds and represented all the others, they were the ones who would always lay
                    wreaths on official holidays. I got to know the guild heads because they were
                    right behind me in laying wreaths. I used to lay wreaths all the time. I became
                    the master of wreath ceremonies. People would come down from the embassy just to
                    be included in laying the wreath at this ceremony or that ceremony. It was
                    great. The guild invited me to dinner at their guild headquarters. This was
                    great. And the head of the guild said, “But please, Mr. Consul, don't bring your
                    own car. You understand, we don't want people to see your car in front of our
                    building.” Fine, I said. He said, “I'll send a car for you.” Well, the time
                    came, somebody came upstairs to my office and said the car is here from the
                    guild. I went down and got into a car with a driver, and off we went to the
                    guild headquarters. A late lunch, as they always did in Poland, became more and
                    more a dinner. At around six or so, the driver knocked on the door and came in
                    and said, “Excuse me, Mr. Consul, but I just wanted to know if you know how long
                    you're going to be here because I have to go and pick up my boss. I could drive
                    you home first and then go get him, or I could go and take him home and then
                    come back for you later.” The guild head said, “Oh, don't go yet. We're having
                    fun. There's still plenty of time.” So he told the driver, go back, take your
                    boss home, and come back in about two hours. I had assumed he was the guild
                    director's driver, and after he left I turned to the guild director and said,
                    “Who does he work for?” And he said, “Oh, he's the Party First Secretary's
                    driver.” And I said, “That was the First Secretary's car, of Krakow Province?”
                    He said, “Well, yes.” And he didn't want me to drive my car!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting of reflections of Jaruzelski?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Polish view of the government was a bit strange. Not strange -
                    there were several components, some of which were mutually exclusive, but all of
                    which somehow meshed together to let the Poles ride out that whole period. One
                    is this. The Poles were desperately attached to law and order. They had been
                    smashed in World War II. They had lost whole cities, towns, villages. They had
                    lost 20 per cent of their population. They did not want any more broken windows,
                    any more shattered buildings, any more bombings, any arson or anything else.
                    They wanted everything to be peaceful. This was all across the country. One
                    reason being that if your window got broken, it was awfully hard to get glass to
                    replace it, but still, nobody wanted disorder.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the Poles were incredibly nationalist and did not want any
                    hint... or they were simply tired of having the relationship with the Soviet
                    Union. It was a boot on Poland, and they knew it and they wanted out of it. It
                    offended their sense of Polishness. Fine. Solidarity was appealing to Poles, but
                    at the same time not appealing to the upper class of Poles - and yes, there was
                    an upper class of Poles. Call them the Schlachta, if you will, the old sort of
                    landed class. They had lost most of their land, but many of them still had their
                    big houses and apartments. They still had their names, which were famous in
                    Polish history. They still had their ties to being this or that - Daddy was a
                    professor and mommy was this - and while on the one hand they supported
                    Solidarity because it was a finger in the face of the Soviets, on the other
                    hand, they considered the Solidarity people sort of “worker trash.” You had all
                    that happening. Also, in the villages, they really did not care very much for
                    Solidarity. The role of Solidarity never caught on. It was a worker thing from
                    the big cities, but out in the villages and the farms, they didn't care much
                    about this at all. They just wanted to go to church on Sunday, get drunk on
                    Saturday, and do the field work and get a job in the United States or Germany or
                    Austria once in a while to get some hard cash - and nothing else, thank you.</p>
                <p>Now when I arrived there, all the Solidarity leaders were in prison. They were
                    being allowed out of prison whenever they had an appointment at the American
                    consulate or another western consulate to process their asylum cases, so we had
                    a list of people coming in every week, straight from prison for the day, to
                    process requests for asylum in the United States. This was a Polish official way
                    of dealing with Solidarity. I might add that no one, as far as I know, died in
                    prison. The Poles who were in Solidarity and were taken to prison came out
                    looking fat. They did not come out looking beaten, emaciated, or anything else.
                    They came out looking pudgy and soft and fat, and most of them - not the top top
                    leaders, not Lech Walesa and a couple of the others, but many of the sort of
                    mid-level ones simply went off to the United States or to other Western
                    countries with asylum status.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was during my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A Polish priest who was giving anti-regime sermons in church,
                    attracting a lot of attention. He was warned a couple of times to stop, did not.
                    He was picked by a couple of Ministry of the Interior people and ended up dead.
                    I think it was the only case in the three years I was there, and his church
                    became a shrine then to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, that this was not a crime but a
                        mistake?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, very great, a mistake. You know what's strange about all this was
                    the position of the Church itself. The Church had a stake in security and
                    stability. The Church was very Polish, very Polish, very nationalist. It had a
                    lot of Church property. It had lost a great deal, but it still had a great deal.
                    It had worked out a sort of life with the government. It worked together. You
                    could get things done. Government officials would use the church for ceremonies.
                    Government officials would attend ceremonies in the church. Party members
                    attended mass. It was never like the Soviet Union. And churchmen traveled. They
                    did not preach a lot of rebellion. And yet at the same time they were supportive
                    of Solidarity. But the whole thing managed to work. When you look at what
                    happened in Poland during that period - say, 1980 to the breakup of the Soviet
                    Union -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1992.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, which was not a short time - almost no one died. Very few people,
                    for political reasons. There were never many real accusations of nasty crimes by
                    the government. They would hose people down. If there was a strike or if there
                    was a big demonstration, the police would come out with their hoses, and they
                    would use colored water so that it would stain the clothes of the people who
                    were taking part in the demonstration, so they couldn't use those clothes again.
                    But that was it. They'd pick people up and then release them that day, and yes,
                    they were rather unpleasant around the consulate - they did quite a bit of
                    harassment of consulate people, and they also harassed people coming and going.
                    They would follow my car, for example, and stay a few inches away from the car
                    the whole way - literally, almost touching the car - things like that. But they
                    didn't kill, they didn't hit - not really - at least not that we knew of.</p>

                        This was a rightful rebellion that could go on for a long time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, it wasn't rightful rebellion. Poles aren't rebels. It wasn't going
                    to happen there. There were too many strong forces that wanted things to go
                    slowly. That included the education system; that included the Church (which was
                    very strong); that included the business interests there; and that included the
                    government. The whole way that Solidarity was treated by the government, I
                    think, was indicative of this - that they weren't smashed. They were broken up,
                    but not smashed. And I think you could see the results when Solidarity took
                    over, when there was this, you know... the Communist Party one morning
                    disappeared. Nothing really happened to the old high-ranking Communist
                    officials. They all became part of the new government or simply took jobs in
                    private industry. They didn't go to prison. Contrast that with, say, Romania or
                    a couple of other places.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: I think most people considered that a joke. It was a joke. If you were
                    a party member and you worked in a factory, you would get vacations in the
                    Soviet Union, which you would go to, but you'd far prefer going to Paris or
                    London or the United States to visit your aunt in Chicago. The friendship just
                    wasn't there.</p>

                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>METRINKO. The Soviet Army was there. I almost never saw it because it was not
                    readily visible anywhere around Krakow. I'd had a lot of family in Poland, and
                    when I discussed family visits with other people, I was told everywhere was fine
                    except, “don't go to western Poland,” to a couple of towns where I had family,
                    because that's where the Soviet army is based. “It's just better for them and
                    for you, for the family and for you, if you don't go there.” But that was it. I
                    remember once - this was one comment, driving on the road. You could go anywhere
                    in Poland, or almost anywhere. Ninety-nine per cent of the country was open to
                    you. I was driving to Germany once, and was going through that part of Poland,
                    and I stopped to get gas, and the gas station attendant looked at the car, and
                    he said, “You're a diplomat?” And I said, “Yes.” And he said, “Where are you
                    from?” And I said, “From America.” And he asked a couple of questions about
                    Poland, and that was fine, and then he looked at me, he said, “You know, when
                    you go back to America, why don't you take all these Soviet soldiers with you.
                    We're tired of them. Take them with you.” That was the attitude.</p>

                    It was not Romania. Poles traveled and could travel quite freely. University
                    students always took off, disappeared, went all around Europe. Good gosh, people
                    came to the United States easily. At the time, I think we were doing more than
                    50 visas a day in Krakow - something like that.</p>

                    It's not that Poles don't go back; they simply come here, or used to come here,
                    and work and then go back after six months or a year. If you think about it,
                    very, very few people in the world can afford an American vacation. If you are
                    really coming to the United States and are going to spend time in a hotel
                    touring, you had better be a Japanese millionaire. You can't afford it. Most
                    consular officers know this. Your average tourist, the one who applies for a
                    tourist visa, isn't really intending to spend $10,000 to go to Disneyland.
                    They're going to either visit relatives they're not telling you about, or
                    they're going to do some work when they get here. Students always work. American
                    students work overseas; foreign students work here. They come here and work
                    their way across the country for the summer, or go to somewhere for the summer,
                    and work and then go back to their schools.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We kept doing studies on that, anecdotal, granted. We would also check
                    with local tourism bureaus, people like that, people who sort of watched this;
                    and the feeling was that most Poles came back. The ones who did not stayed for
                    legitimate reasons. They would get married when they got here. No problem.
                    Doesn't bother me. In general, they did come back. They would come back to build
                    their houses and settle down in them.</p>
                <p>Q: What about - let's put it - Chicago? I mean, did Chicago weigh heavily as a

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had almost no American official visitors. In the entire time I was
                    in Krakow we had exactly one CODEL. That was Senator Duremberger, and the main
                    reason he came, he was then the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee - he
                    came because his mother had been an immigrant from Poland, and she wanted to see
                    the place where she had been born. She had immigrated when she was a young
                    child. And he came with a couple of members of his staff and his mother. And it
                    was one of the funniest trips I ever saw, but other than that-</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>He came at a time when we had not had an official American visitor in a couple of
                    years. Nobody knew how to handle these any more. He arrived at the embassy, and
                    the embassy quite properly assigned him a control officer from the Political
                    Section - always a mistake (they never seem to know what they're doing) - and
                    gave him a van from the embassy to use, and a driver of course, to take him from
                    Warsaw to Czestochowa to Krakow. Well, after all the receptions in Warsaw were
                    over, they took off and were heading down towards Krakow, and they simply did
                    not arrive. And we waited and waited and waited, and things were getting later
                    and later. Luckily the reception was going to be for the next day, but still,
                    they hadn't arrived yet. And we got a call from the embassy explaining that the
                    van had gotten about two hours outside the city of Warsaw, right in the middle
                    of all the empty fields, and had run out of gas. They had forgotten to put gas
                    in the van. Well, this was at a time when gas was rationed. It wasn't a matter
                    of using dollars. You could not get it unless you had ration coupons. Neither
                    the driver nor the political officer had thought to bring ration coupons for the
                    gasoline. So the driver had to hitchhike back to the embassy. It didn't occur to
                    either the officer or the driver to simply go and make a phone call. He
                    hitchhiked back. So they had Duremberger, his mother, the staffers from the
                    committee, and everyone else sitting in the middle of a field for about three or
                    four hours waiting for the driver to come back with another embassy car, jerry
                    cans of gasoline, and ration tickets. And the comment that I had from charg�
                    was, “Michael, when they get there, tell the driver and tell [so-and-so, the
                    political officer] to stay in the van and to keep driving south until they fall
                    off the edge of the Carpathian Mountains.” That was a good visit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems with American citizens coming back
                        and getting in trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Not really. We would have American citizens coming back and being so
                    overwhelmed by hospitality, by vodka and kielbasi and ham and pastry, that they
                    would have heart attacks. That happened a couple of times, and we had a couple
                    of deaths there. It think it was that. They were just overwhelmed by all the
                    things they weren't supposed to be doing for their health - one American who
                    came back and died in his girlfriend's arms, and we never quite told the wife or
                    children back home how exactly he'd died. Things like that. But coming back and
                    getting in trouble, no. We had a couple of Americans who got arrested once. We
                    had a bad spate of relations following a Mayday demonstration when I had gone
                    off to the central square of the city to take part in the official government
                    Mayday celebrations, you know, to stand on the platform with all the generals
                    and the other officials and the diplomatic community, such as it was, in the
                    pouring rain to commemorate Mayday, while the head of the Consular Section and
                    my USIA officer had gone off to the Solidarity demonstration in their old
                    clothes, to report on what was happening. They got picked up by the police, and
                    they were PNGed from Poland. They were given 48 hours to leave. Unfortunately, I
                    also lost my secretary, who was married to the consular officer. And three or
                    four American tourists were arrested that same day. They were taking pictures in
                    the central square of Krakow. They were basically people on vacation, and they
                    were young, but good cameras, taking pictures of all the decorations and
                    everything else for Mayday, and the parade, and they got arrested and thrown in
                    prison, and I had to go in and get them out because my consular officer was no
                    longer able to function as a consular officer. After that, things slowly
                    improved.</p>
                <p>Now this also never meant that the people of the city were anti-American, because
                    immediately after that when I thought the world had ended - you know, I've just
                    lost half my American staff, things are awful, the government hates us, we have
                    no idea where we're going to get other people in to fill their places - about
                    three or four days after that, I had to go to attend a ceremony that was
                    non-official. There was a ceremony where a wreath was laid at the Pilsudski
                    Mound, which was just outside the city of Krakow. It was a huge commemorative
                    mound that had been put up in 1900 or so in honor of Pilsudski. It looked like a
                    pyramid, but it was all dirt. And people would go up there to put flowers on it,
                    I think on his birthday, if I'm not mistaken. And there was a drive up there. It
                    was on the other side of the city park. As my car approached, and there were
                    thousands of people lining this thing... The people of Krakow would all walk up,
                    and it was always a nice picnic day. As my car approached, the crowd just burst
                    into applause, and we got applauded for the next 15 minutes, all the way up. The
                    whole hill just was applauding us. They knew what was going on. It was
                    great.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just administratively, how did you get replacements? I
                        mean, were you tempted to cut off visas for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, no, no. I used to go out and sit in the Visa Section myself and
                    make sure that we could get rid of the lines. No, never that, because cutting
                    off the visas would have been great as far as the local government was
                    concerned, and they could have said that we were stopping people from traveling.
                    How did we do it? We just did it. We all worked longer. The political officer
                    and the USIA officer would double on the visa line whenever they had to. We just
                    did it. I got a replacement in fairly quickly. Oh, one of the wives was hired as
                    an admin officer. Eventually she joined the Foreign Service. It was her first
                    job like that, and she took over the admin function. Others of us helped in the
                    Consular Section. It think the embassy sent us down people temporarily.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find visiting the cardinal, other members of the
                        Church, a good source of information of what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Very good. Number one, to coin a pun, they put an imprimatur on our
                    behavior. The cardinal in Krakow had been personally selected by the Pope. He
                    had been the Pope's confessor and philosophy teacher when the Pope was in the
                    seminary. He was chosen personally by the Pope. If I walked into a reception and
                    he was there, he would walk over, pick up a glass of wine, and bring it over to
                    me. He was a great guy. He made sure that I met all the leading clergy in the
                    area. Now, did he sit there and give me reports? No, he was a renaissance
                    cardinal. This was part of his function, to deal with the foreign diplomats, but
                    he was also a great guy and made life a lot easier for me there because he
                    approved of things, the work that I was doing. He also, by the way, arranged a
                    private audience with the Pope, which I thought was quite nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Pope being Polish, did he visit Krakow when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, when I was there, no. He had visited just a few weeks before.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There weren't any pictures of Lenin or Stalin. There were statutes
                    around, official statues, but people... there was no cult the way you'd have in
                    other countries. If there was a cult, it was a cult of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
                    There wasn't this attachment to Communism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It wasn't, but they preferred coming to me rather than going to Warsaw,
                    and so I handled all their visas, and I made a little bit of deal... I mean, not
                    a deal, but when they came down, a representative of the monastery, I made a
                    little ceremony out of it always because it was, indeed, a center of Polish
                    life, and I was a friend of the bishop of Czestochowa. So I would go up there to
                    visit him. I also had cousins in Czestochowa, so I would go up there to visit
                    them. But we had a very good relationship with the monastery and with the
                    bishop's office, too, up there. In fact, I was introduced to the bishop of
                    Czestochowa by the Cardinal over breakfast. That's how I met the bishop of
                    Czestochowa. So this played out. I don't think the embassy ever visited Cardinal
                    Glemp. Maybe there were, I don't remember seeing any sort of messages or
                    reporting about dealing with the clergy in that part of -</p>

                    think it was after I left, actually. But he was there the whole time I was. He
                    had a predecessor whose name I don't remember, who was only there for a month or
                    so when I got there. John Davis was excellent, certainly let me have a rather

                    talked about him, and strangely enough, I think certainly the Polish Church and
                    the Solidarity people and a lot of other people in Poland supported the embargo
                    and the sanctions that we had against Poland, which was always a bit strange to

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm trying to think. Most of the Poles in the top levels of academia
                    there weren't American-educated. And American education would simply have been
                    too expensive of them at the time. When you think about salaries there, the
                    rector of a university, his salary on the black market came up to about $25 a
                    month. My maid got more than that from me. But teachers, professors, people like
                    that, were getting large salaries by Polish standards, but out in the real
                    world, the salaries were worthless.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: One of the richest cultures I've ever been exposed to, an extremely
                    extensive and intensive cultural life, and we were always included. In Krakow,
                    there was a world-class composer, Penderecki. Penderecki is a very fine sort of
                    modern composer. While I was in Poland, I think it was his 50th birthday, the
                    commemoration was held at the Kennedy Center, and it was attended by Ronald
                    Reagan. So if you could imagine, it was this local guy from Krakow, but
                    Penderecki was also a good friend of the consulate. He invited us over all the
                    time. He would have the whole staff to his home for dinner. When he had a major
                    cultural even going on, and he hosted a lot of them, he would have us all
                    attending. He was an absolutely pleasant person, as was his wife.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, there was the underground, kind of underground, theater. We
                    always all received free tickets to everything - for the concerts, for the
                    plays, for the ballet, for this, for that. We would just get calls right from
                    the theaters, right from wherever, the ballet, or from the conservatory, saying
                    we're having an opening, an art gallery opening, this opening, that opening,
                    first day of the play, first day of the ballet - you know, how many tickets does
                    the consulate want? And we went all the time. Of course, you could walk to this.
                    It was also cheap enough to buy. I mean, tickets were all heavily subsidized,
                    and at the time... not like here. I never go to cultural events here because I'm
                    not going to spend $100 or $200 to attend something. I can't afford to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Yugoslavia I went to everything. Here, I'm wiped
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Also here, it's too far to get to. There I could walk, and I did walk,
                    to concerts, the ballet, to this or that. It was simply easy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were American films playing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: American films played there. In fact, I have a huge collection of
                    Polish movie posters advertising American films. I made the mistake once of
                    having a USIA film in my house, an American film, and I learned never to do that
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: USIA called me and said, “We have Sophie's Choice, which has just
                    arrived. Would you like to have an opening, a showing, in Krakow?” And, “What's
                    it about?” Oh, it's about, you know, Meryl Streep is in it, this and that, etc.,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's about a concentration camp.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's about a concentration camp, and that was fine, but because of who
                    was in the film... and it was based upon a Styron book, and Styron was well
                    known in Poland, too. In fact, he was a house guest of mine there at one point.
                    And Kurt Vonnegut came and spent a couple of days. But I thought it was a great
                    idea to have a film. The mistake I made was not looking at the film first, and
                    no one in Warsaw had looked at the film, either. We just got this in canisters,
                    set up the projector... I had about 25 of the top level of Polish society, or
                    whatever you want to call it, sitting in my living room after a very nice
                    dinner, and the movie started rolling. And the first scene is Meryl Streep
                    getting thrown down the steps by her boyfriend, who screams at her, “Go back to
                    Krakow, you Polish whore!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And it went on from there. And of course, Sophie's father had been a
                    collaborator with the Germans, who was also a professor at the University of
                    Krakow. This was most unpleasant. My cook walked out because she couldn't take
                    the... She had been in a concentration camp and just could not watch this. It
                    was a total disaster. Never show films unless you see them first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about getting around? You mentioned being sort of
                        harassed by the police. Were there concerns about setting you up, you know
                        the usual things that were going on, drugs, sex, a guy who says, “Please
                        take this package” (with microfilms) - back - something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Actually, the only time that ever came up with me was during the
                    security briefing, when, I guess, DS just discovered that I was a bachelor going
                    off to Poland and, worse than that, that I might have family there. And I didn't
                    know any of my family there. I knew vaguely that I had some family there. They
                    were distant cousins. I got to meet them later. But somebody from DS sat me down
                    and started going over this, you know, about how DS doesn't want me to go there
                    for the following reasons. And I just looked at him and said, “Look, if I should
                    get trapped in bed with somebody and photographs taken, I would just ask for
                    extra copies. Things have changed. Who's going to care? I don't have a wife to
                    care. My parents would think it was normal. My brothers and my friends would
                    think it was natural. Who cares about this?” I said, “Talk to the married guys,
                    whose wives would care.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems of the security organization trying to
                        set you up, you or your people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, we had harassment, but no setup attempts. The French consul general
                    had an incident happen to him, and it was sort of a classic 1950s
                    black-and-white bad movie incident. The French consul general was a great guy,
                    but an elderly man with an elderly wife, and they were as French bourgeois as
                    you could possibly get. They went to daily mass. And elderly. He was coming back
                    into his apartment building one day, and he turned the light on in the lobby, a
                    blond girl jumped out, leaped at him, and the flashbulbs went off. The French
                    lodged a protest about 20 minutes later in Warsaw, and that's where it stopped.
                    They just never bothered trying that with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as you said, times have changed. These things may
                        have worked at one point. One always thinks of the famous case of Scarbeck,
                        I guess it was, who was GSO, general services officer, in the early '60s in
                        Warsaw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I didn't know about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was caught. He gave out some third-rate secrets, I
                        think, because he had a girlfriend who needed an operation, you know. But
                        how about other countries? Was Poland playing any role in getting people
                        from other parts of the world and sending them to university there or trying
                        to do anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There were a fair number of Arab students in Poland. I had no contact
                    with them. Basically, no. It had played a role back after the Greek Civil War,
                    for example. A lot of the Greek Communists came to Poland. That was no longer
                    true. I'm trying to think of... No, the students that Poland had were basically
                    the American students who wanted to get a cheap, good medical education.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Iranian experience come up at all while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, in fact I lectured on the subject for the Dominican monastery.
                    They had me in to talk to their novices about it, and they were all very
                    interested in the role of the clergy in politics, I might say - very interested.
                    I had Iranian house guests come quite often, from Iran. They could visit Europe,
                    so they would come and see me, spend a week and go back to Teheran or go on to
                    other parts of Europe. Other than that, not really. Poland and Iran never had
                    any sort of connection. There was and Iranian embassy in Warsaw. Other than
                    that, no real connection. I think Poland was a bit too Catholic to like what had
                    happened in Iran. And also, the Polish people simply seemed to abhor violence.
                    It's strange, but when you think about violence and countries that do it, the
                    whole time that I was in Poland I think I saw one street fight in three years,
                    and it was between a couple of drunks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Serious problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Very serious at the time. I understand that it no longer is, according
                    to all my cousins, anyway. Their generation simply does not drink very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think with jobs and the future, it's no
                        longer...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: At the time it was a serious problem. If you were driving a car out in
                    the countryside on a Sunday morning, for example, you would see people
                    staggering up and down streets, falling in the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Soviet consul there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There was a Soviet consul general there. They had consul general
                    status, which means they always took diplomatic precedence, protocol precedence,
                    over the French and the Americans. They were - I don't want to say this: we had
                    a “correct” relationship with them. I would go there for their national day, and
                    I would go there to sign their books of mourning or the condolence books,
                    because -</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, and I went and signed all the books, properly dressed in a dark
                    suit, and they would come to the Fourth of July celebrations - not at the top
                    level - they would send their number two, just as... I went to their national
                    day celebrations and did not drink. Of course, they didn't drink by the second
                    one, either. They were no longer supposed to serve alcohol, and a Soviet
                    reception without alcohol is deadly, because nobody would be talking to anybody
                    else, just a couple of hundred people standing there. It was just awful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I almost never saw it. I mean, I would only see army people on the
                    important celebrations. Oh, I take that back. They'd be there doing a sort of
                    goose-step up and down in front of the monuments, and also late at night,
                    because it was still a Communist state at the time, security at night in the
                    city was superb.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds pleasant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was pleasant. I had no problems with this. You could walk anywhere
                    in the city at one or two or three in the morning to anywhere else, and you
                    would see soldiers, and they would even say “Good evening.” If you said “Good
                    evening,” they would say “Good evening” back. And they would be walking in
                    pairs, and that would be it. Everything was absolutely fine.</p>

                        to worship Lenin and so forth, that sort of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Not at all. Because they had Polish teachers. You know, people would
                    pay lip-service to things. They all studied Russian. Very few of them learned
                    it. Just like we don't learn Latin or Spanish or whatever in high school. But
                    there was not even a pretense of affection by the people or even interest in the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there interest in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Tremendous. Very strong interests. I'll give you an example - US
                    relations with the Soviet consulate. It wasn't the last - I think it was the
                    second - I've forgotten which of them - the second, probably - of the July 4th
                    celebrations that we gave. They were always hugely attended. I mean each time
                    that we had one we had 400, 500 people come, and they had huge amounts of
                    alcohol and huge amounts of food. At the last one, I had three different bands
                    playing, a country-western band, a mountain band, and a jazz band, in different
                    parts of the consulate, so people could dance or listen, depending on how they
                    wanted to do it. And all the bands volunteered, by the way. They wanted to get
                    the exposure. But the Soviet number-two guy had come to one of these July 4
                    receptions, and he showed up and parked his car, of course, the driver parked
                    right in front of the door, because he was only going to spend 10 minutes there.
                    He came in, and I greeted him in line. It was very pleasant and cool, and he
                    disappeared into the maelstrom of people who were swirling around, the hundreds
                    of people in there, and I promptly forgot about him. Well, about an hour later,
                    when the receiving line finally ended, I went into the crowd myself, and I saw
                    the consul standing there, and he saw me. He came over, and he said, “Oh, Mr.
                    Consul, I'm embarrassed. I really only intended to spend a few minutes here, but
                    it's very interesting. We can't get people to come to our receptions, and I'm
                    meeting people here for the first time.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's embarrassing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>METRINKO: He said it quite frankly. “They won't come to our receptions.” And he
                    said, “You don't mind if I stay a little longer, do you?” And I said, “No, stay
                    as long as you want. It's going to go on till one or two in the morning.” And he
                    disappeared again. What I did not know - we always hired Polish university
                    students to staff these things. They would serve as the waiters, the bartenders,
                    the this, the that. My maid and my cook would do the food preparation. It was
                    just a huge effort. And these were the same students who'd been helping us out
                    over a period of a couple of years. They had seen the Soviet car pull up in
                    front, and one of them had gone out and asked the driver what he could bring him
                    to drink, and the driver, of course, properly said, “Nothing.” So the student
                    had come back in and gotten a small plate of food and he had gotten a big
                    Coca-Cola, which he had laced with Vodka, and he took it out to the driver. And
                    the driver drank it and asked for another Coca-Cola. Well, by the time the
                    Soviet consul got outside, his driver was unconscious behind the wheel of the
                    car. I had no idea any of this was happening. All the Poles knew. The consul was
                    also drunk by the time he left. He got out, he was drunk, he sat in the car. The
                    driver was unconscious. Eventually somebody got the car out of there and back to
                    the Soviet Consulate. The consul was not allowed to go out by himself from then
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about USIA? What was it doing and how effective was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: USIA, quite effective. Unfortunately, USIA had a problem in that the
                    USIA officer... We had three very good officers there at one time. The first one
                    was there for almost a year. He's still one of their top officers. He's a great
                    guy. He spoke fluent Russian, Polish, English, Japanese, etc. - very, very fine.
                    You know, sort of the quintessential USIA officer. He, by the way, had an
                    interesting experience, which happened just before I got there. You asked about
                    the Pope's visit and the feelings of the Poles toward Russians. This guy's name
                    was Alexander Olmasov. He had immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child. I
                    think he'd been born in a refugee camp. His father had been a Soviet citizen. He
                    came to the United States, eventually joined the American Foreign Service. They
                    sent him to Poland eventually. He spoke fluent Russian. His name was a Russian
                    name. He looked Russian. He was the USIA officer who was in charge of USIA
                    coverage of the Pope's visit a month or two before I got there. In the car that
                    he was being driven in, the car had an accident. The driver was speeding and ran
                    into a tree or something like that. He was badly hurt. His face was all bloodied
                    up and he had broken teeth. They rushed him to a local clinic out there where
                    the Pope was visiting. The police told the clinic people, “This is a foreign
                    consul. Take care of him immediately. It's very important.” They asked his name,
                    and he said, “Aleksandr Olmasov.” He lay there and lay there and lay there, and
                    nurses and doctors kept passing him by, not coming over. Finally, he asked for
                    help, and they said, “Yes, we'll get to you, we'll get to you. There are more
                    important things happening.” And finally someone said something about the
                    American consul. The doctor said, “What do you mean, 'the American consul'?
                    That's the Russian consul.” “No, it's the American consul.” They thought he was
                    the Russian, and they were going to ignore him!</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>But anyway, he left and was replaced by Bill Harwood - excellent also. Bill
                    lasted a very short time because he was PNGed. He was one of the two officers
                    who had gone off on May 1 to the Solidarity demonstration. And then we had a
                    long hiatus - months, about half a year or so - when I filled in. And
                    eventually, John Brown came, who got there just a few months before I left. He
                    also seemed to be doing quite fine. They were good officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the reading room played a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: An important role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - the university and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, the library was always filled. There were always large groups of
                    students there. The USIA ran films. They would show American films in the
                    evenings, and it was always fully attended. We had a small theater. That was
                    going on. They had a very active student counseling service. There was a
                    Fulbright Program that worked in both directions, of course. Americans came to
                    Krakow, came to Poland. A number of them came to Krakow. And Poles went to the
                    United States from Krakow. That was quite active as well. There was a very busy,
                    I'd say, cultural life. American artists, American musicians, other Americans
                    came all the time or went to the United States all the time. I would say that
                    the USIA office there was extremely active, extremely well qualified. They also
                    knew every body in the city and the province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They often have the best connections, the cultural and the
                        press side, that really lets you into a much wider world than the normal

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That's absolutely true, and I benefitted from it certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1986, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In 1986, I was told by my career counselor that I had to come back to
                    the United States because, much as I disliked the idea of returning to the State
                    Department, I had to come back because it was important for my career. So having
                    the choice of a couple of jobs, I took one as deputy director of Northern Gulf
                    Affairs - Iran and Iraq. We had a war going on between the two countries, and it
                    was an interesting two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did this from '86 to 88.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The war ended just as I left. I cannot take credit for ending the war.
                    '86 to '88 was marked by Ollie North and Irangate and all of the accusations
                    that the United States was supporting Iraq. It was marked by our attempts,
                    through “Operation Stanch,” to stop people from supplying weapons to either
                    side, which was absolutely great until the world discovered we had been
                    supplying weapons to the Iranians, courtesy of Ollie North and the NSA.</p>
                <p>Let's see, what else was going on? We were starting to get accusations of October
                    surprise. We, of course, had off-again-on-again-will-we-ever-get-back-with-Iran?
                    Everybody and his brother from Iran would claim to be representing everybody
                    else and his brother from Iran trying to reestablish relations. Nothing has
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing the Iran-Iraq Desk '86 to '88. Could you
                        describe what the situation was between Iran and Iraq at the beginning? You
                        took it over, and what was our posture towards this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The situation was that Iran and Iraq were in the middle of a bloody
                    war. The war had started in the year 1980. It was already 1986 when I got there.
                    It had been going on for six years, and both sides had lost hundreds of
                    thousands of people to death and injury. They had both lost huge numbers of
                    buildings, materiel, etc. to each other's bombs. Both countries were suffering
                    greatly because of the war. Both countries, being equally stupid, were
                    continuing the war. Iraq was having a problem with its Kurds in the north, who
                    were opposed to the regime of Baghdad. Iran, of course, were having huge
                    problems with people opposed to the regime of Khomeini. There were mass
                    desertions, people running away from military service. Both sides were
                    continuing the war. The United States, as it turned out later, had been
                    supplying some sort of intelligence to the Iraqis. At the same time, it was
                    supplying limited amounts of weapons to Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this going on when you took over the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was. We did not find out about it for a few months. I think a few
                    people in the State Department knew about it. I believe that a few people at
                    State knew about it, but they weren't talking. Instead, the public policy was
                    Operation Stanch, where we give neither weapons nor assistance to either side,
                    and we asked all other countries to join this so that they would stop fighting.
                    And we, of course, were doing double deals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the wiring diagram of your job? In other
                        words, to whom did you report where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I was deputy director for Iran and Iraq, Northern Gulf Affairs. The
                    director for most of the time I was there was Peter Burleigh, who went on to
                    become ambassador, I think, in Sri Lanka eventually and later on, for a long
                    time, our ambassador to the United Nations until Holbrooke came in, and he's now
                    retired. I was his deputy, and there were a Desk officer for Iran and a Desk
                    officer for Iraq and two secretaries. It was a small office, but a very active
                    office. We worked long hours. There was always something happening. I think I
                    was probably the first person there in many, many years who spoke Persian, and I
                    was certainly the only one in the office who had ever served in Iran. In fact, I
                    was the only person, I think, in NEA in the Department who spoke Farsi.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, when you got there, what was the attitude towards Iran and towards Iraq,
                    would you say, that you were picking up?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had relations with Iraq. We had a charg� in Iraq and an embassy, but
                    the relationship was never a warm, bubbly one. It was sort of stiff and formal.
                    But the embassy was trying. That's probably because of the nature of the Iraqis
                    themselves. They're not warm, bubbly people. And Iraq had never generated much
                    interest in the United States. There were no Iraqi experts out there in
                    academia. The Iraqi opposition didn't live here; it was dead. If you wanted to
                    get a conference about Iraq, I don't think you could have put together a
                    full-fledged conference in America with anyone approaching any degree of
                    expertise. It was sort of an unknown country. It should not have been, but the
                    relationships had been rocking back and forth, up and down, for so long that it
                    had never interested people a great deal, and there was not a corps of people
                    who had served there and liked it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't dealing with an Iraqi mafia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, on the contrary. To even find somebody who knew anything about the
                    country you had to really scrape academia - really scrape at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did have people within the Foreign Service who had
                        served in Iran. Did you find that had time gone on and they'd moved
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They'd moved elsewhere; they had retired; or they were professionally
                    uninterested and did not want to be reminded they had served there. Iran had
                    burned too many people, I think. There is a corps of people who are retired who
                    were very interested and remain interested today, but at the time they were hard
                    to find. There, of course, were a lot of academics who were interested. It's
                    always attracted academia. At the time, people did not travel often to Iran.
                    Americans almost never went there. They couldn't get visas. And so no one's
                    knowledge was any good. In other words, there was no fresh knowledge. Either in
                    academia or in the State Department no one, like I said, in NEA, besides myself,
                    in the Department spoke Persian. I was the only one, except for Arnie Raphel,
                    who was our deputy assistant secretary. He had served there. He certainly didn't
                    speak it. He may have thought he did, but he did not. Other than that, he and I
                    were it in NEA, which was kind of surprising, given the fact that it was a major
                    country in the middle of a major war, which impacted on our oil interests. But
                    still, when I got there, what I discovered was that the office had almost no
                    contacts with anybody as far as Iran was concerned. They simply had not gone out
                    and met anybody. They did not even know the academics involved with Iran. I got
                    permission immediately to start dealing outreach with every possible political
                    group I could find, and I did it. That included everything from the People's
                    Mujaheddin, whom I met officially, up through the young Shah, and
                    representatives of all the other parties. The CIA had good contacts at the time.
                    The CIA had always kept their contacts going. They had activities going on. They
                    had a large office. The State Department had simply given up that particular
                    game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how the State Department seems to move...
                        If something doesn't work, it's just like we had this huge Vietnam office,
                        and then all of a sudden it was dissolved, and I think it was one guy in a
                        closet dealing with Vietnamese affairs after '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, the CIA had an operation in Germany and was training people in
                    the language and everything else. Of course, it was the biggest open secret in
                    Teheran, that this existed. The CIA always seemed to think that no one knew
                    about it, but everyone did. State had literally nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was going on in, first, Iraq, as you saw it
                        when you first took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Iraq had the war going. It had a total totalitarian system. The embassy
                    seemed to have little or no entr�e into Iraqi society or the politics. They were
                    allowed to meet with certain officials at certain times. Other than that there
                    was no great social whirl or friends with Iraqis or anything else.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the view of Saddam Hussein at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Actually, I think - I can't remember whether it was Kissinger or who
                    said something about that particular war, that Saddam Hussein and Khomeini
                    having a war with each other was basically for everyone else a win-win
                    situation. I think if you take away the veneer of, you know, tongue-clicking
                    about the evils of war, most people at State simply didn't give a damn and
                    thought that the Iraqis and the Iranis deserved each other. That expresses, I
                    think, what many people in the West felt - who cares?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were doing this, was there concern? As one
                        was looking at this in longer terms than day by day, what happens if Iraq

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There wasn't very much going on in the way of grand thinking. The war
                    seemed to... it had been going on forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any efforts made to say, Gee, even though you
                        don't like us, maybe we could mediate, or did we feel that because of Iran
                        we couldn't play a role at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, what we had going on there, things that would not have allowed us
                    to mediate - we had a convoy policy for our oiWe had reflagged a lot of Kuwaiti
                    oil tankers to make them American flag carriers to convoy oil in and out of the
                    Gulf. We were chiefly concerned about the flow of oil. Also, this was the time
                    when we shot down an Iranian airliner by mistake, so there was not even a remote
                    possibility that we could have served as a sort of disinterested, impartial
                    purveyor of good will. It wasn't going to happen. Almost nobody could. Between
                    the Iranians and the Iraqis, there weren't very many people that the two of them
                    trusted. The Iraqis are perpetually suspicious of everyone. The Iranians are
                    just about the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel at that time that the Soviets might be of any
                        value or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: If you're talking about the war, no, because we always wanted the
                    Soviets to stay out, not to get any positions of authority or any sort of renown
                    for being peacekeepers. If you go into the other subject of trying to get back
                    into the Iranian bedroom, there were countries that we felt could help us do
                    this. But that was different than trying to stop the war. We weren't trying to
                    stop the war. We had been supplying weapons to one side and intelligence to the
                    other side, and nobody really cared about the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about your experience at the time. How
                        did you learn about what became known as the Iran-Contra affair, the
                        supplying of arms? How did that -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>METRINKO: From the newspapers. And I only believed it because... Okay, let me put
                    it this way. I heard about it from Iranian friends, that the United States was
                    supplying weapons to Iran, and I would deny this all the time because I believed
                    they were laboring under delusions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you knew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And I knew - because I saw all the reports. And I had done talking
                    points incessantly on Operation Staunch. I had even gone to Europe, and I had
                    lectured the British and the Turks on Operation Staunch. A trip sanctioned by
                    Mr. Armacost himself. I knew the Truth. And when I saw the story - it first
                    cropped up in a Lebanese newspaper - and then I saw to whom it was attributed,
                    and I knew the people to whom it was attributed, and I knew that they would
                    know... and then I saw -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was attributed to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: To -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Iran -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, they attributed it to the son-in-law of Ayatollah Mohtazadi, who
                    was then an enemy of the regime of Iran. He had been displaced as successor to
                    Khomeini. When I saw that it was the son-in-law who was being accused of
                    spreading this story, I knew that this son-in-law would know. And then when the
                    story came out - it came out almost immediately, the sort of continuation of the
                    tale - of a chocolate cake in the shape of a key, that's when I believed it,
                    just because there was nothing at all in Iranian folklore, myth, or culture that
                    would allow them to create this story of a chocolate cake shaped like a key.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was national security advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The national security advisor went with a representative of the Israeli
                    Government with a representative of the CIA. It was great for the CIA. Avram
                    Nir, I think, from the Israeli side - and Ollie North! It was just bizarre.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any contact with the NSC prior to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, not really. I'd never heard of Ollie North until I came to that
                    job. He didn't figure in Polish politics at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about when you came to the job? Did Ollie North

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His basic focus was on the hostages in Lebanon, wasn't it?

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: For Nicaragua. And that seemed to work. It got them out. There was just
                    enough in it. He had the connections there. And that's one of the reasons, I
                    think, that the October Surprise allegations against the Reagan regime were
                    probably correct. There seemed to be a connection. There seemed to be a conduit
                    for dealing with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the October Surprise was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The October Surprise is an allegation that the Reagan campaign people
                    worked with representatives of the government of Khomeini to keep the American
                    hostages longer in Iran, past the election time, so that the election would go
                    against Carter. The allegations have never been proven. There is a logical chain
                    that points to it, but it's not quite clear whether it's bitter grapes on the
                    part of former Carter officials or whether it's true. And it probably won't be
                    known until the Iranians themselves start to talk, and they have not yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once this came out, that Ollie North and company had had
                        this connection and we were supplying things including Tow missiles, which
                        are anti-tank missiles, and airplane spare parts -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Airplane spare parts, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - because the Iranian Air Force was an American -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: American-built and American-supplied up until the revolution, and they
                    were slowly running out of all the great stuff they had in the warehouses.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For your job, what happened then? I mean, did that change
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, it meant that we had absolutely no credibility at all anywhere in
                    the world, so that if we were dealing with Europeans and wanted to talk about
                    policy toward Iran, they would simply snigger at us - and with good reason. It
                    also meant that the State Department was suddenly seen as not a player in the
                    Iran game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, “hope springs eternal...” We kept hoping that people would forget
                    that we had been so thoroughly ignored by the White House and the NSC. It was
                    kind of funny, because I remember at one point getting called up to the
                    Secretary's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be Secretary Kissinger at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, no. Kissinger had long since gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, excuse me - it would be Shultz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, but I was asked to write a draft of the testimony of the Secretary
                    as to what he had known and had not known in terms of Irangate. I said, “I was
                    in Poland. We have nothing in our files. The office did not know. Why doesn't
                    the Secretary write what he knew and did not know?” But no one thought this was
                    a good idea. They asked me to write it instead, so I basically did a standard
                    chronology. It was a bizarre time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, apparently, Shultz had been at meetings, and
                        certainly Weinberger was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. And they were dealing with Reagan, who never quite knew what he
                    knew and didn't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and he could deny things with a great deal of
                        credibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, he could.</p>
                <p>Q: Because he used to get pretty vague at times.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Around this same time I was sent off to actually talk to somebody we
                    thought was an emissary from the Government of Iran. I was supposed to go to
                    Europe and talk to him.</p>
                <p>I wrote a two- or three-page memo explaining in detail who the person was and
                    what we hoped to accomplish by this. That went up to the Assistant Secretary's
                    office. From the front office to the Under Secretary's office, it was pared down
                    to one page. Armacost got it, gave it to the Secretary in about two paragraphs,
                    and it was presented by the Secretary to the President at a Cabinet meeting. I
                    was called up by one of the staffers in the Under Secretary's office, who said,
                    “Do you want to see what the Secretary actually said to the President about
                    this?” It was an index card with three or four words on it and, you know, a
                    little initial scrawled on it that Reagan had okayed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How did this meeting come off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I decided the person didn't represent anything except his own
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there were an awful lot of these entrepreneurs,
                        weren't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, there were, all the time. There still are. In fact, the same
                    person surfaced just a couple of months ago, because I was asked about him, if I
                    knew him, again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, just an Iranian businessman who would like very much to be one of
                    the people who profits by bringing peace to the two countries. The woods are
                    filled with them, including a fair number of former American officials at this
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point, were the French or even the British playing
                        a role because there was oil and they wanted to sort of be the first to get
                        an opening? Were they playing their own game, in a way, of trying to get
                        into this market?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Everybody was playing their own game. Dealing with Iran is a
                    continuation of what we used to call “the Great Game,” between the Russians and
                    the British and others, the Japanese. The Japanese are our allies, for example,
                    in theory, and yet they depend for their life blood on oil that comes out of the
                    Persian Gulf. They had excellent economic relations with the Iranians. They had
                    in general good political relations with the Iranians. They didn't want that
                    jeopardized by us. We understood that, too. So they had their game to play,
                    which was far more important to them than many of the games we were playing
                    there. The British would have loved to sell defense equipment and other things
                    to the Iranians. We got involved in that, and they would keep making
                    presentations about how this or that does not really impact on Iran's war
                    capability, it's “just radar” - you know, things like that. The Germans also -
                    everybody was doing this. Everybody wanted to sell stuff to the two countries
                    that were at war. They did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting pretty good coverage of how the war was
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes and no. Everything that came out of Iran through the Iranian �migr�
                    community was twisted. If you were an �migr� in the United States or Europe,
                    then you had your own interpretation of Iran. None of the foreign embassies in
                    Iran were really good at reporting, or if they were, we weren't getting the
                    stuff really straight. We'd get visits, you know, from this British diplomat or
                    that West German diplomat or someone else who'd come in and talk to us and tell
                    us what he had just seen in Teheran. Much of it was puerile. Did we have a
                    really good sense of what was happening in Iran? Not really, no. Iraq? Certainly
                    not.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, we did have spy-in-the-sky photo stuff and intercept traffic and all
                    this. Were our military or our CIA giving you how the battle was falling, more
                    or less?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: We'd get a lot of reports on the number of people killed in this foray
                    or that front, nothing that would really tell us what the people were doing, how
                    they were feeling. You simply didn't get it in Iraq. It never came out. And in
                    Iran, you'd have contradictory reports all the time. Iranians are difficult to
                    pin down. Was the reporting good? There was a lot of it - NSA stuff, other
                    stuff, CIA stuff, this stuff, that stuff, stuff from foreign governments. Did I
                    ever really feel that I knew what was happening in Iran? No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iraq had an embassy. Did you have much contact with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, sure. I went there on national day, and they would come to the
                    office and see us occasionally, but meetings... They are not, warm, fuzzy, and
                    outgoing people. They are not about to start being buddies. They were cool,
                    correct. The ambassador, Hamdoun, was fine. He was a professional ambassador who
                    went on to become Ambassador to the United Nations, and he was correct in
                    meetings, but that was it. Iraq does not have a good history of treating its
                    officials well if they're suspected of being too warm towards other
                    countries.</p>

                        State Department and said, “We're not going to do this any more?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, I don't know how to answer that. The person at the NSC was
                    Bob Oakley, who was not one to sort of toss things away. It became... I don't
                    know what was going on secretly. I think they all felt they were badly burned.
                    I'm assuming they pulled out, because they were badly burned. The newspapers had
                    a field day. Congress had a field day. I don't think they would have dared to do
                    anything more anymore. Ollie North was fighting all sorts of lawsuits and
                    everything else at that point, investigations on investigations. I think they
                    got burned and stayed away. The only thing they ever seemed to do after that was
                    to put incessant numbers of qualifiers on any message we wanted to send to Iran.
                    We did a lot of back-and-forth messages, and every message, they would hang all
                    the Christmas tree ornaments on about eschewing terrorism and things like
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Covering their ass, yes. There would be a whole list of things that
                    they would put in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying these were messages that were going
                        through, what, the Swiss representation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Messages went through all sorts of people. The Swiss did some things
                    for us, and other people volunteered to take messages that various people wrote
                    without really clearing them. It was a real mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the revolution in Iran? Was the war sort of
                        putting the revolution on hold, or how were we seeing it in this '86-88
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The revolution was continuing. A major opposition group to the Khomeini
                    regime had gone to Iraq and had settled down there to fight against Iran. This
                    caused major problems for them, of course, because they were considered traitors
                    to Iran as well as anti-revolutionaries. They're still in Iraq now. It was sort
                    of the same thing that happened in the Soviet Union when World War II started,
                    where the Bolsheviks, the revolutionaries had to appeal to the old symbols in
                    order to get support. The Iranians had to start appealing to the flag, to the
                    concept of Iran as a country, to the concept of Iranian history. It had to pull
                    out a fair number of old symbols. It also had to resurrect a fair number of old
                    officers and bring them back. That emptied a lot of prisons to go and fight. All
                    of that was happening. Khomeini didn't much like this, of course. The clergy
                    didn't much like it, but they did have to resurrect a fair amount of the old
                    stuff because otherwise they might have lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was running the war? Was it Khomeini, or was it put in
                        the hands of the military, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, the clergy had a very prominent role in it. They got involved, but
                    the clergy have always been, in Iran, good administrators. They always have
                    been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding was - maybe it was earlier on - that at
                        least there were stories out there that they were turning the equivalent to
                        a lightly armed militia, they were going up against just sort of like the
                        Battle of the Somme in 1915.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Iranian Army had had huge problems, of course, in '78, '79, and '80
                    because of the revolution. A lot of the top echelon of officers had disappeared,
                    either run away or were in prison. In fact, everything from the basic junior
                    officers all the way up had been decimated. That included the air force, the
                    army, etc. But they pulled through somehow. In fact, losing a lot of the top
                    rank of officers may have been the best thing for the Iranian armed forces. A
                    lot of the top rank were worthless. They were buddies of the Shah. They were
                    buddies of the Shah's buddies. They were not chosen for merit; they were chosen
                    because it was a family system or a friendship system. People who gained their
                    expertise on the field in the first year of war gained it through merit and
                    managed to do a pretty good job. A lot of the war also was your standard old
                    stand-in-the-trenches-and-slug-it-out. It wasn't grand strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were there - you left NGA in '88 - was the
                        collapse of the Iranian military effort... did it happen on your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>METRINKO: There were discussions about it and constant reporting that it was
                    about to collapse, that it had collapsed. It never really did collapse. A peace
                    happened. It's hard to say that one side or the other won. It was more a matter
                    of simple exhaustion and too many losses on both sides. I guess you could say
                    that... Did Iraq win the war? Not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, when you look at it, they launched an
                        attack. It didn't work, and they spent eight years trying to make up for it,
                        and when it ended up, they all ended up in the same borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: With close to a million people less and war injuries and problems that
                    will go on for the next full generation. Sure. So nobody won it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Kurds? Did they play any role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, they lost it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get involved in that, or were we following it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Were we following it? No. We usually do not follow the Kurds in Turkey,
                    because that would offend our allies if we got interested. Therefore we ignore
                    everything the Turks are doing to their Kurds. In Iraq, the Iraqis went after
                    their Kurds big-time, used poison gas on their own Kurds. We knew about that. We
                    expressed the proper amount of outrage, which was at least oral, if not
                    heartfelt. Actually if I had to be a Kurd, I guess I'd prefer to be an Iranian
                    Kurd; you're less likely to be killed by the government. I would least like to
                    be a Turkish Kurd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For our point, this was just a struggle that was going on,
                        and it wasn't our business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We ignored it all the time. We used the Kurds, as we always have, as we
                    have for many, many years -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kissinger did at one time, and others have done it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We certainly used them after Kuwait, and other times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Kuwait? Did that enter into your province at
                        that time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, Kuwait wasn't handled in my office -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you must have been -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - but it was part of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - keeping an eye on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had to, just about daily, because we had a policy of convoying
                    Kuwaiti oil tankers that were given American registration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were, they brought you kicking and screaming back
                        to a Washington assignment - here you had probably the biggest war that had
                        gone on, a lot bigger than the Vietnamese War or anything else, but did you
                        feel that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There wasn't a great deal of interest in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - in the Near Eastern Bureau, I mean, this just wasn't on
                        our radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was on our radar only because we had so many defense forces assigned
                    to the Gulf to protect the oil flow, but it wasn't on our radar as being
                    interested in either country. It was as I said before, kind of a win-win
                    situation. Nobody cared that Iranians and Iraqis were slaughtering each other.
                    There was a general feeling that they probably deserved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what was the motivation in supplying
                        intelligence, mainly overhead intelligence, to the Iraqis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, the Iranians would say it was to keep the war going on longer,
                    because that was a point when the Iraqis seemed to be losing. Ditto for
                    supplying weapons to the Iranians. And the Iranians, people in the Middle East
                    who have plenty of conspiracy theories, look at all of this as the American way
                    of prolonging the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And really understanding what they were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, which is a terrible misunderstanding of America. I oughtn't to be
                    cynical. I don't know why, when the decision was actually made to provide
                    intelligence, what exactly was provided to the Iranians, or exactly why the
                    decision was made. I think the timing is just probably serendipitous or
                    misfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, talking about - the cruiser's name escapes me

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Vincennes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vincennes. When we shot down an Iranian passenger
                        plane with terrible loss of life - everybody was killed, a couple of hundred
                        - how did the news come to you? How did we deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We dealt with it by basically admitting that we had made a mistake, and
                    it was. I think for the first hour or so we all wanted to think we could get
                    away with this somehow, they way you have when there is an unfortunate incident,
                    what's the best spin? But at State people were, like, “You can't do this.” And
                    it was put to us very clearly immediately by the various organizations that deal
                    with airlines, “This is what happened. There is a legal process now, aside from
                    all the political process, for compensation, for other things, and this is how
                    it has to get done.” And people didn't try to escape what had happened. They
                    admitted what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember - somehow I can't recall our ever coming
                        up with a compensation package.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, no, we certainly did, a major compensation package. Now I think the
                    Iranian Government has refused to accept it. It was fairly major - we're talking
                    multi-multi-millions of dollars, based on each person getting so much. And the
                    Iranian Government would like to say, has tried to say, that we haven't, but it
                    was out there very quickly. And negotiations for it went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the peace or truce or whatever you
                        want to call it between Iran and Iraq happened, or did that happen
                        afterward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, the actual cease-fire, I was there. We did the reporting on that,
                    or the talking points and everything else. And then I left to go off to the War
                    College. I went off to the War College in the late summer of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, when you left, if you were to predict whither

                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They're about the same level now they were then. Lots of people on both
                    sides trying to reestablish something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, were you optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I think optimistic. The people back then felt there was a chance we
                    would be back together with Iran a lot more quickly. There were good reasons for
                    it. We had pretty good contacts with a lot of Iranians, a lot of Iranian groups.
                    We had a couple of ayatollahs visit Washington during this period. There was
                    reason to believe at one point that Khamenei, who's now known as the bad old
                    man, the spiritual advisor - he came to address the United Nations - we had good
                    reason to believe that he was going to believe he was going to give a sort of
                    “open hand” speech, or extend the possibility of the olive branch. I think we
                    had very good reason to believe that, and what happened is that as he arrived in
                    New York, an Iranian group of Revolutionary Guards took a launch boat and tried
                    to attack an American patrol boat with it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes - which a lot of people saw as a way to stop him from extending an
                    olive branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course we retaliated by blowing up a couple of

                <p>METRINKO: Yes, stuff like that.</p>

                        talking about 1988, and you went off to the War College. And we'll talk
                        about the War College at that point. Great.</hi>

                        if there was a rather promising window of opportunity for something to
                        happen and this squashed it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What had been going on up until this visit was that we had dealt with
                    innumerable attempts by innumerable Iranians claiming to represent the Iranian
                    Government who wanted to start talking to the American Government - the State
                    Department, the CIA, etc. - about the possibility of renewing relations or just
                    having serious discussions. This had been going on and on. Iranians came through
                    all the time claiming to be the doctor of this person, the best friend of that
                    person, that Khamenei or Khomeini or someone else had sent them to talk, much
                    like it is today, of course. When the General Assembly was about to convene, we
                    had indications that Khomeini was going to -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, gosh. I want to say head of the parliament, speaker of the
                    parliament. I could be wrong though because he's had several positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, he was certainly at that time -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - number two in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Number two, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. We had indications that Khamenei, who was heading the delegation
                    to the United Nations, was going to give a very moderate, almost warm and fuzzy
                    speech about Iran and the United States. We believed this enough, or our
                    indications were strong enough, that we actually tried to help his visit. For
                    example, when the Iranian delegation arrived in London, by arrangement, we sent
                    an American consular official on board the Iranian plane with the visa machine
                    to actually issue the visas right there on the plane. As far as I remember, he
                    was treated quite warmly on the plane by the Iranian officials. The Iranians
                    arrived. The speech was set for the next day or two days later, and an incident
                    occurred in the Gulf where a group of Iranian Revolutionary Guards, to the best
                    of my recollection, seized a patrol boat, launched it into the Gulf, and tried
                    to attack an American vessel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, these people had taken from the Iranian
                        Navy -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, they were not normal Iranian Navy - it was some other group. And
                    that started an incident that escalated immediately, and when Khamenei walked in
                    to give his speech, he was walking into an atmosphere of screaming from Iran
                    that we had attacked Iranians and screaming from here that Iranians had attacked
                    us. It was no longer possible, if he had ever wanted to, it was no longer
                    possible to give a moderate speech.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Mike, 1988-89 you went, what, to the National
                        War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: National War College, and I spent a year there. It was one of the best
                    years of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a bit about what you got out of it and your
                        feeling about how the military was training its leaders and all? This was
                        1988-89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The War College class that I was in had approximately 120 people in it
                    representing all the services, plus a fairly large contingent of civilians,
                    about 20 or so, a couple from AID, FBI, CIA. First, the War College itself is an
                    absolutely beautiful place, unlike most of the Department of State facilities.
                    It was beautifully set up and beautifully run, and like everyone else in the
                    State Department, I suddenly had the feeling that the personnel system and the
                    administrative staff at the War College actually cared about me. People were
                    polite, receptive, and helpful, very much unlike the personnel system, very much
                    unlike the support services from the State Department. People smiled; they said
                    “thank you”; they said “please”; they said “You're welcome;” they responded. The
                    courses were excellent. It was done seminar-style, six, seven, or 10 students
                    per course, and absolutely top quality. My fellow students were all lieutenant
                    colonels or the equivalent, colonels or equivalent, many of whom have gone on to
                    quite high ranks in the armed forces. What I enjoyed most about it was the
                    chance to finally learn something about the American Government other than the
                    Department of State. Because of the services that were represented, the agencies
                    represented, we had a lot of excellent discussions in a seminar setting. We also
                    toured different facilities in Washington and all around the United States. I
                    traveled with people from the military, went to bases all around the United
                    States and overseas. It was an absolutely wonderful eye-opening experience. It's
                    a shame that Foreign Service officers all can't go and all can't go at a much
                    earlier time in their careers. It's completely, absolutely positive. And I've
                    stayed in touch with people from that class since then, too, some of my military
                    friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, in '89, where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>METRINKO: In '89, what happened was that I was assigned as charg� to Kabul. We
                    did not have an ambassador there at the time. We had a charg�. The post had been
                    reduced in size, but it was still a functioning post. In the early spring my
                    assignment was close enough so that I had started to take Dari classes at the
                    Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dari is how close to Farsi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Dari is this close to Farsi. When I went over to FSI, I was introduced
                    to the Dari teacher in Farsi by the Farsi teacher, and I continued to speak
                    Farsi, and the Dari teacher and I went into a classroom and we sat and we
                    continued to talk for about an hour, and everything was fine, except that I
                    looked at my watch and thought, Gee, it's getting late, we'd better start. I
                    want to find out what I have to do to get started with Dari. So I asked the
                    teacher, in Farsi, I said, “When are we going to start Dari?” And he looked at
                    me and said, “I've been speaking Dari for the past hour. You've been speaking
                    Farsi.” I hadn't realized it. I thought he was speaking Farsi with an accent.
                    But it's very close. There are expressions, there's vocabulary that changes,
                    words, but in general it's very close.</p>
                <p>Now, I was assigned to Afghanistan. I was assigned part-time to FSI, going over
                    from the War College in the afternoons. Two things happened at this point. The
                    Secretary of State decided to close, temporarily, our mission in Kabul. My
                    understanding was that he had a choice of either closing Beirut or Kabul. He did
                    not want to close both. He wanted to close only one, lest it give the wrong
                    impression about our foreign policy in the Middle East, and he flipped a coin or
                    did the equivalent, and closed Kabul instead of Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation that would call for closing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Fighting, lots of tension, lots of sort of loud noises, you know, guns
                    and smoke in both places. The Dari Desk and the people in NEA said, “You're
                    still going to Kabul; we'll just wait until the Mujaheddin take the city, and
                    then you can go there immediately.” I knew what the Mujaheddin's chances of
                    taking the city were - zero at that point - and I couldn't believe that they
                    were so silly as to actually believe this was going to happen. The CIA was
                    pushing the Mujaheddin's impending victory as a-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Mujaheddin were different from the Taliban, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, completely different. The Taliban did not exist at that point. The
                    Mujaheddin were the old people whom we helped drive the Soviets out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was holding Kabul at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Kabul at that point was a mixture. The Soviets were leaving, and the
                    Mujaheddin were almost in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That happened, and almost exactly at that time, too, in February of
                    1989, my father passed away very suddenly. He had a stroke, died about a week
                    later. I realized fairly soon, that I would have to take my mother with me
                    wherever I went overseas. My mother went into an immediate fit of depression. My
                    brothers were not assisting at all. And I was left with full responsibility for
                    an aging invalid mother. So I came back to the Department. The Kabul position
                    had been put on hold temporarily. I was starting to seriously wonder whether I
                    could go to Kabul with my mother, when I got a call from Consular Affairs, and
                    the assistant secretary wanted to talk to me. I went up to see her, and she
                    asked me - she not knowing that I had been assigned to Kabul - if I might be
                    interested in going to Tel Aviv, which had just opened up. The incumbent in Tel
                    Aviv as consul general had asked to leave post early after one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, so you went with your mother.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I took my mother to Tel Aviv, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went to Tel Aviv. You were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was there from the summer of 1989 until the late summer of 1993. I
                    extended at post. I did a four-year assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to sort of round out the thing, did we open up our
                        embassy again in Kabul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's still not open.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: And that's been from 1989 until now, and the Mujaheddin have still not
                    taken over the city. And I'm sure all the CIA people who kept insisting it was
                    going to happen imminently, have now conveniently forgotten what they were
                    saying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go to Tel Aviv. First let's talk a bit about
                        the embassy, the ambassador, and here is a very high-powered embassy - it
                        always has been - what was sort of the atmospherics and the people who were
                        involved on the ground? Then we'll talk about the situation there and what
                        you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Our embassy in Tel Aviv, at least in those years, '89 to '93, was a
                    tortured place. How do I want to say this? It was four years of people with raw
                    nerves who were there for a variety... very few people were there for straight
                    old professional reasons, as in “I want a Middle East assignment; this looks
                    interesting.” We had American Jews who were there to rediscover what they
                    thought might be their homeland. We had American - how do I want to say this
                    word? - I don't want to say “fanatic” Christians, but American Christians who
                    were there to find Christ.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had a rather large number of Mormons there, because the Mormons
                    think of Israel as a fairly important place. It was a place where people went
                    for lots of reasons that had nothing to do with professionalism - religious,
                    psychological reasons. And it was a place where the word happy did not
                    exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador - Bill Brown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Bill Brown was the ambassador when I arrived. And he was the ambassador
                    there for approximately two and a half years after I got there. The DCM was Mark
                    Parris. He had just arrived at post about a month or so before I did. And of
                    course, what we had happening in the country was a full-blown Intifada. The
                    uprising was going on all around the West Bank and Gaza. This was at a time when
                    our relations with the Palestinians were not good and at a time when our
                    relations with Israel were not conducted by the embassy but conducted directly
                    out of Washington and New York, so the embassy was very often shunted aside when
                    it came to dealing with the Government of Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, how did sort of this religious mix of people,
                        particularly those who wanted to be in Israel to find their soul or their
                        roots or whatever the hell you want to call it, translate itself into a...
                        It sound like it could be a touchy situation, because almost anything you
                        said could be taken the wrong way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I'll put it this way. The embassy in Israel, the American staff, was
                    one of the most bigoted, prejudiced, racist, completely non-impartial groups of
                    people I had ever worked with, and that went in every direction. We had some who
                    were so pro-Arab they couldn't see straight, others who were so pro-Jewish that
                    anything the Government of Israel did was holy writ. That went all the way up to
                    and included the ambassador. It was an embassy of people who were basically not
                    very professional, and it was a depressing, unhappy place to be for many
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about your work there. No, let's talk
                        about the situation there. You say Intifada. What were you all seeing, and
                        how were you dealing with this, really, revolt of Palestinian rock-throwing
                        youth and military attempts to repress this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, it was an uprising by the Palestinian people, who were very, very
                    tired and weary of living in an area that could only be defined as apartheid in
                    full bloom and living as not even second-class citizens, but living as
                    non-people in an area controlled by a very oppressive, very heavy-handed Jewish
                    military presence. How did the embassy, how did this impact on my work? The
                    Consular Section was a big and busy one. I had more than 30 FSNs and, oh, I
                    think seven or eight FSOs. We were responsible for all consular affairs in Gaza,
                    which had more than a million Arabs, Palestinians, and to which we were not
                    supposed to go. We were responsible for all consular affairs, of course, in the
                    State of Israel. We were responsible for a fair amount of consular work in the
                    West Bank, and we were also responsible for much of the consular work in
                    southern Lebanon.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>Southern Lebanon is the easiest. I'll start there. Southern Lebanon was occupied
                    by the Israeli Army. Lebanese who lived in the so-called “security zone” could
                    not go to Beirut for consular services, and in fact in Beirut we did not have a
                    functioning consular section most of the time that provided consular services.
                    So if you were Lebanese, you went for consular services to Damascus or Cyprus.
                    If you were from south Lebanon, you came down to Israel and to the embassy. This
                    meant that if you were from south Lebanon, you did not speak, of course, Hebrew;
                    you spoke Arabic. Why was I dealing with the West Bank? In theory, the consulate
                    general in Jerusalem was responsible for consular services in the West Bank, but
                    the consulate general in Jerusalem was not accredited to the Israeli Government.
                    Therefore, whenever they had to deal with the Central Government of Israel, even
                    though that government was located by and large locally in Jerusalem, they would
                    have to contact the embassy for us to arrange appointments, for us to arrange
                    access or entr�e. If someone had problems - a Palestinian American, for example,
                    was put in prison in the West Bank - it was the embassy that had to arrange for
                    access by somebody from the consulate to go and visit, at least initially. We
                    had to arrange for appointments with the police. It went on and on like this. It
                    meant that I worked on a daily basis with the consular people from Jerusalem,
                    every day on the phone, constant visits there or their coming down to see us. We
                    did a lot of consular business together, as a matter of fact, just to make sure
                    that we kept the consular relationship going, despite the bad relations between
                    the embassy and the consulate. That coldness was never true of the Consular
                    Sections. We worked together constantly.</p>
                <p>The Gaza problem. Gaza is the Gaza Strip and the city of Gaza. We were
                    responsible, my section, for all consular affairs or all consular matters
                    related to the Gaza strip. There was an embassy ruling that said “No embassy
                    officer, unless he or she has an explicit permission on a case-by-case basis
                    from the ambassador or the DCM, can enter the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. So
                    this meant...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationale behind that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What was the rationale? The rationale was supposed to be “security
                    concerns.” This played very nicely into Israeli hands, because the Israelis thus
                    made sure that people from the American Embassy never went to the West Bank and
                    very rarely to Gaza, so that we did not have a good idea of what was happening
                    there. The consulate people from Jerusalem were allowed to go, of course, to the
                    West Bank. They did not go to Gaza at that point. This meant that even though
                    there were cities in the West Bank that were fine, easy, we could get there very
                    easily, we simply never went there - cities like Tulkarm, Jenin, and Nablus.
                    They were close. I could have been there in a 30-minute drive. I went there once
                    at night, for example. And I did more traveling than most of the people in the
                    embassy. In fact, I did far more than almost anyone else in the embassy. I was
                    always traveling around the State of Israel. I was frequently in Gaza,
                    frequently into the West Bank, but that was because I was doing consular work
                    and I was accompanying either consular people in Jerusalem or I got permission.
                    Soon I realized no one from the Consular Section had been to Gaza for a couple
                    of years before I got there... The head of USIA, for example, in the embassy in
                    Tel Aviv, whose name I have (thank goodness) forgotten, used to brag that he had
                    never been to Gaza and saw no reason to go there. He was fanatically pro-Israel.
                    I could not imagine anyone being that unprofessional and serving the United
                    States, that he refused to go into a whole area that was part of his
                    responsibility. But he was incredibly Zionist, to the point where it was
                    embarrassing to talk to him. And he later partially retired in Israel to a
                    kibbutz there. This was what was going on. It was a time for four years when
                    there were constant street problems. What's going on this week, for example, in
                    Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza with the uprising reinvigorated? What's going
                    on all the time there? We had shootings, we had bombings, we had large numbers
                    of people being hauled into prison. We had a lot of Americans getting caught up
                    in this. American protest groups came to Israel. They got arrested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were protesting on what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, in Israel itself - Israel, West Bank, and Gaza - we had at that
                    point something over 100,000 American citizens residing there. They were Jewish
                    Americans, they were Palestinian Americans, and there were a fair number of
                    religious-based Americans, Christians especially who were there as missionaries
                    or priests or nuns assigned to the various churches, monasteries, what have you,
                    hospitals, schools. We had groups coming in. For example, I remember at one
                    point when the Intifada was especially heavy, probably '92, I would guess, we
                    had a group of something like 30 or 40 Americans arrive. It was one of your
                    solid middle-class group of aging liberals who were going to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Children of the '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Who had gotten a little bit older. It included a few priests, nuns,
                    etc., that group, absolutely fine people who decided that they were going to
                    enter the West Bank despite the efforts of the Israeli police to stop them. So
                    they went up to the northern border of the West Bank and tried walking across,
                    near the Golan Heights, if I remember correctly. They all got arrested. We had
                    about 30 arrest cases in one night. What I did for that was... I knew that they
                    were going to have problems if they went up there. I had already assigned
                    consular officers, pairing them with FSNs, got them all set to go up and conduct
                    a whole series of prison visits that same night. They were arrested in the
                    evening; they all had prison visits from us that same evening. We sent out
                    approximately 30 arrest cables to the State Department that same evening, and by
                    the next day or so they were all released. This was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Something like this, I would imagine that... you know, normally if you have an
                    arrest case you've got to take care of it, and something like this, I would
                    assume that the ambassador would go up to somebody in the Ministry of the
                    Interior and say, “Are you out of your mind?”</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Bill Brown didn't give a damn, quite basically. He was extremely
                    pro-Israel. He hated Arabs, and he would say so. He only used the word Arab when
                    he hyphenated it with terrorist. He would say “Arab-terrorist” often in
                    conversation. He had little or no contact with Arabs in the area. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>Now what we had were constant arrests of American citizens, Palestinian
                    Americans, basically, by the Israeli armed forces, and a constant refusal by the
                    Israelis to inform us that Americans had been arrested. Approximately a month
                    after I arrived in Israel, two young Americans, aged 15 and 16 years old, were
                    arrested. Their arrests were reported to us by their family. They were first
                    cousins. And the Israelis denied, as they always denied, they had ever heard of
                    these two guys, the two young kids. They denied it, denied it, denied it. We
                    kept insisting. We knew that they had been picked up. The Israelis kept saying,
                    No, we don't have them. And then about a week later, the body of one of the
                    young boys was discovered, shot in the back, lying dead in a wadi - with Israeli
                    bullets, I might add. He'd been killed by the Israeli soldiers. There was a bit
                    of a brouhaha. Even the ambassador had to get a little bit involved, despite his
                    inclinations. What I did at that point was to go up to Ramallah, where the
                    Israeli army had a sort of command headquarters, with the mother and the young
                    sister of the other missing boy and basically sat in the office of the
                    commander. I was accompanied also by the head of the Consular Section from
                    Jerusalem, and we sat there until he finally told us that they had located the
                    other boy. And then we insisted on seeing the other boy and went up to the
                    prison that night to see him. But it was that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the boy tell you what happened to the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He had been picked up stone-throwing, and they had been separated after
                    they got picked up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: He didn't know what happened to his cousin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were both in Israeli custody, so it wasn't a

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, both in Israeli custody. The Israelis killed two American while I
                    was there. That was one. They also killed an old man, an American Palestinian
                    who had retired to the West Bank. He was in his home one evening, and Israeli
                    soldiers broke into the house, insisted that he clean graffiti off some walls on
                    the street. This man had a serious heart condition. He and his wife explained
                    that he had a serious heart condition, that he couldn't do any physical
                    activity. The Israeli soldiers made him drag a ladder out, made him ascend the
                    ladder. He died of a heart attack. Reaction from the American Congress: zero,
                    zero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that - in the consular regulations,
                        all of this stuff normally arouses all sorts of reporting on it - there were
                        sort of “world rules” and “Israeli rules,” and Israeli rules were different
                        than treating anywhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had the impression throughout my four years serving as consul general
                    in Tel Aviv, that the Department of State, NEA, and the Department of State,
                    Consular Affairs, did not give a damn about American citizens who were
                    Palestinian in Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza - that if they could keep it out
                    of the news that was fine, that they weren't going to do anything to rile the
                    Israelis. That was my feeling throughout the time.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a feeling, too, that you were being monitored, in a way, both by
                    the Israeli intelligence service and by friends of Israel in the United States
                    to see whether you were politically correct on Israel all the time?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Absolutely, completely. Monitored isn't the word - watched constantly.
                    And - how do I want to say this? - threatened, professionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would this go?</hi>

                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I'll give you an example. There was a point when... When did this
                    happen? We were between ambassadors at the time. We had a DCM who was very good,
                    Kent Wiedeman. The Israelis had arrested an American Palestinian, and the
                    Israeli military spokesman declared him guilty of all sorts of terrorist
                    activities, claimed that he had been bringing money and using money for
                    terrorist activities in Israel. I complained to the Israeli Government that the
                    person had been arrested, he had not been tried and found guilty, and said that
                    I considered it inflammatory and unprofessional, etc., for Israeli Government
                    officials to be acting as though he were a tried and convicted criminal, that he
                    was still pretrial status. The Israeli lobby got in touch with Ed Djerejian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about APAC, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Somebody from APAC called up Ed Djerejian, who was then the Assistant
                    Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs and complained to him that I had gone beyond,
                    that I was going too far. I was warned by the State Department to back down.
                    That was fine. Now about three or four days later, there was a small piece in
                    the Israeli press about what was the Israeli Government's... Oh, Ed first had
                    told Consular Affairs and told the embassy that he would raise this issue. Ed
                    told Consular affairs that he would take care of the issue because we were
                    trying to get access to this man and everything else, and here the Israelis had
                    declared him guilty of terrorism. Ed had said that he would take care of it,
                    that he would raise the issue and that he would treat it very seriously. In the
                    Israeli press a few days later, there was a small article about someone who had
                    just met with Ed Djerejian, and the reporter asked him, did he raise the issue
                    of I think the man's name was Saleh, if I'm not mistaken - of Saleh, the
                    American terrorist, whatever, and the Israeli official laughed and said, “Yes,
                    he did. He brought it up at lunch, but it's not very serious. We just laughed
                    about it.” And I wanted to send that newspaper article to the Department. Our
                    front office stopped me, and they said it would just annoy Ed. That's the way it
                    was handled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought working under these conditions... You

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Israel's a fascinating place. Israel is four or five million
                    individuals, not one of whom is boring. I never had what I would say was a happy
                    day in Israel, but I never had a boring day. I would rather be interested and
                    have interesting work than just sit back and be content. Individuals in Israel,
                    whether they are Jewish, Christian, Muslim, whatever - the individuals there
                    were fantastic. I had a huge number of what I consider friends. I knew most of
                    the grand rabbis in Israel. I knew them well. I used to go to their homes. I had
                    access to an incredible array of Israelis, both the religious, the ultra
                    orthodox, the non-religious, the military, and I have no problems with
                    individual Israelis. It was our way of dealing with them, with the State
                    Department, that gave me problems.</p>

                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Absolutely. It was more than a feeling; it was an absolute certainty.
                    And people there knew, too, or we strongly suspected, that if you did anything
                    that was too out of line it would affect your career. NEA was not going to back
                    you up - never. Consular Affairs was certainly not going to back up anybody.
                    Consular Affairs at that point was headed by - Oh, gosh, what was her name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joan Clark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, Joan Clark had left. Joan Clark was fantastic. She's the one who
                    sent me to Tel Aviv. She left shortly afterwards. The political appointee from
                    New England, whose name I -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. And she got into deep kimchi, as they say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The suspected Clinton passport application. What was her name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It'll come. But she's from New Hampshire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: New Hampshire. She came to Israel when I was there. It was an amazing
                    trip. This gave me an indication of the sort of leadership we had from the
                    Department of State and Consular Affairs. Let me go back a moment. I am talking
                    about a time when we did not have, at least initially, for the first two years I
                    was there, daily contact with Consular Affairs. Today, everybody is on e-mail.
                    Today, you can communicate all day long, very easily leave messages. At the time
                    I'm talking about, you had to send telegrams. Therefore, anything you sent had
                    to be cleared unless it was a standard visa cable or a standard congressional.
                    It had to be cleared by the front office. You couldn't go back with questions
                    about policy, questions about support, questions about how far can I go, how far
                    can you go, will you help me on this? Because it would have to go through the
                    front office. Therefore there wasn't that good a support system in place
                    yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>I extended in Israel. I did it for personal reasons as well as professional
                    reasons. My mother was living with me. She was diagnosed in Israel with cancer.
                    I had a choice. I could either leave Israel immediately - this was my second
                    year there - to get her back to the United States for treatment, or I could
                    start treatment in Israel. She and I decided after talking to doctors there to
                    let her go through the treatment there. We paid for it out of our own money,
                    instead of using her insurance in the United States, but the doctors were
                    excellent. Her chief doctor had been at Sloan-Kettering in New York. He went
                    over the potential expenses of medical care. He said, “Look, by the time you
                    finish the entire series of cobalt radiation treatments, it will cost you as
                    much to pay for everything here as you would pay in incidentals if you were in
                    the United States.” So we decided to stay. Because we were going to stay, we had
                    to stay for a longer period of time than my original assignment would have
                    lasted. I asked for an extension to give us four years and thus to be able to
                    take a long R&amp;R right in the middle. So it worked out.</p>
                <p>To go back to the assistant secretary of state. The day I came back from
                    R&amp;R... It was home leave, one of the first times in the State Department
                    that I was actually able to get home leave from a post. It was great. I had a
                    month off. About two weeks before I was due to go back, the assistant secretary
                    announced that she was going to Israel on a visit. Fine. She arrived in Israel
                    the day after I did from home leave, but my assistant had done everything, and
                    everything was fine. The Assistant Secretary was Betty Tamposi, Elizabeth
                    Tamposi. She wasn't interested in going to the Consular Section. She wasn't
                    interested in seeing it, and she wasn't interested in meeting any of the FSNs.
                    She was interested enough to meet the American officers at someone's home over a
                    brunch, and then I drove her and her special assistant up to Jerusalem, where
                    she was going to meet with the people from the consular section there. In the
                    car going up, she turned to me and said, “Michael, you've been in the Holy Land
                    for a long time now. Have you ever met the Blessed Virgin Mary?” I know, I can
                    see the expression on your face. I looked at her, and I thought first that I was
                    still going through jet lag, because I had just arrived the day before from a
                    24-hour trip back. And I said, “Excuse me?” And she said, “Well, have you ever
                    met with the Blessed Virgin Mary?” And I said, “I'm not sure what you mean.” She
                    said, “Well, you know, she's been appearing so many places. She's been appearing
                    in Yugoslavia, and she's been appearing at that apartment in Maryland” - that
                    was news to me. She said, “I thought that since this was her home she might have
                    appeared here and that you'd had a chance to talk to her.” I looked at her
                    special assistant, who averted his eyes immediately and stared out the window.
                    And I just said, “No, I'm sorry, I never have.” Fine, fine. We got up to
                    Jerusalem. Before I could warn the head of the section up there about this,
                    Donna got into the car, and Betty Tamposi -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Donna - ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Donna Sherman, an absolutely wonderful, superb officer who died later
                    in Cairo, absolutely fantastic officer. Donna got in the car and Donna was a
                    rather large woman and very expressive. She sat down, and Betty Tamposi turned
                    toward her and said, “Donna, I'm so glad you're here. I'm glad to meet you.” She
                    said, “You know, I wanted to ask you, you're up here in Jerusalem. Have you had
                    a chance to talk to the Mother of God?” And Donna looked at her, and then turned
                    and looked at me, and her eyebrows went all the way up in the air, and I just
                    shrugged, and Donna said, “Well, no, not really.” Fine. We get out to the church
                    in Bethlehem. The church in Bethlehem, by the way, was the whole reason Betty
                    Tamposi was in Israel. She didn't seem to care about the consular sections in
                    either place. She wanted to see the church in Bethlehem. We got up to the church
                    in Bethlehem, and the priest whom Donna had arranged to give the tour of the
                    church walked over, and the first question Betty Tamposi said was,
                    “Father...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ha, ha, ha, ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I asked her special assistant later, “What is going on here? Is she
                    flipped, or what?” He said, “She's been under a lot of stress.” She was indeed
                    under a lot of stress. Not long afterward she went
                    passport-application-hunting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and it became quite a political scandal in 1988 - no,
                        it was the 1992 election. She was looking for dirt in the passport files
                        against Bill Clinton.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: To see whether or not he had actually ever gone to the Soviet Union on
                    a visit when he was a student at Oxford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, I think even there was a rumor that he might
                        have attempted to renounce his citizenship over the Vietnam War.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>METRINKO: But that was the kind of support we got from the Department of State.
                    Now, having said that, we did get support in one area. They were absolutely
                    afraid to get involved with Arab-Americans. They were, however, very interested
                    in the problem of the Black Hebrews, and the Black Hebrews are one of the most
                    fascinating consular cases I've ever dealt with. The Black Hebrews, or the
                    Hebrew Israelite Community, were a group of about 1200 black Americans who had
                    migrated to Israel with a charismatic cult leader. His name was Ben Ami Carter.
                    Ben Ami Carter had been a bus driver in Detroit, if I remember correctly, who
                    had had a vision back in the time when black groups were becoming Muslim -
                    Mohammed X, etc. Ben Ami had decided that he was really Jewish, and he had a
                    series of visions and dreams that led him first to go to Liberia looking for the
                    promised land, and then, when he decided that Liberia was not his place, he went
                    to Israel, went in as a tourist, settled down in a small area not too far from
                    the Negev Desert. His followers started to come. And his followers were a very
                    strange group of people. We had, among others, the hairdresser from The Supremes
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Supremes being a popular singing group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I guess we do have to explain The Supremes, don't we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, we're talking about history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: 1966-67. We had the daughter of a bishop. We had a lot of solid,
                    middle-class black Americans who had migrated to Israel and claimed to be going
                    in as tourists and had simply settled there around their leader. Now, the group
                    was a strange group. They dressed in their version of ancient Hebrew/African
                    clothing - long robes, turbans, beautifully embroidered, beautifully colored
                    robes. They looked like what you would envision an Orientalist view of the
                    Middle East circa the year zero. They were vegetarians. They were vegan
                    vegetarians - no meat, no dairy products. They had come in without the Israeli
                    Government really knowing what was going on. They had come in in dribs and drabs
                    and ones and twos and threes and fours, and suddenly the Israelis turned around
                    and realized there were more than a thousand of this community living in a town
                    on the edge of the desert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was their money coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Good question. Well, some of them were escaped felons from the United
                    States. They had done bank robberies and things like that. There were a number
                    of convictions outstanding for credit card fraud. They had a large... But those
                    were the... Right now I want to say I've always thought those were the
                    exceptions, a couple of people who had done financial crimes at a time when a
                    lot of young black Americans thought that getting the man was okay. It goes back
                    to a time in our history of ultra-ethnic nationalism, ultra-racial nationalism,
                    in the '60s. The money they raised in the United States - they had a large
                    number of followers in the United States - they raised the money. People who
                    went to the community would sell their property and bring the proceeds with
                    them. They also raised money in Israel. They worked illegally in Israel. They
                    made jewelry. They took care of people's houses. They did other things, bits and
                    pieces of work.</p>
                <p>Now, what was the situation when I got there? When I had my long conversation
                    with Joan Clark prior to going out to Tel Aviv, she explained about the group to
                    me. She said, “Look, we don't want another Jonestown” - Jonestown being a
                    settlement, a community of Americans who were living in Guyana under the
                    leadership of a somewhat similar cult leader, Jim Jones. They committed suicide
                    en masse, or were murdered, depending on the version. But several hundred or a
                    thousand -</p>
                <p>Q: I think we're talking of around 800. There was a mass suicide sort of coerced
                    murder. They all drank poison.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: And what was going on in Israel at this time, in 1989, was this. The
                    Israeli Government wanted these people out. They were illegal in Israel. They
                    had no residence permits. They could not work legally. They were existing on
                    charity, handouts of money. They were suspected by the consular section of
                    mistreatment of children, to the point of almost torture of children, of
                    coercion, of forcing people to stay in the group, in the community, not allowing
                    people to break out of the cult. There were requests from the United States.
                    People couldn't locate family members who had joined the cult. They couldn't
                    communicate with them. In order to avoid deportation, the entire community had
                    renounced their American citizenship. Therefore, everyone from the leader on
                    down to young children was stateless, and children who were being born - and
                    there were lots of children being born down in the community - were all being
                    born stateless. Israel does not grant citizenship based on birth on the land of
                    Israel. And they no longer had American citizenship, either of the parents, so
                    the children were being born stateless, which was something awful to contemplate
                    down the road. They had highly annoyed the Israeli religious communities and the
                    Israeli Government. They practiced polygamy, which was biblical, but not legal
                    in Israel. And they just looked “other;” they looked different. They were black
                    Americans wearing long robes and turbans who thought that they were the only
                    true Jews and told the Israelis that they were the true Jews and not the
                    Israelis and that the Israelis had gone astray, period. Okay.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>Joan Clark said, “We don't want another Jonestown. Whatever you do, please go
                    down there, get that straightened out. That's what we have to do.” My
                    predecessor, for reasons I don't understand, had cut off all relations with the
                    group. He didn't want to see them. Once they renounced American citizenship he
                    didn't want them in the Consular Section. There was a serious problem because
                    they needed help. It took about three years, but working with the Israeli
                    Government, the Ministry of the Interior especially, working with the
                    Jewish-American Congress and a wonderful, intelligent, prescient rabbi who was
                    the head of it in Jerusalem, who saw this as a bombshell for American-Israeli
                    relations, working with the community itself, working with the State Department,
                    we got it solved. It took forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come up -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, the final arrangement was this. The Black Caucus, number one, was
                    threatening -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, the Black Caucus in Congress was threatening retribution against
                    Israeli interests in Congress if the Israelis did anything to this group. That
                    was fine. The Israelis, nonetheless, were trying to get the group out of Israel.
                    They thought they were responsible for every crime that had occurred in the
                    State of Israel. First, I made it a priority to establish relations with the
                    community. I think the first of second day I was in Tel Aviv, I told my chief
                    FSN, I said, “Please call them up, tell them I would like to come down and pay a
                    courtesy call.” And that news was greeted with absolute dead silence, and then
                    after a couple of days, “Yes, we'll be happy to receive him.” So I went down
                    there and played it straight. “I don't care if you renounced your citizenship or
                    not. I'm still the American Consul General, you still have ties to the United
                    States, and I'm just here to see if there's anything I can do for you.” I went
                    over all the problems with them, welcomed them, established a relationship to
                    the point where they started coming back to the consulate, to the embassy, when
                    they needed help, especially for repatriation, especially the younger children,
                    if they could get away from the community and wanted to go back - because very
                    often they had a mother or a father in the United States. There were a lot of
                    divided families in the community. Working with the Jewish-American Congress,
                    convincing the Israeli Government that they had to go easy, and over the course
                    of time, worked out a wonderful deal, where the State Department, Consular
                    Affairs, looked at the whole questions of the renunciations and decided that,
                    except for the top leadership, everyone else had been coerced into renunciation,
                    therefore they were not valid renunciations. Therefore, they could be given
                    their passports back. We even hired a PIT -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A part-time intermittent employee.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>METRINKO: We hired a part-time employee just to issue passports. We had to issue
                    more than 1000 passports, and they all had to come in and go through the
                    renunciation of the renunciation ceremony and make sure that everything was on
                    the dotted line. Now we did all this working with the leadership, and the
                    leadership were being excluded. At the same time, working with the Israeli
                    Government and the Jewish-American Congress, we got the Israeli Government to
                    agree to give them residence permits, which gave them permission to work in the
                    country if they got their American passports back. The Israelis wanted to be
                    able to deport them if they had to, but promised they would not unless in an
                    individual case they had a serious reason to. So the Israelis gave them
                    residence permits. We gave them their passports back, and we actually got the
                    Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration in the State Department to give a
                    million-dollar grant through IOM, the International Organization for Migration,
                    to this black American community. Now they were American refugees, American
                    citizen refugees, but on the books all of this was absurd. In fact, it was
                    wonderful. We used the million dollars to pay some of the community's debts to
                    the municipality of Dimona. Dimona was the Negev town where they were living.
                    They had not paid their electric bill or their water bill in lord knows how many
                    years. They paid off their bill, made the municipality deliriously happy. We
                    also used the rest of the money, through IOM, to build a school, and the
                    Department of Education in Israel agreed to fund the teachers, hiring people
                    from the community to be teachers in the school. There were a lot of certified
                    teachers there. So what we had, as I approached my last couple of months at the
                    embassy, were 1200 new black American citizens living in Dimona being
                    rediscovered by the Israeli press as sort of an interesting ethnic composition
                    down there, being rediscovered by the tour buses, so that tour buses would pass
                    by and say, to American foreign tourists, “And there is a community of...” you
                    know, da-da da-da.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they sell trinkets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And they would sell trinkets, and they would sell little pieces of
                    silver jewelry, and they would walk around in their wonderful robes. And they
                    started coming on Israeli TV. They were superb entertainers. They had used their
                    methods of cultural expression, singing and dancing, in their services, and they
                    could sing...</p>
                <p>They had taken a sort of Christian Gospel approach to music and applied it to
                    Judaism. It was sort of really “out there.” And they were getting awards, and
                    they were going to jazz festivals and everything else, and working out.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>Now, this still left the leadership. The leadership were a different kettle of
                    fish. Several of them had outstanding federal warrants. They had renounced their
                    citizenship. Nobody liked the leadership. I did. They were fine. They were my
                    kind of people. They had all been rebels, and they were okay. They were okay
                    with me. They did not have their citizenship because they were the ones named by
                    the other 1100 or whatever as the people responsible for forcing them to give up
                    their citizenship. What we did was, I helped them write sort of mea culpa
                    explanations about pressures of society, politics, fear of being deported, etc.
                    that had made them do this. And once again, the State Department came through
                    and sent us permission to reissue passports, and one of my last official acts
                    there was to able to present his new American passport to the Messianic head of
                    this community. It was great. He came up to the office, and we had a
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, let's talk about another group of Americans I think
                        would be much more difficult, and this would be the Jewish Americans, highly
                        orthodox, maybe Hasidic, maybe not, but of that ilk, who went to Israel, who
                        often seem to be the spearhead of extreme Israeli nationalism.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Orthodox Judaism covers a spectrum of religion. You have the
                    ultra-orthodox, you have the orthodox, you have the Zionist orthodox, and you
                    have the anti-Zionist orthodox, just to name a few. There were a couple of
                    orthodox groups, highly ultra-orthodox groups, that did not accept the existence
                    of a State of Israel, for example, the Satmer group. The Satmer grand rabbi
                    lives in New York City. I had met the Satmer grand rabbi in my old days in
                    Poland, when I hosted him on a visit there once. The Satmer grand rabbi dealt
                    directly, as far as I remember, with the Palestinians. His belief, and the
                    belief of his followers, was that the State of Israel can exist only when the
                    Messiah comes; therefore, anything claiming to be a state, in the absence of the
                    Messiah, is not real. It is an illegal organization. So we had lots of Satmers,
                    and I was on very good terms with the Satmers. They would help me a great deal
                    with other orthodox groups. You had the Vishnitzer and you had the Bostoner and
                    you had the Lubavitcher. The Lubavitcher grand rabbi, the rebbe, as he was
                    called, lived also in New York. In fact, he died when I was in Israel. I had a
                    chance to meet him in New York. I paid a call on him, which was fairly highly
                    publicized. The Lubavitchers were sort of like missionary ultra-orthodox. They
                    felt it was their job to reconvert Jews to true Judaism. They were great. The
                    Lubavitchers actually had an emissary to the embassy who would come in once a
                    week to see me, and he and I would sit down for at least an hour every Friday
                    morning and discuss Israel, Judaism, and various parts of Jewish law, Jewish
                    dietary law, etc. I used to go to his home quite frequently, and I made sure
                    that I took my whole consular staff out to visit their community. Every new
                    group of people went out to visit them. I knew most of the grand rabbis in
                    Israel, and I knew a number of those who were living in the United States
                    because their groups have traditionally lived in the United States. They had an
                    interest in knowing me because they had to deal with the Consular Section
                    constantly. Many of them were American citizens, including some of the grand
                    rabbis. They needed passports. They needed certificates for this, notarials,
                    etc., etc. Their wives and children needed passports and needed documents. If,
                    for example, the Satmers did not like the State of Israel or did not admit to
                    its existence, they certainly had no problems about the government of the United
                    States. That was their country. That was a legal government. Therefore, they
                    always wanted to be sure their American documents were in order, because that's
                    how they lived and traveled. If they weren't American citizens, the members of
                    the ultra-orthodox groups, the ones who followed the grand rabbis, were
                    interested in going to the United States to visit the grand rabbis. The
                    Lubavitcher rebbe had a court in New York, in Brooklyn, to which hundreds and
                    hundreds, if not thousands, of people went every week. Everyone in Israel who
                    followed him - and there were many thousands - traveled to the United States to
                    visit him, to ask questions, just to go and look at him. And so it was incumbent
                    on the Lubavitcher community to have good relations with the embassy. We had
                    excellent relations. And that went all up and down. There was a very
                    ultra-orthodox group that ran a medical charity. I went down to Beni Brak, where
                    they had their center, visited them there. They were very impressed. They ran a
                    medical charity where they would match up people in Israel who needed emergency
                    medical treatment and could not be treated in Israel with doctors in hospitals
                    all around the world, but especially in the United States. And if you qualified
                    for this program, if you were a child with a bad heart or something like that
                    and could not be treated in Israel, this group would pay for everything. They
                    would arrange for your passport, arrange for your visa, arrange for your medical
                    transportation, arrange for a member of your family to accompany you, arrange
                    for a place in the United States to stay, arrange for kosher food, arrange for a
                    doctor and all the hospitalization in the United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was wonderful. They had a huge warehouse of free medical equipment.
                    If you needed a wheelchair you could go there and get one and bring it back, or
                    not bring it back, as the case might be. But I was on good terms with them, and
                    because I knew so many of them, they introduced me to others, to the point where
                    my Jewish staff, a lot of them were offended that I was on such good terms with
                    the ultra-orthodox community. There are large gaps between the ultra-orthodox
                    and regular secular Jews. Not only gaps, there's a great deal of enmity,
                    hostility.</p>
                <p>But you talked about American Jews who came there for nationalist reasons,
                    Zionists. Yes, they existed. I did not have very much personal contact with
                    them, because they were basically living up in the West Bank. They were
                    settlers. The American Jews who lived in Tel Aviv or up and down the coastline
                    were a bit laid back. They were there for family reasons, professional reasons.
                    They had gotten citizenship one way or the other. They tended to be very well
                    educated. There was a large contingent of retired Americans, and a lot of these
                    people were my friends. I'd go to their houses for dinner; they'd come to my
                    house. We'd see each other. We'd go on trips together. I'm still in touch with a
                    lot of them. The last time I saw anyone like this was about a month ago here,
                    when two of them came from Tel Aviv, were visiting Washington, I took them out
                    to dinner. They tended to be more liberal, more live-and-let-live, than the type
                    you're talking about on the West Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that these people, the type I'm
                        talking about, the extreme nationalists, were in a way sort of a cutting
                        edge of the right wing of the Likud Party, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, they go beyond Likud. In my mind it's so far gone - I'm trying to
                    think of the name of the party that was so famous. It's just slipped my mind
                    right now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. No, not Shaz. I just can't think of it. It was declared illegal in
                    Israel anyway. I would see these guys occasionally when they were arrested. And
                    we did have American Jews who were arrested, a steady stream of American Jews,
                    usually for murder, for murdering Arabs. They tended not to stay in jail long.
                    If you were picked up... it's funny, if you were Arab and you killed a Jew, you
                    would go to jail forever. If you were Jewish and you killed an Arab, it was a
                    temporary stay.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Oh, very much. It was worse than the deep South - the deep South in the
                    United States, say 1920 or 1930, yes, very much, absolutely. But... Oh, good
                    Lord, all the names are going, thousands of Hebrew names are going through my

                <p>METRINKO: Extreme Christianity, a lot of religion in Israel in that area is
                    extreme. If you scratch anybody there you're likely to get a fanatic at one
                    point or another. The extreme religious Christians tended to be up in Jerusalem,
                    and they were specifically a Jerusalem problem. I didn't have to be bothered
                    with them very much. In fact, I don't think I ever even met one. I dealt with a
                    fair scattering of American clergy, your standard Roman Catholic monks and this
                    and that and nuns who worked in Israel for good professional reasons. It dealt
                    with visitors who were there for religious purposes, but none of the Christian
                    fanatic types.</p>

                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Gulf War was interesting. As we started to build up to the Gulf
                    War, the United States had laid an ultimatum down: the Iraqi forces had to leave
                    Kuwait or there was going to be trouble. I instituted a policy in the Consular
                    Section of burn, of getting rid of documents, which nobody could understand, but
                    I simply said it's from my experience in Iran. I don't know what's going to
                    happen here, but we might as well go through old files. It's time for it anyway.
                    The embassy had a series of meetings. It was handled pretty well by the
                    ambassador, by the DCM. A series of meetings to go through the various emergency
                    evacuation things and this and that - thank goodness, because it was amazing how
                    ignorant many of the American officials are about emergency procedures. And we
                    went through a series of who's essential to embassy operations, and it was
                    rather funny, when consular sections are often looked down on as not being on
                    the cutting edge of anyone's embassy, in one of the meetings I had the economic
                    counselor say, “Well, nothing we do here is essential in the Economic Section.
                    We could all leave tomorrow and nobody would notice. I can't really say that
                    anything I've done as an economics officer has been essential to running an
                    embassy.” Well, as it turned out, by the time push came to shove, we ended up
                    with the ambassador, the DCM, one person from USIA, one political officer,
                    nobody from the Economic Section, and the entire Consular Section, including all
                    the FSNs. And we ran a 24-hour shift in the Consular Section, for the first
                    several days, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the first several days of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The first several days of when the Iraqis actually... we started to
                    bomb the Iraqis and they started to retaliate and bomb Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These Scuds were coming in, these rather inaccurate
                        missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: If you're going to get hit by a missile, it doesn't matter if you are
                    targeted with finesse or by mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, they just drop it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And in effect, it's better if they're targeted well because then you
                    can stay away from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard stories about when all of a sudden the going
                        got rough, an awful lot of groups like both who had been posturing and all
                        this all of a sudden decided it was time to get the hell out of Israel and
                        head for back to the States. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>METRINKO: This was a funny time, a very funny time. First, a lot of Israelis
                    simply ran away. If there had ever been the old, you know, Leon Uris myth of
                    Exodus and everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the '48 War and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, all Israelis are brave and heroes and all that. They took off like
                    rabbits. They disappeared. They ran. I mean, it was almost funny to watch. To
                    give you an example of how many people ran, the local newspaper decided to send
                    a reporter to an old-age home in Tel Aviv to see how people who had gone through
                    World War II in Europe were faring now. They got to the old-age home, and all
                    the pensioners were still there, but there was no staff. All the doctors, all
                    the nurses, all the administrators had taken off. The only people who were there
                    taking care of the old people were the Arab char force. And this was reported in
                    the newspapers, that the entire Jewish staff had deserted the hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They went to the United States, they went to Europe, they went off to
                    various kibbutz's, they went up to Jerusalem. They just disappeared. Streets in
                    Tel Aviv were empty. One of my consular officers, who lived about a block from
                    me, one night there was a knock on his door, and a man looked at him and said,
                    “You and I are the only two people who have stayed on this entire street. Would
                    you like to come to dinner?” The mayor of Tel Aviv stood up early on, the first
                    day or so or the second day of the Scuds, and started to talk about how all the
                    people who are running away are cowards and traitors, and someone said, “Where
                    is your son?” His son had run away, and he had to stop talking like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told the Israeli television sort of relished showing
                        people dressed as orthodox Jews getting on the planes and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, it wasn't only that, it was everybody, and you know, a lot of
                    people came to Israel at the same time, but they tended to be Americans who
                    thought that they were somehow going to help Israel. It was a mixed bag. I had
                    friends who stayed. A lot of my friends stayed. I can't say that it was the
                    orthodox who left or the seculars who left or this group or that group. A lot of
                    people stayed, but far more left.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>Now, the State Department. The State Department was fairly supportive in a stupid
                    way. Consular Affairs was not really geared up to assist us, I would say. We had
                    done everything possible. We certainly had made it known... Well, in Israel it
                    was never possible to have what consular officers refer to as the “warden
                    system.” In Israel and the surrounding areas, we had 120,000 American citizens
                    residing there, and we had at any given day many, many thousands of tourists. In
                    Israel there are English newspapers that are pretty good. There are English
                    broadcasts on television, English news. You had access to English on the radio,
                    and certainly, the Israeli Government was making every possible announcement
                    about what's going on. Also CNN was making every possible announcement, and you
                    could get CNN in Israel at that point. So there was no way that any American who
                    was there could say that he or she was not notified of what was happening. The
                    buildup had been international press for about two months. Everybody knew this
                    was happening. In fact, the Israelis were so well organized that tourists had
                    access to gas masks. Hotels passed them out to anyone who was staying for the
                    night. The airport in Tel Aviv never closed. The American liners weren't coming
                    in, but El Al was coming and going every day with direct flights to the United
                    States, and we had a deal, an arrangement with travel agencies. We had set up a
                    small consortium of travel agencies, five or six. Any American who called the
                    Consular Section during this period, during the first week or two, who wanted to
                    leave Israel, we could get them a regular seat on an outgoing flight. If they
                    called up and they had had trouble getting through to the airport, we had the
                    emergency numbers, the sort of unpublished numbers of our group of travel
                    agents, and we could put them in direct touch. And we had absolutely no problem.
                    The State Department never quite understood this. But anyway, that was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>Now, the problem with the State Department. Right in the middle of all this, when
                    it's getting down to like two days before the rockets are going to start going
                    up in the air, our defense attach� announced that a special plane was coming in
                    to make deliveries and that the military wives, the dependents, were going to be
                    leaving on it. The ambassador went ballistic, so to speak, saying, “You can't do
                    this. If you go, the whole embassy has to go. You're not separate. You can't
                    just call a plane in to take away your dependents, and we are not evacuating
                    this post.” It went back and forth. They backed down, but the plane did come in
                    at the last moment, and while it was in the air we were told that there would be
                    100 or so seats on it for people who wanted to leave. Consular Affairs went a
                    bit ballistic. All this was being done by the ambassador and the defense
                    attach�s. We only found out about it in the Consular Section quite late, as the
                    consular section up in Jerusalem found out about it quite late. When I told CA
                    about it, they said no one from the embassy should get on the plane unless there
                    was a public announcement to allow American civilians from Israel to get on the
                    plane. Well, as I told them, the airport was opened; planes were flying
                    routinely; any American who wanted to fly out of Israel could go, get a ticket
                    (and there were seats available on every flight), and leave Israel. It went back
                    and forth, back and forth. The end result was that I think some of the American
                    military dependents did go. A number of dependents from Jerusalem went, even
                    though they were never in the problem, although they didn't know that at the
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p> else was happening? Oh, this was when we finally had to do a sort of ordered
                    departure of all dependents from the embassy, and they were sent down to the Red
                    Sea area, to Elat to spend some time in a hotel. And eventually most of them
                    left there and went back to the United States or to other places to sit out the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, one of the problems... I've interviewed
                        both Bill Brown and Chas Freeman, who was ambassador to Saudi Arabia. You
                        had this very peculiar situation where we wanted to keep Israel out of the
                        war and keep Saudi Arabia in. Particularly in Saudi Arabia, it was
                        absolutely essential that we not evacuate the American civilians, because
                        they were essentially running the oil companies and you couldn't have done
                        the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You could not have done the war. You would have impacted on American
                    oil prices back here because nobody knew how long the thing was going to
                    take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I mean at the time, the oil was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: - the reason for the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: - and the planes were being fueled by Saudi oil. So you
                        had this peculiar thing where you really didn't want to evacuate, tell all
                        the Americans to get the hell out, and so anything we did anywhere in the
                        neighborhood would impact and scare the people in Saudi Arabia, who were
                        essentially at more risk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: My understanding was that the oil companies and the American companies
                    in Saudi tied their evacuation policy to whatever the evacuation policy of the
                    embassy was. Therefore, if American civilians were evacuated from the embassy,
                    then the oil workers would also have to go with their families. That was sort of
                    a trip-wire.</p>
                <p>Q: And so you had essentially sitting there, in a way, using Americans - the term
                    isn't quite right - as hostage to the political situation. But it was a very
                    serious one. Were you aware of this dynamic where you were?</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, a little bit, yes. But you know, things were also happening fairly
                    quickly, and as it turned out... Well, what I did, I don't trust the Department
                    of State. I haven't for many, many years. I don't trust the Department of State
                    to protect me. I had my mother with me. She was an invalid. She was also quite
                    old. She also needed help. What I did, I had had a personal friend who was
                    visiting and her vacation was over. She was going back to the States. So about a
                    week before anything happened, I told my mother that I was buying her a ticket
                    and that I wanted her to go back to the States for a month or two. I wasn't
                    going to sit around and wait for our front office or the Secretary of State to
                    make a decision about American dependents when I knew there were so many other
                    factors in play. And I simply sent my invalid mother back to the United States
                    on my own. Any American officer who whines about evacuation policy can do that
                    with his or her family. We can afford plane tickets. We can send our own
                    families anywhere we want to. We don't have to wait for somebody in the
                    Personnel Office at State or a deputy assistant secretary to finally make a
                    decision. We can make our own decisions, and I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As one looks at these things, always after a war, the
                        claims are always much greater than the accomplishments, but what was the
                        sort of the feeling around with American troops coming to Israel, with the
                        Patriot missiles, at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were highly welcomed by the Israelis. They were f�ted, in the
                    sense of 'given feasts.' Israelis gave them gifts, visited them, invited them
                    out to their homes. It was great. I made a number of new friends at the time,
                    too, because there were several retired American Israelis living there who
                    decided it was time to be nice to the people in the embassy and called up to see
                    if they could invite us for dinners. And I went, and I had a great time. Of
                    course, I was out almost every night during this time. It was great, some of the
                    best parties I'd been to. Wars are good for that. Adrenaline runs.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you involved at all in the distribution of gas masks and that sort of
                    thing?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, it wasn't a consular function; it was an admin function, to people
                    in the embassy. But we did not provide gas masks to anybody who was not an
                    official American or an official American dependent because the Israeli
                    Government provided them to everyone in the country - except not on the West
                    Bank.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the regular work and all, a Consular Section always

                        People talk, you know, getting visas or having problems, and say, “Oh, yes,
                        did you hear that?” Did you find that information coming through the
                        Consular Section... how was it received, say, by the Political and minorly
                        the Economic Section?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In general, unfortunately it was fairly typical in the embassy in Tel
                    Aviv, as it is in many embassies, where political sections and economic sections
                    are not interested in consular sections or in anything they can provide or do.
                    Our DCM was interested. I did long series of reports on visiting Arabs, doing
                    this, doing that, various groups that I'd been involved with, some of my
                    ultra-orthodox contacts, and he encouraged me to write as much as possible. He
                    himself rarely went out, so he didn't have the contacts in the society. I
                    encouraged the officers to write, but what happened there is what usually
                    happens, that consular officers say, “I'm too busy. If I write this reporting
                    telegram, I will never get the 25 visa telegrams out.” On the other hand, did we
                    get the interesting stories? It was too much of a mill in many ways. We had the
                    interesting American Israeli stories. We certainly had access to anything in the
                    country, but it wasn't quite the same as when I had been, for example, in Tabriz
                    or in Teheran in the Consular Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your dealing with the Israeli Government,
                        particularly on the, I guess, Ministry of the Interior and the military,
                        with people who were in trouble and all that? What was your -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: As individuals, Israeli officials could be fine. They also lie a lot.
                    They will look you straight in the face and lie about whether or not they have
                    an American in custody. I had one Israeli official who complained about me,
                    lied, made a direct complaint to the ambassador. All I could say was, “He was
                    lying.” But that was that. Israeli officials are no better or worse than any
                    other officials. I had good relations with individual police officials and
                    individual army officials, very good relations. It was my good relations with
                    one Israeli military official that got us access, for the first time in the
                    history of the Intifada, to one of the major detention centers. They hadn't been
                    letting anyone at all visit a particular detention center, called Ansar 2, and I
                    met an Israeli at a party, had a great time with him, and he invited me to come
                    and visit him where he worked, and that's when I discovered he was the deputy
                    commander of... all I can say, it was a major concentration camp. I told him I'd
                    been trying to visit there for months and that his government had always refused
                    to allow it. He said, “Call me tomorrow, and I'll arrange it.” I did, and he
                    did, and two or three days later, I was visiting American prisoners in a prison
                    that we had never been allowed access to and no foreigner had ever been to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on this American prisoner thing, I mean, sort of the
                        creed of a consular officer of any country, but especially an American
                        consular officer, you have to see American prisoners who are in jail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, all that has changed. Consular Affairs no longer does that, as far
                    as I can see. But at the time, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>Q: But you did find yourself... I mean, if you couldn't see an American, you knew
                    an American was in a prison - I don't want to overemphasize this point, but I
                    think it's an important one - you didn't feel that back in Washington or the
                    embassy itself, but I mean basically pressure from Washington was not pulling
                    out all stops to make sure that you were able to fulfill your consular functions
                    and your treaty functions?</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. That's putting it very diplomatically. Visiting
                    prisoners for me is a personal thing. It's one of the things that I consider the
                    most important of the consular functions. It was personal for me because I had
                    spent so long in prison. I get incensed when I cannot get to Americans who are
                    under my jurisdiction, part of my responsibility, and are in prisons in my area.
                    When I arrived in Tel Aviv, I discovered that the prison visit program had
                    largely been dropped. I don't know why, but my predecessor and the officer
                    responsible for American citizens' services had decided it wasn't so important.
                    They had stopped making visits, and they claimed it was an economy measure, to
                    save money. I looked at the woman officer and said, “How does it save money not
                    to visit prisoners?” She couldn't reply. She said, “Oh, it's an economy
                    measure.” I immediately had a total review done of all the prisoner files that
                    we had and announced that effective immediately we would see every prisoner once
                    a month. These in large part were political prisoners, and we were dealing with
                    an Israeli system which tortured prisoners under interrogation and for
                    punishment. You do not drop a prison visit program at a time like that. I put
                    this into effect, and by and large we did it. I went myself on many of the
                    prison visits because I wanted to show the Israelis how important I considered
                    it, that I wasn't just going to send a junior vice-consul on his or her first
                    tour, that the Consul General goes - the same guy whose picture is in the
                    newspaper meeting with the grand rabbi or the chief rabbi of Jerusalem is also
                    tomorrow morning at this prison meeting with an American Palestinian teenager or
                    an American Jewish teenager who's in prison. And over the course of time, we did
                    manage to get a good working relationship with the police, with the military who
                    are responsible for running the prisons on the West Bank and also martial law
                    prisons in Israel proper. And the relationship worked out. It worked out simply
                    by pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing. Now, did we ever get quick
                    notification from the Israelis that they had taken an American prisoner? No.
                    Invariably, they would wait the two full weeks they thought was their due.
                    During those two weeks they would interrogate. During those two weeks they would
                    punish, and they would use methods that are called torture in most civilized
                    countries. Once the visits started, by and large, mistreatment of prisoners
                    stopped - at least for the American prisoners - and in general, once we had
                    established a relationship with whoever was the warden of the time at a
                    particular prison, it worked out okay. We could simply call him up, make
                    arrangements to go. They were quite flexible about times. We would go, have
                    coffee with the warden or have breakfast or something, be given privacy to see
                    the prisoners, and they understood this concept. I'm sure we were being listened
                    to because we were in standard waiting rooms and things like that, but still,
                    given at least superficial privacy. We were allowed to receive letters, to take
                    letters from the prisoners. We were allowed to give them letters. We were
                    allowed to give them things like clothing, vitamins, anything else that their
                    families would send. And it worked out. In fact, I could go on and on about
                    visiting prisons there, because I probably made 40 to 50, at least, prison
                    visits. I was doing this every other month myself - not every prison visit,
                    because it's something also that FSNs do, it's something that junior officers
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sure. I mean, this is part of their experience,
                        training.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>METRINKO: But it got to the point, when I was leaving Israel, the prison camp
                    Ansar 2, where we had had so much trouble getting in... And I have to tell you
                    the story about Bill Brown � propos of that. My last visit there, the warden had
                    become a friend. The deputy warden was a friend. I would see him socially with
                    his wife back in Tel Aviv. On my last visit there - they knew it was my last
                    visit - I had one prisoner there who still had several months to go on his
                    sentence - and I arrived at the prison, went in, as always, you know, to sit and
                    chat with the warden for a while, and he said he had a few gifts for me in honor
                    of my last visit to the prisons since I was going back to America, and he gave
                    me a little metal container to hold visiting cards, and it had the name of the
                    prison and the date on it, and that was nice. And he said, “After you see
                    Mohammed, the staff would like to have you come to lunch to our cafeteria.”
                    Fine, thank you, I'd like to. He said, “Oh, and as a the real gift that we want
                    to give you in honor of your last visit, we're giving you your prisoner.” What
                    do you mean? He said, “You can take him with you today. We're going to set him
                    free, but you have to take him.” And I said, “You can do this?” He said, “Yes, I
                    can.” And he said, “We decided it was the most appropriate gift.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>: Yes, so I went to see Mohammed, who was, like, a 16-year-old American
                    Palestinian from the USA who had come to the West Bank the year before to stay
                    with his grandmother, had gotten caught up in the stone-throwing. I went to see
                    him. They brought him over to me. I used to go right into the barbed wire areas.
                    And I looked at him and said, “We're not going to talk too long. I have some
                    things from your family here,” etc., etc., but basically, “Go back to your cell,
                    say goodbye to your cellmates because you're going with me in about another
                    hour. I'm going to a lunch and I'll be back and pick you up.” He said, “What do
                    you mean? I'm here for another three months.” And I got him, just took him out.
                    I signed the papers, the “receipt” for him and everything else, and came out
                    with him. My FSN thought this was great. She was a wonderful lady. I got to the
                    driver, who had not been part of any of this, because the driver was not allowed
                    in with the embassy car, and we told him we were going to the West Bank, to a
                    particular town, to take this boy home. And he said, “How do you get there? I've
                    never been to the West Bank.” I said, “Well, don't you have a map?” He said no.
                    I turned to the kid, and I said, “You know how to get there don't you?” He said,
                    “No, I've never been in this part. They brought me all the way from home in a
                    van with no windows. I've never seen this part of Israel or the West Bank.” But
                    we found it. We got up there, and it was great. It took us a couple of hours to
                    get to his house, of course, which was at the far end of the country, but we
                    drove there in a couple of hours, got him there, and drove him through
                    Jerusalem. He got to see Jerusalem for the first time in his life, got him up to
                    his home. We parked the car outside. There was absolutely nobody. It was a
                    pleasant enough looking village, but nobody around. We said, “Go inside and tell
                    your family you're here. We'll wait until you're inside, and then we'll say
                    goodbye after you come out again.” He went inside the house, and about three
                    minutes later there was an explosion of people running out, and it ended up with
                    a big festival in the house and everything else and dinner and the whole
                    bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a good gift. Israelis could do that. They could be that
                    charming, that sensitive, that intelligent. They could also be total bastards
                    who didn't give a damn who they killed or tortured. They'd go flip-flopping back
                    and forth. Cultured, intelligent, educated, well-traveled - you know, nice
                    families, the soul of civilization, and they turn around and they will kill
                    somebody in cold blood, and they don't seem to care. This is why I was never
                    comfortable in the country. And then they'd threaten you if you protested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were going to say something about -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, Bill Brown. In one of my prison visits I had come back, and I
                    had written a fairly long report because I was really the first foreign diplomat
                    who was getting into some of these places. And in the report on Ansar I had
                    talked about how the camp was divided and how in one barbed-wire pen, open to
                    the elements... The pens were large barbed-wire fenced areas about the size of a
                    basketball court, for example, just barbed wire, and you might have some canvas
                    over the top or a tent in the middle, but basically prisoners sat outside, sun,
                    rain, snow sometimes. And I was passing one pen by with the guard who was
                    escorting me to my meeting with the warden, I looked at it and it was filled
                    with children. And I looked at it and I said, “Who are they?” And he said, “Oh,
                    those are the ones who are under age.” It was a barbed-wire pen filled with
                    young kids, Palestinians, who were in prison. Well, I put this in the report.
                    The ambassador came down. I was eating lunch in the cafeteria the next day, and
                    the ambassador came down and he saw me and he walked over, and he said, “Mind if
                    I sit down?” Sure. He said, “You know, I saw that report about the kids in the
                    pen, and I talked to some of my Israeli friends in the government about it, and
                    you know, Michael, that's done to protect these kids because their lives are so
                    bad at home and they have such terrible living conditions. This is really the
                    way they get trained. This is best for them.” I just looked at him and said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, they were children in prison in a barbed-wire pen.” And he
                    finally just got up and left. He really believed that this was appropriate. That
                    was the mindset I'm talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, what was your feeling about... Did you have
                        any relations, particularly on prisoners and all and treatment thereof, with
                        the CIA people at our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, the CIA people there were basically not interested in anything
                    going on in prisons. Decent social relations, entertainment, etc., go to their
                    homes for dinner and they would come to mine. To the best of my knowledge, we
                    had no one from the Agency working in the consular section, at least no one that
                    I knew of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you left there in '93.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I left there in '93, having survived two ambassadors and a couple of
                    charg�s. I should say, by the way, that our second ambassador, Bill Harrop, who
                    was assigned to Israel, was perhaps the best person for whom I have ever worked
                    - incredibly professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course he was kicked out of there by -</hi>

                <p>Q: - by the Jewish lobby, yes. Of course he was.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: But incredibly professional, sensitive, intelligent. But, anyway... And
                    a nice man. I left there and came back to the States with an assignment to
                    Population, Refugees, and Migration - PRM - in the Refugee Bureau, where I was
                    the office director for what they called ENSA, Europe, Near East, and South
                    Asia. I was the office director for an area filled with hot spots. I had all of
                    Europe, so we had Yugoslavia and a civil war, or whatever kind of war you want
                    to call it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from '93 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: '93 to '96, a three-year assignment. I had the collapsing Soviet Union
                    and a whole variety of flashpoints there, everything from, good Lord... I mean,
                    the whole Soviet Union was just -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you had Georgia and you had Azerbaijan and
                        Armenia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Chechnya - I had that. I had the remnants of the Afghan situation. I
                    had a civil war in Yemen. That was sort of brief, but I also had the
                    Palestinians and the Jewish Agency. And a major part of our budget, or a huge
                    chunk of my budget, which was about $350 million per year for refugee work in my
                    area, went to the Jewish Agency to support Jewish refugees going to Israel, of
                    which there are none (not by any standard definition of refugee, anyway), and
                    also the Palestinians in the camps. This was at a time, '93, when everybody had
                    decided it would be in our interests, because of Oslo, if we could -</p>

                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Everyone had decided, or at least the State Department and the White
                    House had decided it would behoove us to start throwing larger amounts of money
                    at the Palestinians to make it seem that we were doing something to make their
                    lives better. The State Department, through the Refugee Bureau, had been
                    supporting UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine
                    refugees ever since it was founded and had been the major donor throughout that
                    time for UNRWA. This means that we were the ones providing a major percentage of
                    all the money spent on Palestinian refugees by the United Nations. But both of
                    those portfolios also were handed to me. And a decision sort of had been made in
                    State that AID would take care of doing things for Gaza and the West Bank and
                    that Refugee Bureau money would go to Palestinians in Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria
                    - which was fine. It meant that I had a lot of travel to those areas and
                    traveled to other parts, too. I got to Serbia; I got to Croatia; I got to
                    Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen; and also many times to Jordan and Syria, the
                    West Bank and Gaza, Israel itself, and even into Lebanon once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the whole Palestinian thing. What
                        was your impression of this '93-96 period about what was happening,
                        effectiveness, non-effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had a problem dealing with the Palestinians, as we do dealing with
                    Israel. There are no American political leaders who have the balls to speak
                    frankly or the truth to either the Palestinians or the Israelis. The
                    Palestinians - I'm going to use harsh terms now - have been whining about being
                    refugees since 1947. Most of them are not refugees. All of the Palestinians who
                    went to Jordan, for example, which is the bulk of Palestinians, a couple of
                    million, were given full citizenship status by the Government of Jordan back in
                    the early 1950s. They are citizens of Jordan. They do military service; they pay
                    taxes; they carry Jordanian passports. The present king of Jordan is married to
                    a Palestinian wife. They are fully involved in Jordanian society, and they are
                    some of the richest people in Jordan.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>They're up and down throughout the government, every part of the government. And
                    yet when they want to, they continue claim refugee status. This is bullshit. And
                    a couple of times we made - not we in the sense of me, but various
                    administrations in the United States made - feeble attempts to sort of wipe the
                    Jordanian Palestinians off the refugee rolls. The United Nations is trying to do
                    this off and on, too. The Government of Jordan always said, “Please don't do it
                    because if they get told they're no longer refugees, then they will have an
                    uprising here and our government will have trouble.” So for Jordanian internal
                    political reasons we still consider the Palestinians in Jordan refugees. They
                    are not. That's like total bullshit. The ones in Syria have full legal status
                    except that they are not citizens. Fine. I guess, in theory, you could consider
                    them refugees, but it's been three generations. That's a bit long to be a
                    refugee. The ones in Lebanon are treated generally despicably by the Lebanese
                    Government. Lebanese Governments are best known for their cupidity and
                    corruption. They have been awful dealing with Palestinians. Early, early on the
                    Christian parts of the Lebanese Government got the Christian Palestinians
                    declared full citizens. They were given Lebanese citizenship back in the late
                    '40s, early '50s. So the Christian Palestinians there are fine. They are full
                    Lebanese citizens and vote - if anyone votes in Lebanon. I guess they get paid
                    for their votes in Lebanon. Am I a bit acidic about the Middle East? But it's
                    all those 16 or 17 years of living there. The Muslim Palestinians have been
                    treated very, very harshly by everybody - by the Lebanese Government, by other
                    Lebanese groups, by Syria, by the Israelis, by the United States. Every time
                    they would stick their heads up and try and get some dignity, we'd call them
                    terrorists and smash them down again. Or we let Israel go in and smash them down
                    again. They are treated very poorly. Yes, they would qualify as refugees because
                    they have never been accepted in Lebanon. Syria, not really, not any more.
                    Jordan, not for a long time. The question used to come up of the Palestinians
                    living in Gaza and the West Bank, areas under Palestinian control. If you have a
                    Palestinian travel document, or if you have a Palestinian passport, are you
                    still a refugee if you're living in a Palestinian area? Well, the legal answer
                    would be no, and yet we've allowed the Palestinians for a long time to continue
                    claiming this. For many it's because they're on the dole. They get education;
                    they get medication; they get other things courtesy of the United Nations. It's
                    a free ride.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel while you were doing this that you were basically handing out a
                    dole or involved in a -</p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was done for political reasons, but I had great fun. I was given
                    many, many millions of dollars. I was the only one in the refugee... I mean,
                    this was my bailiwick, the Refugee Bureau, and I was told to select projects
                    that would be public, look good, make the United States look good, and make it
                    seem for the Palestinians as though there is movement and that they had not been
                    forgotten by the world or by Arafat, who had indeed forgotten them. “We're
                    building you a school. Now shut up!” - basically. “We're putting up this clinic.
                    Now stop making noise.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the situation there, but when you go look at it, one
                        almost gets a feeling of a terribly squalid situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It depends. You know, the camps in Syria and Jordan are no worse than
                    the Syrian and Jordan towns. I mean they're part of the towns. You really can't
                    tell in most case when you're in the camp and when you're in a normal town. And
                    the squalor is often the irresponsibility of the people living there. If someone
                    doesn't clean the street, it doesn't matter if you're a refugee or a
                    multimillionaire. It looks squalid. A lot of it is the “give me” mentality of
                    the Middle East, just as in Israel. Give me, give me, give me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the Yugoslav thing, what about central
                        Asia and the Soviet Union? What were we doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Logically we had some rather ridiculous programs in the former Soviet
                    Union. And we had some very ridiculous programs in the former Yugoslavia. What
                    were we doing in the former Soviet Union? We were helping in Azerbaijan. We were
                    helping in the Armenian areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were feeding the heavy hand of the Armenian lobby, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You couldn't give direct aid to the Azerbaijani Government or
                    Azerbaijani organizations. You had to work with third parties, but you know,
                    what we were doing, a lot of it was very basic stuff like supporting women,
                    businesses, supporting doles of food. A lot of it was absurd, but we were
                    supporting programs, for example, these mom-and-pop-type minor business
                    enterprises in Russia proper. And I remember I used to bring this up at
                    meetings. Every time we would get a proposal in, we were expected to give a
                    certain amount of money. We couldn't just stop giving money. And I would say
                    things like, “You know, Russia has billions of dollars worth of art that it has
                    locked up in various basements. If they would just sell a painting, they could
                    provide food for this area for the next ten years. Why are we giving them
                    American taxpayer money for something that the Russian central government should
                    handle?” I'm conservative fiscally. But we just continued to give. The refugee
                    business is a business. There are a lot of organizations in Washington, in the
                    United States, and internationally that exist sort of as businesses.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: And you have to have refugees. And if you can't find an active refugee
                    who's running with a pack on her back from a burning town, then find somebody
                    who's been there for the last 20 years but was wretched and is willing to take
                    your money.</p>

                        these were beginning to move into economic refugees - the NGO organizations
                        would go howling because this was taking away their numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You take away the numbers of refugees and you take away the budget from

                        a ton of bricks about this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yugoslavia - everybody in the world was dealing with Yugoslavia. I had
                    an officer whose only job was to deal with Yugoslavia, or the remnants of
                    Yugoslavia. He had served there at one point, so he knew quite a bit about
                    Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was complicated. If you wanted to deal with Yugoslavia
                    you could spend all day long going to meetings about Yugoslavia, all day, from
                    early morning till late at night, incessant talking points, incessant
                    preparation for this meeting, for that meeting, sort of total inability of the
                    people at the time in the State Department to understand what was happening
                    there. The head of PRM at that point was Warren Zimmerman, who had just come out
                    of Belgrade as ambassador. He was upset with American policy. I have to confess
                    I was never quite sure what American policy was because you had the State
                    Department and you had the military and you had Congress and you had so many
                    refugee groups in there and other groups in there that it was just a constant
                    circus of policies. It was just a bit strange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this result in your office doing much for people who

                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, I guess we helped a lot of individuals to get over some bad times
                    in their lives, and yes, if you were being thrown out of your town because you
                    happened to be Catholic in the wrong place or Orthodox in the wrong place or
                    Muslim in the wrong place, and you got to a camp, yes, we would get you food and
                    teddy bears and good clothing and this and that, and maybe some job training,
                    education - the kids would stay on in school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the NGO's that you were

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Hmm, basically, it was all sort of like Peace Corps with a salary. They
                    were interesting people. I met a lot of them I liked. I thought some of them
                    were into semi-scans. I'll give you one story. I went to Yemen right at the end
                    of the civil war. We had set aside about a million dollars for Yemen because the
                    International Red Cross claimed that it was necessary for programming there. I
                    got to Yemen, and- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I got to Yemen. I paid a call on the Red Cross, of course, in their nice office -
                    and they had a very nice office and a large staff, and they gave me a full
                    briefing of everything they were doing there. And then I went to see the head of
                    the Yemeni Red Crescent, the equivalent of the Red Cross, who gave me a totally
                    different story about the Red Cross. It was eye-opening for me. What he said was
                    this. He said, “You know, you just gave the International Red Cross a million
                    dollars for Yemen. That's very interesting because didn't know that they had
                    requested it, nor do I know or anyone on my staff what they want to use it for.
                    They arrived here in the middle of the civil war” - it was a short civil war,
                    only six weeks - “and we had already lost all of our ambulances; our offices in
                    Aden and other places had been destroyed; we had lost staff; our offices had
                    been looted; and we had basically no resources at all. They arrived here and
                    spent the next few weeks looking for villas for each and every one of the Red
                    Cross staff who was going to come here. They got large private homes. They went
                    looking for office space, and they got a large beautiful office. Then they
                    started bringing in cars for themselves. Now they all have their cars. I'm not
                    quite sure what they're doing, other than really providing themselves a very
                    nice place to live and work. They really haven't been out in the countryside
                    much, nor do they ever consult with us.”</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>Yes, there's a lot of that. In Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, if you went to
                    any good restaurant or any good hotel, it looked like an NGO parking lot. You
                    could see a fleet of SUVs (sport utility vehicles) or RVs (recreation vehicles -
                    the sort of big things, Ford Explorer type things) with lots of big antennas and
                    lots of bright glistening colors and everything else. They were the vehicles
                    brought in by the NGOs. Do NGOs fill a role? Yes, absolutely. Do all of them?
                    No, some of them are worthless, and some of them are basically dewy eyed people
                    who want to teach other people how to cut paper dolls and do embroidery,
                    programs that I have laughed at when they have come to us for funding and that
                    somehow were funded. A group from Washington received money to go to Mexico to
                    study the causes of Mexican migration, out of Mexico into the United States.
                    When this was proposed, I looked around the table, and I said, “We're going to
                    spend money to send people to Mexico for this? People come out of Mexico because
                    it's overpopulated and they have no jobs. They can get jobs with American dollar
                    salaries up here easily. That's why they come here.” You don't need to send a
                    research team down there. The research team people, by the way, were getting
                    paid $400 a day, and I said to the table, “All of you here, despite your ranks,
                    there's not one of you earning $400 a day. Do you think a graduate student
                    should be getting that for going to Mexico to tell us the country is
                    overpopulated?” It was still approved.</p>
                <p> remember in one Palestinian camp I had met a very, very bright woman, an
                    absolutely superb Palestinian woman. We were talking about projects for the
                    camp. We were talking about a school, specifically, and other projects, and she
                    said, “Look, we're tired of people who come here and want to set up programs to
                    teach us embroidery. We don't want to do any more embroidery. Can you get us a
                    computer education class?” That's what I did. But you have lots of people in the
                    international organizations who want to teach the widows and the wives of the
                    refugees how to do embroidery and handicrafts, as if they're going to be able to
                    do something with this. It's absurd. And you see this all over any area where
                    there are refugee problems. There are real refugee problems. There were huge
                    problems in Africa, which got comparatively little publicity because reporters
                    don't like to go there. And there are miserable problems there - thousands and
                    thousands of people getting slaughtered and killed. The American response to
                    refugee problems has, in general, been very good. Doctors pick up their satchels
                    and go off and do medical care, and this happens, and that happens, and people
                    volunteer. Fire companies go over to fight fires. It goes on like that. There's
                    also a tremendous amount of waste.</p>
                <p>I have a friend whose job when he worked for an NGO was to take all of the
                    incoming shipments of clothing from the United States, unopened - I mean don't
                    open them, simply take them down to the beach somewhere in Croatia - and burn
                    them on the beach because nobody wanted any more used American clothing, and
                    they weren't going to spend the time and the trouble to unpack all these bales
                    and figure out if it was worthwhile. So they would simply receive it and burn
                    it.</p>

                        in southern Italy where I was consul general. People were sending these
                        clothes, including evening dresses and all this, and they would just put
                        them in a pile, and people would come and take what they wanted, if
                        anything, but basically people in Europe are well dressed and -</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that wasn't the problem. They were thinking in World
                        War II terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Chocolate bars and nylon stockings. I remember in the camps I would go
                    into, barracks had been set up, and the one thing that there was no shortage of
                    was teddy bears and stuffed animals. You could go into these little rooms and
                    you would see 50 stuffed animals pinned to the walls because every schoolchild
                    in America had sent his teddy bear or a little stuffed rabbit. Anyway - but in
                    general, the bureau was a very good bureau because it did very good work, it was
                    in general well run. There were a lot of people in the bureau who were very
                    good. There were some who were not. It was overstaffed by civil servants and was
                    suffering for that, because they had been there for too long doing their job,
                    and it had become sacerdotal as opposed to functionary. They thought of
                    themselves as the high priests and priestesses dispensing largesse. You can't
                    have a civil servant doling out money for 10 or 15 years and not have it go to
                    his or her head. They became totally basically obnoxious about it. The bureau
                    still suffers from that. But then again, it was still all in all a very good
                    bureau.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I had a problem. I retired. Not a problem... I did not cross the

                        Just from your account here, you obviously had not been a “team

                </p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No - a team player, but not a sheep. If I saw a problem, I would say,
                    “I think this is a problem.” I had a serious problem in PRM because of my
                    refusal to sign off on a grant to the Jewish Agency. The annual $60
                    million-giveaway to people who are immigrating to Israel, which we gave as
                    “refugee assistance.” The inspector general had done an inspection of the
                    Palestinian programs and the Jewish Agency programs that we had. They started
                    the inspection about a month after I came to the office. The inspection lasted
                    almost a year, off and on, before the final reports were in and everything else.
                    They were highly critical of the types of things that we were supporting in
                    Israel, the Jewish Agency. It said they were not refugee-related. I took this to
                    heart because I agreed with them. I got into a lot of trouble with it.
                    Basically, the idea in the bureau was to take the inspector general's report and
                    stuff into the back of a very dark, lost file cabinet. The head of the
                    inspection team was threatened by the Jewish lobby. He happened to be Jewish.
                    His rabbi contacted him and asked him how he could possibly be doing what he was
                    doing with this inspection report. I was threatened by the Jewish lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, in what manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Because I was questioning the monies that were being spent with the
                    Jewish Agency through the United Israel Appeal. We used to go up to the United
                    Israel Appeal up in New York City. We had meetings there, and they would come
                    down to see us and to discuss the programs that they could and could not do with
                    this money. I had a call about two and a half years into the job from a close
                    friend from Israel. I don't want to describe him because I don't want him to get
                    into trouble, but a close friend, a rabbi in Israel who had just been in a
                    closed-door meeting with a group of what they called “Jewish philanthropists.”
                    And he told me that the head of the United Israel Appeal, Shoshana Cardin, an
                    American, very much a society type, you know, high living in New York City, had
                    looked around the meeting room and said that there was an anti-Semite in the
                    State Department who was giving them money trouble and efforts had to be made,
                    something had to be done to silence him or get him out of the State Department.
                    Period. She used my name, said I was the person. He called me when he got out of
                    the meeting, and he said, “Michael, this isn't you. I know who you are. I've
                    been working with you and we've been friends for years. What's going on?” And I
                    told him about the Jewish Agency budget and what I'd been doing. And he said,
                    “They're going to get you.” He said, “You're right. You're absolutely right. It
                    is a scam, but everyone goes along with it. Why can't you?” I said, “No.” That
                    was that.</p>
                <p>Now, when I heard that, I went over to the Assistant Secretary, told her what had
                    happened, and said that it would probably not be in the interests of the office
                    or the bureau if I continued to deal with this portfolio, but I would do
                    whatever she wanted. And we had a short -</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Phyllis Oakley. And Phyllis was the ultimate team player on her own
                    team. I was never quite sure what her team was. Her response was to go up to the
                    United Israel Appeal dinner about a month later and to receive a personal award
                    for herself, which she hung on the office wall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In 1996 I received a letter saying, “You have not gone over the
                    threshold.” I'm not sure, because I never bothered looking at the statistics, to
                    what extent this was a result of the decision to give positions and preference
                    to so many hundreds of women, who'd had a lawsuit against the Department. I
                    don't really care. I was 49 � years old. I had been in the federal government
                    for 29 � years, just about 30 years of service. I was tired of it at the time. I
                    was told I was basically out of the Foreign Service with a full pension, which
                    is fine.</p>
                <p>

                        what have you been doing since?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I've been working constantly since the day I left the Foreign Service.
                    I had a job for a year and a half working with a company building a website on
                    the Internet dealing with stock exchanges overseas. I found it fascinating and
                    learned a hell of a lot about computers and the financial world. I went from
                    there (because they were moving to New Jersey - they have since disappeared, by
                    the way; they were one of the Internet companies that simply disappeared) to a
                    private contractor that contracted me to the Immigration and Naturalization
                    Service, where I was a project director for a year and a half. I left INS
                    because I could no longer... well, two reasons. The general incompetence of the
                    organization was so abysmal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a real problem. I was a liaison officer there some
                        years earlier, and they've got a real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They have. The head of the section, when I started to work there told
                    me that “Production is not a value at INS.” And I saw things there that... I
                    don't want to start. INS is abysmally bad, and no one cared. INS is just an
                    organization with incredible problems. I lasted a year and a half. My mother got
                    very, very ill. I left INS. I had been asked by the State Department to come
                    back as an annuitant at this point. I had agreed to this. My mother became even
                    more ill at this point, and died about two months later. So I worked with the
                    Department as a Desk officer for the Eastern Caribbean for six months, until
                    June of this year, 2000, the 26th. I'm still on the rolls as an annuitant. On
                    June 26th I took off and went on an 11,000-mile trip around the United States.
                    I'd just gotten back a couple of days ago from the last part of my trip, and I
                    will continue to travel until I go back to work again. I do not know yet where
                    or when I will go back to work. I'm only not quite 54, so I intend working about
                    another 10 to 15 years.</p>

                        with Michael Metrinko and this is an addendum to the one which we did
                        because after we did the first oral history he got himself off to
                        Afghanistan. This is being done on behalf of the Association of Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, Mike, can you
                        sort of pick up what happened to you and we'll move on to Afghanistan? What

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, we have to go back to the year, let's see now, this is 2003, to
                    the year 2001 when I received a phone call from the State Department asking me
                    if I would be interested to going to Yemen briefly.</p>

                <p>: Before 9/11. To take over the office in Aden that had been set up by the
                    Department of State and by the embassy in Sanaa, Yemen to handle the
                    investigation into the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole. I was asked to do this and I
                    left in March in the year 2001. I was there for three months. I worked over
                    there for three months. I was not in charge of the investigation. That was being
                    done by the FBI, but I was in charge of the office that gave all the support for
                    the investigators.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about this. Could you explain, what
                        caused, what was the U.S.S. Cole situation and what were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The U.S.S. Cole was a naval ship that came into the harbor in Aden,
                    Yemen in late 2001 and was attacked by I'm not going to use the word terrorists,
                    because even the U.S. navy does not say it was an act of terrorism. It was
                    attacked by people who had explosives in a small boat, which pulled up alongside
                    the navy ship and blew up. It caused a large number of deaths. It caused a
                    larger number of injured and the immediate reaction in the United States was
                    panic followed by a huge outpouring of FBI and CIA, but mainly FBI and also U.S.
                    marines into the city of Aden which is down on the southern coast of Yemen. They
                    did not know the extent of the original incident and they got there while the
                    boat was still in the harbor and it looked like it might be about to sink. This
                    was in December of the year 2000. I arrived there in March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, what were you impressions of
                        Yemen at that time? What you were seeing was Aden and how the people from
                        Yemen worked and didn't work with our people. I mean, you throw a lot of
                        investigators in and you've got problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened in Yemen and specifically in Aden during that
                    investigation was a huge clash of cultures. By that let's say we had three
                    different cultures. One was the culture of the Yemenis themselves who at first
                    did not want to admit that there had been any Yemeni involvement or that this
                    was a problem. Specifically the authorities down in Aden who did not want either
                    interference in the capital in Sanaa and certainly did not want a large group of
                    foreigners rushing in trying to do an investigation. Aden is a very
                    conservative, somewhat laid back, but extremely city. The second culture was the
                    FBI macho we're here to get this all straightened up right now culture combined
                    with the U.S. marines who rushed in in full force and acted at the very
                    beginning from what I've been told almost like they were attacking Aden rather
                    than coming to do an investigation. Of course they were coming at a time when
                    nobody knew exactly what had happened and they didn't know if they were going to
                    be met by violence or an arms struggle. So, when they actually arrived in the
                    airport without permission from anybody as far as I know, anybody in the Yemeni
                    government, they arrived in full attack mode. The third culture was the State
                    Department culture. The State Department culture which recognized that there was
                    a serious problem of course, but also, did not want to destroy its relationship
                    with the government of Yemen by letting the FBI take full charge of the
                    investigation in that part of the country or the way we dealt with Yemeni
                    officials.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Our ambassador in Yemen at the time was Barbara Bodine, a professional
                    career diplomat, who spoke good Arabic and had been ambassador there for at
                    least a year by this point, I think more. More like two or three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yemen, also, at one point there had been a south Yemen,
                        hadn't there? I mean, which had been very close to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a Marxist republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Marxist republic so that added to, I mean you had your
                        traditional regime, but you also must have had some prickly Marxists running
                        around, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, Aden was rather a strange city. Aden had been a crown colony of
                    the British government or the British Empire. It was called the pearl of the
                    Orient for a long time and the port of Aden for commercial shipping was number
                    two in the world, second only to New York City up until the British empire
                    started to disintegrate and there was a communist coo, a communist takeover.
                    Aden, the Republic of Aden became staunchly communist and commercial life went
                    to hell. The port basically disappeared into nothingness during that period.
                    Under the British we'd even had an embassy there and the embassy building was
                    still there right on the water, a pleasant old sort of hacienda type building
                    overlooking the harbor. There was a civil war, I'm sorry, there was a
                    unification of the two countries, the Republic of the Yemeni, sorry the Republic
                    of Aden and the country of Yemen itself became one country. Then in the year and
                    I want to say 1995, I could be wrong by the date, but there was a civil war, a
                    civil war which only lasted a few weeks and the country became unified again.
                    Aden was strange. Aden itself was unlike the rest of Yemen. It was on the far
                    side of a very steep mountains. It was coastal and Aden looked out. It looked
                    out towards India. It looked out towards Ethiopia. It looked out towards the Red
                    Sea, the Arabic Sea, the Arabian Sea rather. The people there tended to be a
                    racial mixture of those places. A lot of very visibly Chinese and Indian and
                    Ethiopian blood, Somalian blood in the people. You could see this quite
                    easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, Indian, too because right across the water was India. So, there
                    were Indians living there who had always stayed there. They ran some businesses
                    still. There were some, I'm thinking in the old British consulate there which
                    still existed and which was a throwback to the British Empire. There was an
                    Indian in charge, but a very strange little city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived at sort of what point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I arrived in March of the year 2001. Yes, I'm mixing up my years here.
                    March in the year 2001. I had had two predecessors in my job and our job was as
                    the ambassador said to provide adult supervision to the investigators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now two predecessors in a time of about three
                        months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, but they were there a short time because this was all patched
                    together very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this wasn't because they were kicked out or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just short term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Short term to set up and run an office so that the embassy could have
                    liaison with the whole group down there because the group in Aden was a sort of
                    mish mash of various investigative authorities. We had the FBI in large numbers.
                    We had the marine fast team, the counter terrorism people. We had diplomatic
                    security. We had NCIS, the naval investigators. We had DIA and we had CIA. So,
                    there was a large amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like, talk about a can of worms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A can of armed worms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What did you find when you got there? In the first
                        place, what did the ambassador talk to you, how was the ambassador dealing
                        with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador had had a bad run in with the FBI well prior to my
                    arrival. In fact she had thrown the head of the FBI investigators out of the
                    country. There was a personality conflict and again a conflict in cultures. The
                    FBI thought that they could make demands and sort of carry on a very aggressive
                    investigation without paying too much to Yemeni sensibilities or Yemeni law.
                    They were going all out and aggravating people there constantly, aggravating the
                    Yemenis. On the other hand the Yemeni authorities were recalcitrant. They
                    weren't interested very much in providing information because some of the people
                    who were being investigated were being linked to the Yemeni government. This was
                    a difficult situation. The ambassador felt that the best way to proceed with the
                    investigation was to keep peace between the investigators and the government. In
                    order for the investigation to run smoothly to keep peace between the officials
                    in Yemen, I'm sorry, the officials in Aden with their superiors in Sanaa with
                    the embassy and with the State Department and with the various offices, the CIA,
                    DIA, NCIS, FBI, marines, etc. and with the operation as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate with these disparate groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was an interesting exercise. I was there to help them get their work
                    done in many ways to try and explain local culture or morays to them, also to
                    report to the ambassador, to make sure that they were reporting not the nitty
                    gritty of their investigation because we weren't supposed to know that. I mean
                    their investigation was a secure investigation, but to report the mechanics, the
                    relationships, the way local officials were either being cooperative or
                    non-cooperative. It led a number of cases to the ambassador going in to the
                    president of Yemen or the minister of foreign affairs or the minister of the
                    interior up in Sanaa just to smooth things over or to sort of get the officials
                    in Aden to move more quickly or to move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can't imagine anything worse than putting the CIA,
                        the FBI and the naval investigators all into the small same town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Small town nothing, we were in the same, we lived together, worked
                    together, ate together, exercised together and many of them were locked into the
                    two floors of the hotel that we had rented for our stay there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: With difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, I mean, normally if you're having an
                        investigation you try to have one entity investigate.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Normally, yes, but this was abnormal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the name of Osama Bin Laden thrown out by the time you
                        got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh yes, of course, his name was all over. His family was also building
                    the new airport in Aden and it was the Bin Laden Construction Company signs that
                    we could see whenever we went to the airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I lived in a Bin Laden house in Dhahran back in the '50s,
                        so I mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Of course the Bin Ladens were originally a family from Yemen. They had
                    a lot of family not in that area, but in other parts of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you, you know, I mean these people were running
                        around, what were you coming away with? I realize you weren't in the middle
                        part, you know in the secret part of the investigation, but I mean it must
                        have all been pretty clear what was coming out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What I came away with from Aden was what I also came away with, a
                    lesson from Afghanistan and it's this. We have several agencies in the United
                    States government. By this I include the Department of Defense, we also had
                    Defense Department army attache there, too. We have the Department of Defense;
                    we have investigative agencies or law enforcement agencies, part of the
                    Department of Justice like the FBI. We have the CIA. We have others, the
                    marines, etc. who can be and often are very intelligent, very capable people who
                    know their field quite well, but who don't know a damned thing about other
                    regions of the world. They try to apply their skill and expertise in foreign
                    environments where it simply does not work. It's sort of like cooking at a very
                    high altitude. You may know the recipe, but when you go to a very different
                    altitude, all of the temperatures get skewed and you can make a mess of your
                    cooking. That's what they were often doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in the way of sort of a lecturer
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>METRINKO: A lecturer, but a lecturer to adults and adults don't' like to be
                    lectured at. I also found that many of the people who are sent overseas
                    including by the Department of State were culturally and intellectually
                    incapable of conducting a normal life overseas. They were people who should not
                    have been let out of the United States by any agency. They were either stupid or
                    unwilling to look around and realize they were in a foreign environment. Because
                    of this attitude, sort of caused a great many problems which impacted on the
                    efficiency of the investigation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, can you describe how some of these things went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Sure, one good example. Diplomatic security went all out to hire a huge
                    number of new people to fill lots of vacancies. Someone taught all these brand
                    new people who were straight out of police forces and straight out of the
                    military and straight out of college. The whole concept of defensive, aggressive
                    defensive driving. This is the type of security driving by zigzagging, by having
                    cars going in tandem as opposed to one behind the other. For example, if two
                    U.S. government cars are approaching an intersection or approaching a circle,
                    one hangs off to the side a little bit, not quite fully behind the first car. If
                    the principle person is in the first car, then the second car is going to be
                    slightly off to the back not too far away and they completely fill up any circle
                    that they're trying to go around. They do this at high rates of speed. They roar
                    down streets zigzagging back and forth together at very high rates of speed,
                    sometimes with sirens, sometimes not. Aden was a nice quiet city. This looked
                    stupid, idiotic and incompetent.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, why were they doing this? Did they feel they were targets?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were attracting attention that was actually. Did they feel they
                    were targets? Well, somebody had told them, some guru back in DS training had
                    told them this was the way they were supposed to drive in a high threat
                    environment. I kept trying to explain that it's only high threat if someone is
                    actively after you, but they had their orders. It was one of the most ridiculous
                    things I ever saw. To give you an example of how bad it was, when I say high
                    rates of speed, they would go 50 miles an hour down city streets zigzagging, you
                    know, causing people to jump out of the way, causing other cars to swerve out of
                    the way. We were supposed to be having a dinner once to introduce or to sort of
                    a dinner in honor of the head of security of the city of Aden. He was coming to
                    the hotel and everything was all arranged. Some of our cars had just returned
                    from driving this way in the city. The security chief came in and he was livid
                    and he said, “My men and I were standing on a street corner trying to cross and
                    your two cars” and he used some other words besides two, “sprayed us with gravel
                    when they swerved around the corner. Don't you realize this is stupid? This is
                    not the way to drive in a crowded city?” Our diplomatic security people were
                    unfortunately quite often inept. Many of them were very good. Many of them were
                    inept and there was no way to talk to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you start bringing in people who don't understand the
                        culture and all, I've watched this with the military and with other groups
                        overseas. There's a tendency to get, to lock oneself into a bunker, in other
                        words, to go to the hotel and sit around at night and drink and talk about
                        the rag heads or something like that which makes it even worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Which makes it even worse. There is another problem with security. We
                    had marines for example. I don't want to talk too much about this because it
                    gets into operations, but we had a fast team of marines there who were very
                    bright young guys. I came out of this with a very healthy deep respect for the
                    U.S. Marine Corps, which I'd always had, but this just sort of enforced it. I
                    think I had 16 or 18 marines with an officer in charge. They never left the
                    hotel. There were two different teams there when I was there. They never left
                    the hotel grounds. I shouldn't say never. Very, very rarely. With the first of
                    the marine officers who was in charge when I realized the marines weren't going
                    out at all, now they would go out to the beach. The hotel was on a beach. They
                    would play volleyball. They would go swimming. They would do things like that,
                    that was fine, but they never in general left the hotel environs. When I told
                    the marine commander, I was going into the city, what about putting marines into
                    the car occasionally and letting them get out and see what's out there. He could
                    not understand why that would “help their mission.” I tried explaining that the
                    more they knew about the city the more they more they knew about the culture the
                    more it would help them to defend us in case there was an attack. It would by
                    seeing the culture outside, by seeing the city streets; they would be able to
                    determine more easily whether somebody was friendly or hostile approaching them.
                    I did occasionally get someone out, but only very occasionally. The marines sort
                    of SOP is if you're assigned to a place, you stay there, you do not leave it. I
                    saw this also at the embassy in Kabul later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the FBI? Did they get out and around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, they got out and around. They were actually quite funny about
                    it. The FBI would go out in full force. The FBI had swat teams there. I should
                    say this first. At various times we had between 70 and 80 people there. Seventy
                    to 80 let's say, 95% men. Too much testosterone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is essentially to investigate.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>METRINKO: To investigate. Well, you have the support staff for the investigators,
                    too. Let me give you an example. The FBI had a rule that no FBI agent was
                    allowed to go out alone. They had to go out with a swat team. The swat team
                    consisted of four people, including a doctor or a medic with full medical gear.
                    Full medical gear was the size of a suitcase or more. Now, the FBI had to go out
                    with fully armed, they carried long arms. So, if Joe was going down to pick up
                    his dry cleaning or to get some cereal at one of the little grocery stores he
                    had to go with a swat team of four people. Now the diplomatic security rule was
                    that when the FBI went out there had to be an American driver and an American
                    diplomatic security guard in the car because the FBI had their mission, DS had
                    their mission. This meant that if Joe wanted to go and pick up his laundry, he
                    had four from the swat team and he had the two diplomatic security people. You
                    had Joe plus four plus two that comes out to seven, right? Well, you also had to
                    have a local along who could speak Arabic, that turned out to eight. At this
                    point you're doubling the size of your car. Eight guys with long guns do not fit
                    into one car. So, if Joe went out you had to take two cars. This means that you
                    need another diplomatic security agent to drive the car because only Americans
                    were supposed to drive plus a companion for him, try ten. You were really
                    sitting in high speeds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling of coming from the embassy or
                        someplace, you know, perhaps if you people get going the quicker you'd get
                        the hell out of here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, there was very much that feeling, but you couldn't say it because
                    the FBI was very sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that they were able to operate in
                        this sort of thing? How did they, you know, interface with the local people
                        in order to find out what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They interfaced with an attitude of hostility, an attitude that the
                    local authorities were screwing up the investigation. It's quite possibly true.
                    The local authorities had no great desire to have this drag on, but they had no
                    great desire to bring it to an end either. The local authorities' answer would
                    have been to take the people they had grabbed and to have them executed after a
                    quick trial. They wanted it over and done with. The FBI didn't want a quick
                    trial. They wanted to go on and on investigating forever hoping that leads would
                    lead them to other leads, to other leads, to terrorism as a world network. Yemen
                    wanted this to be over and done with. They saw it as a specific problem, a
                    specific incident. They wanted the incident to be wiped out, the perpetrators
                    punished and let's go on from there. The FBI wanted to find out more that might
                    impact on other investigations and other problems. They were both right in their
                    own ways.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself sort of the oil between the two
                        systems or something? Was that you felt your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A bit of that. It was also oil between the various gears inside of the
                    investigator who came as well because we had agencies who not only did not talk
                    to each other, we were all sort of sitting there having to talk to each
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, with that many people around, let's say you
                        turned up a promising informant, what would happen? I could see a former
                        [official] sort of sitting at a coffee table and whispering out to somebody
                        and all of a sudden you have to face a barrage of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You are now being brought before 80 people for your oral exam each of
                    whom is going to have several questions. I never went to any of the sessions. I
                    wasn't supposed to, so I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that in
                    general they only spoke to people who were presented to them by the local
                    authorities. They had a list of people they wanted to talk to. The local
                    authorities would produce these people or not produce these people. It was
                    unclear who some of these people really were. Some of them were unproduceable or
                    were not going to be produced. Possibly because they were being protected.
                    Possibly because we didn't have the right names. Possibly because no such people
                    existed. Possibly because they hadn't been found.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all the feeling that there were training
                        camps off in sort of a hydramoot? You know, things were happening now over
                        the horizon in Yemen that were not designed to be beneficial to the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, there was very much that feeling. There was a feeling that some of
                    the officials were in conclusion with the people who had attacked the Cole or
                    with people who had supported the ones who had attacked the Cole. Again, this
                    was very difficult to penetrate. Yemen can be a very, very close; it is a very
                    closed society. Fifty percent of the country, the women are closed off
                    completely, you never see women. The men themselves are just different. I
                    learned very little about Yemen my first time. This was actually my second time.
                    I learned very little about Yemen. I learned about the streets of Aden. I
                    learned a lot about a couple of officials. I learned a lot about things that
                    didn't really touch on Yemen very much. I learned a lot about interagency
                    fighting, interagency sort of rivalry, interagency lack of cooperation. I didn't
                    learn a great deal about Yemen. I learned more about Yemen when I went back last
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I was there for almost exactly three months, from March until June of
                    the year 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it, was it still the same situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No. What happened was in late May, I don't remember the exact date,
                    either late May or early June of the year 2000. I received a phone call telling
                    us to pack up and leave immediately. There was indication that we were being
                    targeted and the NSC wanted us out of there immediately. They told us to abandon
                    the hotel and get out and move out. What we did was we stayed, well, I got most
                    of the people out that day. I got the FBI and the marines out on a C130 we
                    called them. The other State person, myself and, I'm sorry, the other diplomatic
                    security people, my deputy in the State Department, myself and several others
                    left the next day taking all the cars, the vehicles and records with us. We had
                    a great trip going back to Sanaa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did you do, just go up to Sanaa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Went up to Sanaa and everybody went home. I left after four or five
                    days. My tour was up anyway. It was close to being up anyway because of my
                    status. I'd already worked 90 days straight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea of what this threat was or did you
                        ever find out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I did, but I can't talk about it. It may have been overstated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean these things often are, but one can't,
                        everybody gets very. While you were there had the Cole left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, yes, the Cole had long since gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, how, did Barbara Bodine our
                        ambassador sort of win or lose or how did this come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Ambassador Bodine won, but it was a psychic victory. Yes, she
                    established the primacy of the Department of State as the foreign affairs agency
                    in charge of our operations in Yemen. She maintained that. Yes, she maintained
                    herself as the lead U.S. government official and she kept that in Yemen dealing
                    with the Yemeni government. What she did, however, by having a battle with the
                    FBI was lose or let herself open to a lot of attacks on her reputation back here
                    in the United States. In that sense it was a psychic victory. I have a great
                    deal of respect for her. I thought she was a pretty good ambassador. She had a
                    very tough role to play there. It was a tough job. It wasn't fair that the FBI
                    attacked her or tried to attack her. They saw her as a problem. They saw her as
                    somebody who was [in collusion] with the Yemeni government and it went back and
                    forth. FBI people changed all the time. In fact, one of the problems of the
                    investigation was that most people were there on a 30 day rotation. I was
                    supposed to stay for as long as possible. My deputy was supposed to stay for as
                    long as possible, but the other Department of State people, diplomatic security
                    rotated out every 30 days. The FBI rotated out every 30 days. Others rotated
                    out. So, in the course of three months there, when you keep an average of 60 to
                    80 people at any one time and they are rotating out every month, you have a huge
                    number of people who come and go. I got to meet 18 to 20 different diplomatic
                    security people there. It went on like that. It just kept switching and rotating
                    out. Some very, very good, some great in fact. Some very, not so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back from that, do you think that, I mean did
                        anybody, was anybody other than what we're doing right now talk to you who
                        was in an official capacity, lessons learned on this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Nobody ever asked me a question about it. In fact when I came back and
                    called up the Department and said I'm here, would you like me to come in and do
                    a debrief? They did not think it was necessary. That was the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This of course is the thing that people who come out of
                        extremely trying circumstances or something and when they come back, nobody
                        asks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I know. I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it's one reason why this oral history program is
                        going. It's very late, but there are lots of lessons to be learned if
                        somebody wants to look at it. All right, then, you came back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, one thing, one lesson I did learn there, I always point this out
                    to people who are involved in security. We had several different armed groups.
                    We had a fasting of marines who were there to combat the other; the teams set up
                    to do anti-terrorism work and they were bright gung ho marines, real
                    jarheads.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these were here to protect you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They were there to protect me and to protect the premises. They were
                    bright young guys and really, really good. Like I say, I came out of there with
                    a very healthy respect for marines. We had the FBI, which was fully armed. The
                    swat teams were heavily armed. We had the CIA, which was armed. We had DIA that
                    was armed. We had NCIS that was armed and we had of course the FBI in general
                    that was armed. We had diplomatic security that was armed. When I got there I
                    asked the question of what their rules of engagement were. It turned out they
                    had never talked to each other about this and they had at least three if not
                    more totally different rules of engagement. So, if there ever had been an
                    incident it would have been very interesting as different armed people responded
                    in totally different ways. This is a lesson for anyone going off to manage
                    diplomatic, an organization where there are different types of armed people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's one of those things you don't really think
                        about except.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That was my old War College training though. I learned that there. I
                    tell you something, if you're in a car driven by the Department of State
                    Diplomatic Security and you have the FBI with you and someone attacks the car,
                    you have totally different responses. What I would do would be every time there
                    was a turnover of the head of any of those groups, bring them in immediately,
                    let them sit down in a closed room with the heads of the other armed groups and
                    say, guys, straighten this out now. You're the ones who determine what the rules
                    are, straighten out and make sure you're all playing from the same amount of
                    deck of cards and they did. It worked out, but it would take a while.
                    Anyway.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Well, okay, you came back. At the time you were on a temporary assignment
                    being retired. You could only work so many hours and all and you'd kind of run
                    that to the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I came back in June of I guess it was the year 2001 and basically
                    relaxed and took it easy for a while. I did some work in the house. I did a
                    major house renovation project that took about two months. Lots of painting,
                    ripping up floors, putting in a bathroom, that whole bit. The stuff that we do
                    with money that we earn. I was doing a bit of traveling. 2001 on 9/11 I happened
                    to be in my home watching TV. I had a Palestinian housemaid who was doing some
                    work in the family room, too and the TV was on and at the time we had a Turkish
                    mullah living with us as well who was doing graduate work at Catholic University
                    in philosophy. The news was on and we saw the plane going into Twin Tower, the
                    first of them. I just assumed like the others watching that it was a movie clip
                    and then shortly thereafter the other one and shortly thereafter the Pentagon
                    and everyone's life changed. The Turkish mullah, the Palestinian, my own life,
                    my Iranian roommate wasn't home at the time, but his life has certainly changed
                    because of that. I called up the Department not long after and volunteered to go
                    to Afghanistan. I did some traveling anyway. I went to Poland for two weeks. I
                    went to Holland for a week, private travel, just to go to Europe for vacation.
                    The Department called me up I guess it was early December and asked if I'd be
                    interested in going to Kabul and I said yes. They didn't know exactly when I'd
                    be gong, but they said I'd be going quite shortly. I made what I thought was a
                    correct assumption. I said, “Well, if I'm going to be going maybe I should join
                    whatever group you have doing orientation in NFATC to go off to Kabul. This is
                    to reopen the embassy.” There was this pause. NEA/SA/EX said, “Well, we don't
                    have anybody going to orientation. We're just sending people.” I said, “You're
                    opening up a new embassy in a place we haven't been since 1989 and you don't
                    have people to speak the language and you're not going to give them orientation
                    on how to open an embassy up?” “No.” Sorry for the laughter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What happened is that I was scheduled for some foot surgery. I went in
                    for foot surgery and approximately, three or four days after I was back home
                    with my foot in a full cast and limping around with a cane and everything else
                    and a walker, I got a call from the Department asking if I could come in that
                    day that my passport was ready. So, I made an appointment for late in the
                    afternoon. I called up my foot doctor. I went out there and told him to break
                    the cast off. I put my foot in a regular black dress shoe, went into the
                    Department smiling, did the paperwork, did everything else. I wanted to make
                    sure that they didn't know that my foot had been in a cast or they might have
                    stopped me from going. I came home and almost died with the pain. Luckily there
                    was a break for about another week or ten days and my foot had a chance to heal.
                    The doctor of course told me I was crazy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: But I mean doctors do that. I went to Afghanistan; I went off to
                    Kabul.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression before you went? I have an
                        interview with Ann Williams who went. Did Ann Wright go with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ann got there with a group of four or five others late in December,
                    mid-December. I got there in mid-January. I replaced Ann.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the reason I asked was that when they put together
                        this crew, here you had a very important thing, opening up an embassy in a
                        country which was under sort of siege in the middle of a war, but very
                        important to make it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Under everyone's microscope.</p>
                <p>Q: Under everyone's microscope. I mean here is the Department of State with all
                    its expertise and particularly you have a bureau who in theory should be able to
                    reach in and come from active duty people and all of a sudden I mean I have you
                    and I have Ann Wright. I don't know about the others who were retirees, they're
                    not part of the active process.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Ann was actually not retired at the time. She resigned later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she had no experience in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No experience in the area. I had experience in the area and I also have
                    the language. I don't know if they even knew that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the thing, you know, it doesn't sound like, was it
                        that the well was empty when they reached in the South Asian cadre of people
                        to go to Afghanistan I mean as far as personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm not sure. I can't answer that question. I don't know what sort of
                    planning process went on. I was sort of amazed myself when I got there and
                    discovered that the people there, one or two had had experience in the area.
                    They had been to Pakistan for example. They'd been the Afghan watchers, but in
                    general very few of the Americans assigned there knew a damn thing about
                    Afghanistan or the region. We got there, when I got there it was an embassy
                    under siege. I lived in a bomb shelter for awhile because there was no place
                    else to live. I shoveled out my own office before I could get in my own
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about it. How did you, you went there
                        when? In the first place you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I was there altogether from mid-January of the year 2002 until
                    mid-August of 2002. I went originally on what was supposed to be a one or two
                    month assignment. It got extended.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what, when they assigned you there, what were you to do?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: I went there as chief of the political section replacing Ann.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. She said her time in Afghanistan had been as a hippie
                        back in the '60s I think going there in a pickup truck with a bunch of other
                        kids you know having a good time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, she had had less experience in the area than I had. I had had my
                    seven years in Iran so I spoke the language. I had been to Afghanistan in 1970
                    on a drug trail. I was in the Peace Corps. I spent a week in Herat basically
                    getting stoned at the time as a hippie. I got back there in 1995 briefly just
                    for one day to do an inspection of a refugee camp down near Dowlatabad, but I
                    had been responsible for Afghanistan when I was an office director in the
                    population refugees and migration. The Afghan refugee problem had been part of
                    my responsibilities. So, I had followed it more or less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were bringing in something. What did you see when you
                        arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I have to disassociate my memory from my last couple of months there
                    from what was there a year ago or a year and a half ago. When I arrived in
                    January of the year 2002, Kabul was a city that was it seemed empty and dark.
                    Dark because there was no electricity, empty because much of the population had
                    abandoned it. There were whole huge parts of the city where no one lived. It was
                    a city filled with wreckage, not from our war, but from previous wars. The whole
                    western quarter of the city was in ruins from the wars. A whole third of the
                    city or so, a quarter of the city, had been leveled by Afghans fighting Afghans.
                    Every building that we saw was damaged. Window glass was missing from every
                    public building. Most of the wiring had been ripped out of buildings and sold to
                    get the copper. Telephone lines didn't exist. Telephone poles didn't exist.
                    Electric light bulbs didn't exist. They'd all been taken down and sold. There
                    was very little traffic. People who had cars... The number of shops that were
                    open was minimal. It looked grim, depressing. Smoke always hung over the city
                    because the only way to get heat was to burn wood or charcoal. Therefore, anyone
                    who had heat was doing it from a wood burning stove. It had always been a city
                    with pollution problems. Pollution was very, very heavy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's in a bowl.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>METRINKO: In a bowl sort of, yes and sort of not a mist, but clouds and dust hung
                    out over everything. There had been a drought for five years straight so it was
                    all very, very dry. Lots of feces around because there were animals in the
                    streets and the streets were never cleaned. The embassy compound when we arrived
                    was surprisingly in good shape when we arrived. We proceeded to wreck it
                    afterwards, but it was a very large many acred compound in the grand style of
                    the '50s and filled with trees and gardens which had been kept in very good
                    shape by the Afghans who had continued to work there. The embassy itself never
                    closed completely. FSNs continued to staff it, not the chancery. The chancery
                    was closed and sealed, but the Taliban never entered the chancery so it was
                    closed, sealed and every office was fully furnished. There was paper on the
                    desks, things like that. They had just simply locked up the building and walked
                    out after parking all the cars in the basement.</p>
                <p>The gardens were quite lovely. Flowers were in bloom. Roses, other flowers. The
                    embassy gardeners continued to work at it. When I arrived there were already
                    about 100 U.S. marines there, again combat marines. They blocked off the main
                    entrance to the embassy and were using a small entranceway out to the side. The
                    marines. When I arrived the embassy had a high stone wall around it, pathways,
                    gardens, lots of trees; it was fairly green because it was irrigated. The number
                    of people keep rising only exponentially. It was just bursting at the seams
                    within another month or two. When I arrived it wasn't so bad yet. We had marines
                    who had occupied basically the entire main floor of the embassy. It was their
                    floor and their job was to lay endless miles of concertina wire all around the
                    embassy compound blocking off pathways, blocking off buildings, putting it on
                    top of the stone wall. Then between the marines and diplomatic security, they
                    cut down almost all the trees in the compound to get a line of sight in case
                    they were attacked. Someone said the line of sight also means that you're
                    exposing yourself because now the enemy can see you, but this was not marine or
                    diplomatic security logic at the time. They just cut down all the trees. The
                    gardens went, too under the bulldozers and under the trucks and under the cars
                    and everything else, they simply disappeared. It was a mess.</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>When I first arrived the marines had the entire main floor of the embassy, the
                    chancery. The charg�, Brian Crocker, and his wife were using what had at once
                    been the ambassador's office at their home or their residence. A number of us
                    were sleeping in what had been built as a bomb shelter on the embassy compound.
                    It was at least 10 or 12 of us in this small sort of underground rooms. Some of
                    the people were staying in areas that had been cleaned up inside the chancery,
                    the communicators, the diplomatic security ref there. Slowly over the next
                    several weeks we cleaned office by office. Every office had to be sort of
                    checked by a bomb squad of course and other things. We started to clean offices
                    out one by one and started to function from the offices. We also cleaned out
                    some of the larger rooms in the embassy and moved our living quarters up there.
                    The reason I say that. In this bomb shelter there was a common room where we ate
                    and we could watch a little bit of TV and we had one e-mail or one Internet
                    screen, the only one on the compound. There were two other bedrooms, one for
                    men, one for women and there was a bathroom. In the hallway the cooks did the
                    cooking. So, all the dishes, well, the marines always ate by themselves in the
                    chancery. All the civilians ate down there and we were eating from dishes that
                    were washed next to the toilet everybody was using and next to the shower. In
                    fact you'd have to stand in line waiting, it was either wash dishes or take a
                    shower. Wash dishes, go to the toilet. It was unhygienic to say the least and
                    all the food was piled up right next to where you were sleeping, too. I got to
                    know the sleeping habits or at least the sleeping clothing of too many Foreign
                    Service officers. It wasn't a pretty sight.</p>
                <p>It was interesting. There was a great deal of camaraderie because we were down to
                    essentials. You didn't have to dress well. There was no attempt to dress up. You
                    couldn't in fact. We wore very casual clothes because everything was filthy. We
                    were doing as much physical labor as [anything]. I'm trying to think of the
                    other conditions there. The number of usable bathrooms for the people there was
                    minimal. A hundred marines I think shared one toilet. When we moved out of that
                    bomb shelter which was maintained as a residence for a very long time... In fact
                    it was just ripped down a few months ago so it was maintained as a residence for
                    about a year and a half. When we moved into the chancery building, there were
                    about 40 or 50 of us using two toilets and one shower. It was an old men's room
                    that was just converted. They took out one of the toilets and turned it into a
                    shower stall and they kept the other toilets and there was a sink in there, too.
                    This meant that if you wanted to take a shower you had to get up very early in
                    the morning - and I'd get up around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning to get my shower
                    - because there would be a line very quickly afterwards. I slept in a room that
                    had been the room where the ambassador's and DCM's secretaries had slept and
                    that was our dormitory room for about five months until July as a matter of
                    fact.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: My work was self-invented. I was political counselor. I was also head
                    of the economic section. I was also as it turned out by default chief of the
                    consular section so I had three jobs. When they discovered that I knew consular
                    work, CA sent me a commission in the mail. Gary Ryan signed a letter saying I
                    had a consular commission for Kabul, for Afghanistan and so I was blessed with a
                    very, very good FSN who had remained in the consular section. He had been hired
                    during the Taliban period. His father had been the chief FSN in the consular
                    section for about 30 years and in the true Afghan way when he retired he
                    recommended his son and his son had taken over his job. He was a godsend. He was
                    really great.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: What was I doing? We had innumerable lost passports. We had innumerable

                <p>METRINKO: Yes. Afghan Americans would come back after being away for years and
                    years and years. We had one repatriation case of a woman who had mental
                    problems, an Afghan, American. I was also trying, CA had sent in a very
                    experienced consular officer for about two weeks at the very beginning to look
                    at what was there, to open up the files, to destroy old files, to ship things
                    back that required shipping back because everything had simply been left there
                    including a lot of fairly sensitive consular case files. He had worked it out;
                    he and I got along very well when he realized that I knew consular work. He knew
                    who I was and we talked about it. He suggested to CA that instead of his coming
                    back because he was also a rover and it made a lot of sense just to give me the
                    commission and to let me stay there and do the job part time along with my
                    political work. There was certainly a relationship between the work symbiotic
                    relationship if you will. Consular work is very closely related to political,
                    political to consular. Using my consular hat I could get into see the police, I
                    could get into the president, I could get into hospitals. I could things like
                    that and using my political work, I could do things that impacted on consular
                    work. In fact it was the ideal consular political relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, arrest cases. One had the feeling that there really
                        wasn't much law there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0270" n="Page0270"/>
                <p>METRINKO: One has the feeling there still isn't very much law there. Law is a
                    personal thing there. If you're rich or if you're powerful, law has a different
                    meaning than if you're a normal Joe Schmo on the street. There was law. One
                    potentially thorny arrest case got resolved because the people involved in it
                    all had money and they straightened it out for themselves. They told us about it
                    afterwards. I didn't have to go to see any prisoners. We didn't have any that
                    were in prison. Although I did an inspection of the local prison. The
                    repatriation case involved local police officials, but, no that was different,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you, with the mental case, how did you get him or
                        her on the plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: With difficulty. A departing Foreign Service officer agreed to escort
                    the person down to Islamabad. Much of our consular caseload was handled by
                    Islamabad. You couldn't get a visa for example in Kabul. You had to go to
                    Islamabad, although we could send visa cases, of the VIPs, we could send the
                    package down to Islamabad to be processed. That's where we would send the
                    passport applications and things of that sort. We would do the paperwork and
                    then send it down to Islamabad since we didn't really have the other necessary
                    things. In the case of repatriation, I had her escorted down to Islamabad and
                    then escorted from Islamabad all the way to the United States, but by FSOs who
                    happened to be traveling and agreed to do it, in fact, volunteered to do it and
                    a good thing, too because it was a person who needed help and shouldn't begin a
                    case, the person should not have been traveling overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, tell me about this time between January and
                        August, the political situation and what you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: January to August saw the Afghan government had only been in office for
                    about three weeks at this point, three weeks to a month. Among other things that
                    I saw was the raising of the new Afghan flag over the presidential palace, the
                    opening of several new embassies, one assassination, followed later on by
                    another assassination of government ministers. The first one I knew, the
                    minister of transportation. I saw the government starting to form come to grips
                    with its own problems to realize that it didn't even have a grasp on what the
                    country was like anymore. I was very much a part of the first grand council that
                    was summoned to sort of talk about, discuss and formalize what the transition
                    government would look like. In fact, I was seconded to the United Nations for a
                    couple of weeks in the middle of the summer so that I could go off and do some
                    election work in the provinces with groups of Afghans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United Nations supervising this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0271" n="Page0271"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. The United Nations agency for Afghanistan. It was supervising
                    setting up the elections and I volunteered. Well, I should explain this. I
                    wasn't the only political officer. I was the political consular, a title that we
                    designated for me, the DCM and the charg� and I. I was there as the person who
                    was going to stay. I stayed January to August. In the meantime we had a full
                    series of TDY people who had come in for three weeks, a month, and come and go
                    and come and go. Sometimes we had three or four officers. Sometimes we had just
                    me. It depended. Most of the time I had deputies. It was difficult because it
                    meant that portfolios kept changing. There was no consistency, no continuity.
                    The DCM also handled a lot of the political work. Everyone did. Throughout this
                    period we had innumerable visits by Zalmay Khalilzad. You spell that ZALMAY,
                    first name, KHALILZAD, the president's special envoy for Afghanistan. He came in
                    and would spend any time from a couple of days up to several weeks in Kabul
                    dealing directly with the Afghan government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That's a question that would fill an entire tape. Zalmay Khalilzad was
                    an Afghan American who had been born and brought up in Afghanistan. He certainly
                    knew most of the new government cabinet members - I mean knew most of the
                    warlords - because he had been dealing with Afghanistan off and on for most of
                    his life. He'd been involved in the Department of Defense and State Department
                    before as a political appointee. He had dealt with Afghanistan then. He knew
                    people from his own studies, his academic work. He also has followed it his
                    whole life. He was of course surely interested in what happened there. He spoke
                    [two languages] along with English. He had gone to school with some of the
                    leaders either in Afghanistan or later on in a university in Beirut. He
                    certainly had the President's ear back in the White House and the head of the
                    National Security Council, Condoleezza Rice. That having been said, I'm not sure
                    how effective he was. He caused as many problems as he helped things there. He's
                    been named as the new ambassador to Afghanistan. I found his approach, his
                    personality and his work to counterproductive myself and the antipathies of what
                    I think of as good diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way would you strive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, there was a problem in Afghanistan that's continued up until
                    quite recently where there were too many people who represented the United
                    States government at a high level. We had a military occupation of the country.
                    The general in charge of the U.S. military effort there whether it was General
                    McNeil saw himself as the lead American in the country. If you had 8,000, 9,000,
                    10,000 soldiers under your command, a couple of large bases and U.S. military
                    stationed all over the country in small towns and cities you are indeed in
                    charge of a large portion of the country. He was conducting a military campaign
                    there. We had a very large CIA presence there which had its own headquarters
                    building in the middle of the city heavily protected, fortified and all the
                    traffic walked off around it. We had the U.S. embassy there with Bryan Crocker
                    as charg� and then Robert Finn who was the ambassador. We had as time went on
                    this gets into my second assignment there already, but we had an ambassador who
                    was in charge of coordination for development, Bill Taylor. We also had a
                    political advisor out at the army headquarters who was also an ambassador and
                    had ambassadorial rank as ambassador to the army operation there, the military
                    operation. So, we had a general, two other ambassadors in addition to the State
                    Department ambassador plus the head of the CIA all of them with entree with
                    clout with some degree of power and not all of them necessarily talking to each
                    other about what they were doing. To give you an anecdote that will best explain
                    this. I heard this from President [Karzai]'s brother; he's a friend of mine,
                    several months ago. This was at a time when President [Karzai] was thinking of
                    getting rid of Ismail Kham, I-S-M-A-I-L, new word K-H-A-M, who was the warlord
                    governor and military commander of Herat Province. President [Karzai] called in
                    the British ambassador and these were the words he used in front of his
                    brother-in-law. He said, “I've just spoken to three different American
                    ambassadors about the American viewpoint on getting rid of Ismail Kham and I've
                    gotten three conflicting viewpoints. Can you please tell me what the British
                    view is?” Now adding to the mixture of American ambassadors I have to also had
                    the President's special envoy who came and went came and went constantly and was
                    on the phone when he wasn't there. So, you had [the envoy], you had Ambassador
                    Taylor, you had Ambassador Finn, you had Ambassador Jackovitz, you had the CIA
                    director and you had the head of the army operations. That's six. It was
                    incredibly inept on the part of the State Department and Defense to do it that
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you see the, I mean was there the conflict that
                        seems to be going on or has been going on for the last two years between the
                        State Department and Colin Powell and the Department of Defense under
                        Rumsfeld and I'm particularly talking when you get to the Department of
                        Defense you're talking about the civilian leadership, the rotating
                        leaderships is almost a different matter. Did you get that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0273" n="Page0273"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, absolutely. Let me give you an example first before I address that
                    question, an example of the sort of lack of cooperation or the lack of
                    coordination between the various government entities. The second day that I was
                    in Kabul I was taken to an impromptu with the President in his palace. It was
                    myself, it was the charg�, it was a visiting director of AID and we went out to
                    see _____ in his office and it ended up being about a two hour meeting and we
                    sat there and talked development. This was the introductory to the head of AID.
                    _____'s brother was also in the meeting. In the middle of the meeting the phone
                    rang or no a messenger came in and handed [him] a piece of paper and he said,
                    “Gentleman, excuse me, I have a very phone call and I have to take it.” He left.
                    He was gone 15 or 20 minutes and he came back and he said, “Thank you for
                    waiting. I'm sorry. That was Mr. _____.” He sat down and we proceeded. He didn't
                    tell us what [he] had said in his 15 or 20 minutes of conversation calling from
                    the NSC nor did _____ ever tell anybody what he said to _____. That's an example
                    of the sort of thing that was going on there when one presidential, you know,
                    the president's special advisor calls the head of the country and the charg�
                    doesn't know what's happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep saying the charg�...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, because Brian Crocker was sent there in December of the year 2001
                    as charg�. He was there until approximately I want to say March when he was
                    replaced by Robert Finn who came as ambassador. He arrived there as charg� and
                    he was in fact I swore him in as ambassador on the steps of the embassy because
                    I was consular officer and I could take his oath.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back to where, were you seeing the State civilian
                        leadership of the Pentagon conflict played out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A little bit, yes. I can't answer the personal relations of say the
                    ambassador or Ambassador Taylor with the head of the military operation. I had
                    the feeling it was pretty good. At least within limits, but the fact was that
                    one had all the toys, all the money and did not have to explain or say anything
                    at all to the other. So, we would find out about military operations afterwards
                    for example. One example I can give is when what's the deputy, oh, the deputy
                    over at at DOD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wolfowitz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Wolfowitz, thank you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul Wolfowitz.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0274" n="Page0274"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Paul Wolfowitz came on a visit. Everybody came on a visit. Half of the
                    U.S. congress, you know it was their various times on visits, everyone with any
                    sort of grasp at all or anyone with any degree or title at all wanted to show up
                    in Afghanistan during that first year to say he or she had done that. Paul
                    Wolfowitz came on a visit just after we had had the problem of an attack on a
                    wedding party. I was sent up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Okay. In very late June or early July, it was either the last day of
                    June or the first day of July, 2001, 2002 now, yes 2002. There was a military
                    operation near the town of Dehrawod, D-E-H-R-A-W-O-D, and in this particular
                    operation a large group of people who were celebrating a wedding were apparently
                    attacked by U.S. military forces. It happened to be women and children. It was
                    the women and children's part of the wedding. A large number of women and
                    children were killed. A larger number were injured. They were basically bombed.
                    The U.S. military was acting on information that there may have been
                    “terrorists” or Al Qaeda people present at the gathering. It claims it did not
                    know it was a wedding. We heard about it the next day because it happened at the
                    home of someone who happened to be close to one of his huge supporters and [he]
                    was fighting to get back to Afghanistan. He was told that his friend and his
                    friend's family had been killed in this attack. We set up an investigation team
                    and went quickly. We heard about this late in the evening and by early the next
                    morning I joined a special forces team and a group of Afghans including one
                    minister and two deputy ministers to go up by helicopter and then by vehicle by
                    land to visit Dehrawod to see what had really happened to begin the
                    investigation. We conducted the investigation. We spent about two days up there
                    and came back to Kabul to report to the president and to the ambassador together
                    in a joint report. Two days later Wolfowitz showed up and I was asked at a
                    country team to give a briefing about this operation and explained what we had
                    see and Wolfowitz interrupted me and said, “You sound like you believe the
                    Afghans' version.” He said it in a very sort of peremptory way. I said, “Well,
                    I'm only reporting what I saw” and he dismissed it and said, “No, it didn't
                    happen that way.” Click, his line shut down. He was in denial. I returned to
                    that same village a while later, about a month later when a fuller investigation
                    team with people on it who could actually do measurements and do forensics and
                    things like that came through. I accompanied them up to the same area with the
                    same special forces team, but it was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a real problem I think, it's unfortunate it's
                        gotten very political, but it's much more serious than that particularly
                        with true believers, the civilian true believers in the Department of
                        Defense. Well, now as a political officer what did you do? I mean what were
                        the politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0275" n="Page0275"/>
                <p>METRINKO: What were the politics? That's a good question. What did I do day to
                    day? Afghanistan was a country with no internal communications. We had no idea
                    what was happening in the rest of the country. You could not telephone across
                    the street. Eventually the United Nations gave telephones to the various
                    ministers and to the various ambassadors so that at least we could telephone to
                    the various ministers, but not to the ministries. There were several different
                    phone systems in the country, none of which worked. If you wanted to set up an
                    appointment you had to leave a note or discuss it first and then set it up that
                    way and then go back later for your appointment. We had no idea what was
                    happening one minute's drive out of Kabul. The military had a better idea, but
                    not much better as it turned out in many cases. I would say there was nobody in
                    the embassy at all who had a grasp on what was happening in the country and I
                    include myself in that because I know how big the country is. I know how
                    disparate and how you know, sort of remote villages and towns can be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the CIA because they've been renowned for
                        having operators all over the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, they had a lot of people who couldn't speak a word of the
                    language and ran around in beards and funny clothes and thought they had a grasp
                    of what was happening. I would dismiss all 99% of them as amateurs. They thought
                    that carrying a gun, growing a beard and wearing a bandana around your hair
                    qualified you as an expert. It doesn't. Very simply, it doesn't. What happened
                    there was similar to what happened later in Iraq. Everybody had their little
                    group, their little friends who would report to them what they wanted to report
                    about this area, this town, this tribe, etc. You had the Afghans who had been
                    out of the country for a whole generation, they had been out since the 1970s, 30
                    years almost who thought they were experts. You had Afghans who had never been
                    there who were showing up. You had a whole series of people like that. The
                    instant experts. Americans who had once been there 25 years ago coming in.
                    Almost none of whom could speak the language. You had a lot of disassemblage,
                    bits and pieces of information. What I did on a daily basis in the embassy was
                    number one man the front gate of the embassy, which was a job in itself. We had
                    an embassy compound that was heavily fortified and was getting more and more
                    fortified everyday. There was no feasible way to bring most people into the
                    chancery. Most of the visitors who would show up. It is the Afghan tradition as
                    its a tradition I think in every country when a new government takes power,
                    anybody who wants part of that power, anybody who wants to get anything done
                    shows up and plays homage. Afghans started coming in in large numbers, tribal
                    groups, city groups, town groups, professional groups, people who were looking
                    for jobs, people who were looking for favors, people who were trying to get
                    their nephews out of American prisons, etc. They started showing up at the
                    gates. I was the political officer who spoke [the language]. I got called down
                    to the gates constantly.</p>
                <pb facs="0276" n="Page0276"/>
                <p>We had something else happening at the gate. We had a force protective unit from
                    the U.S. marines, a group with which I had never worked and which I came to hold
                    very quickly in the highest esteem. These were marines. Marine trained, but
                    longer hair, beards, they were there to gather information that would protect
                    the embassy compound and the American presence there. They weren't there to
                    protect the American diplomats, they were there as sort of the outer reach of
                    the marines there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Afghans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, no, these were Americans. These were American marines, but as it
                    turned out some of them had mixed parentage or they were dual nationals. They
                    had gone through very [training], some of which could speak [the language] quite
                    [well]. They had Arabic training. They were also versed in the country. They had
                    studied it. They were supposed to be regional experts and indeed they were. They
                    were really a good group to work with. So, what would invariably happen, one of
                    them would be assigned almost 24 hours down at the main gate, they did this in
                    rotation. They would be the ones to sort out and sift out the people that came.
                    If you had a leader who showed up saying, I have information about 25 stinger
                    missiles and this and that and the other thing and I wanted to turn it over to
                    you, then they would be diverted to the correct person. If somebody came in who
                    wanted to talk about politics, they would call me and I spent a chunk of each
                    day, sometimes several hours a day down at the gate dealing with the people to
                    the extent where they set up a special meeting room. I had innumerable and this
                    happened, when I saw innumerable, everyday, sometimes a couple of times a day
                    tribal groups coming in where I would have five or ten or 20 or 30 men, what
                    they called the white beards, the tribal elders, coming to see the ambassador.
                    The ambassador never wanted to see them, coming to see me it meant. I shouldn't
                    never wanted to see them, my job was to sift out the ones he was supposed to
                    see. They would come to discuss problems, conditions, what was happening in
                    their province, what was happening in their tribal area, the help they needed.
                    In the true Afghan way, nobody knew who was in charge yet. Remember when I say
                    there were no telephone communications, there was also no national TV system.
                    The radio system was in shatters, you know, in shambles as well. There were no
                    newspapers that reached the whole country, so the country had no communication
                    with itself. Nobody knew. If you were living out in a small town, you really
                    didn't know what was happening in Kabul and you didn't really know about the
                    American presence or anything else. It was all new. People would come to the
                    embassy sometimes mistaking it for the CIA or for a wide incredible variety of
                    reasons, everything from hey I'm an American citizen, hey I want to get a visa,
                    hey I wanted to go and study in the United States, I need help. My younger
                    brother was captured by Americans in uniform who took him. We don't know where
                    he is and nobody will tell us. We don't know if he is alive or dead and this
                    happened four months ago. In many cases that happened. My job was to sort out
                    all that. I found it rather refreshing. I was also supposed to be meeting and
                    dealing with a number of officials in the country, dealing with the clergy, did
                    that a great deal, both from meeting people by chance at the gate to just going
                    out and paying calls. Full days. All of those who were there the first many
                    months worked I would say 20 hours a day. It was a function of necessity because
                    we had nothing else to do, but to work. The only place I could sit in a chair
                    was in my office because there were no other chairs. I could go and sit outside.
                    If I wanted to sit in a real chair, I had my office chair sitting in front of my
                    desk in front of my screen on my computer. I didn't have a chair in the large
                    room I was sharing with eight or ten other men.</p>

                <pb facs="0278" n="Page0278"/>
                <p>METRINKO: A barrage of reports on everything possible because nobody had reported
                    from inside of Afghanistan since the year 1989. Everything from biographic
                    reporting on the new leaders on officials, condition reporting to who may have
                    killed the minister of tourism, I mean everything, the whole spectrum. There was
                    no, we didn't know the economy yet. We didn't know the commercial system yet. We
                    were trying to sort out who the political players were as the Afghans were
                    because politicians their representatives, their envoys were coming in drifting
                    back to Afghanistan in dribs and drabs. They had all the anti-Taliban
                    politicians, they had all left the country, and they were gone. They started
                    coming back, one after the other as a matter of making contact with them,
                    getting to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, were you seeing a country that was
                        in complete disarray or were you beginning to see it beginning to knit
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'll give you an example. One of the first or second month that I was
                    there, we had a visitor come in from INR in the Department who wanted to do a
                    study of the police, what the police were up to, who they were, what they were.
                    This was important to me both for consular work and for political work. I was
                    the control officer and he and I spent about a week together just visiting
                    police stations all over Kabul, talking to police officials all up and down the
                    line from the new chief of police to the minister of interior people to
                    policemen on the beat so to speak, going out to the police academy. One of the
                    questions I asked in one of the first meetings of a police official was, “Okay,
                    you're here, do you have contact with police officials [there] and in other
                    cities?” He said, “We know there must be police out there, but we don't know who
                    they are because we have no way to reach them, we have no way to contact them.
                    There are no phones.” He said, “In theory do we have contact? In fact, no, I
                    can't give you any names because I don't know any of these people or who they
                    are.” These are some of the top ranking police stations in Kabul. That was in
                    the year 2002. 2003 there's a radio network that links the police. The police go
                    from the provinces to training at the new police academy in Kabul. So, is the
                    country coming together? Yes. Is it coming together fast? No. Is it coming
                    together fast by Asian terms? Probably yes. I'm not pessimistic about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course we have a problem with our time frame of
                        reference. It's not their problem. What were you getting at that time during
                        this particular period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0279" n="Page0279"/>
                <p>METRINKO: [Karzai] was quite popular, but nobody knew very much about him. There
                    was not a great deal of biographic information about him. He was sort of picked
                    and chosen by the foreigners to head the country. He was very presentable. He
                    spoke excellent English. He spoke all the politically correct words. He could be
                    charming. He is charming. He was recognized by warlords and by the various power
                    brokers all around the country as the one person who could appease all the
                    foreigners with money. I think that there are a great many people, warlords in
                    any particular city or town there who would like to be president of Afghanistan,
                    but they also all know that they don't have the ability to represent Afghanistan
                    to the foreigners who give the money that keeps Afghanistan running. So, he is
                    in power because he can do that. He's the ultimate fixer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the work of the NGOs, the
                        non-governmental organizations, both American and foreign and
                        international?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That's another question that would take a good hour of discussion. I'll
                    put it this way. NGOs went to Afghanistan not asking what Afghanistan needed or
                    what should be done, but they went there with their own specialties and then
                    proceeded to ask monies that they could apply their specialties to Afghanistan.
                    In general the development assistance work for Afghanistan was not well
                    coordinated. I say this specifically about AID. I say this about the NGOs, the
                    IOs, despite the meetings, the talk there is not a great deal of coordination
                    and not a great deal of expertise. Huge amounts of money was thrown down rat
                    holes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, we're sort of running out of time for this time.
                        Obviously we want to come back again, but again, I'd like to put at the end
                        here, let's talk about your impressions during this first period in Kabul of
                        some of the, why you didn't think the NGOs and the AID works were not, I
                        mean, what rat holes you saw money going down or you know, misguided efforts
                        there. Also, I'd like to ask you, you raised it before and I didn't pick it
                        up then, but could you tell me about how adoptions because this is always a
                        very sensitive thing on the consular side, how that was all working and then
                        something about other armed forces which were picking up with armed forces
                        being there. I think other groups have been doing this, the Germans, the
                        British, and others who had sent troops there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Even the various different American armed groups, which are very
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk about that during this specific
                        period and also foreign influence. I mean, what you were seeing.</hi>

                        also about the Taliban at this time. Then later you came back, you went to
                        Herat and that was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The first time I was in Afghanistan during this period I arrived in
                    January. I left on a short break in July and then I, no I left on a short break
                    in June, came back and left again in August to go to Yemen. I was in Yemen for
                    four months as chief of the consular section. I left Yemen in January of 2003
                    with an onward assignment again to go back to Afghanistan and arrived back in
                    Afghanistan in March of 2003 and I was there until August, six straight
                    months.</p>

                        about the first time in Kabul and then I would like to talk to you about
                        being a consular officer in Yemen again and then we'll go back, okay?</hi>

                        series of tapes. Mike, let's do Kabul the first time. You went to Kabul
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I went to Kabul in January of the year 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, how did that come about and in the first place how
                        long were you there in Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was there in Afghanistan that first time from January 2002 up until
                    August although I had a short break in June for about two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come about doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, this all follows from the Twin Towers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about 9/11?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: 9/11.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Trade Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Trade Center and the realization that Afghanistan was involved, the
                    Taliban had supported Osama Bin Laden, etc. and all that great history that we
                    now have etched into our minds. What happened is that I heard that there might
                    be an opening at the embassy? It was in the newspapers that the embassy was
                    going to be reopened. I also heard the Department was looking for volunteers. I
                    called up and volunteered. I was remembered in the Department because I had been
                    in Yemen the preceding year. I had spent several months there. I got a call back
                    from NEA/SA/EX asking me if I was really interested. Yes. Telling me they would
                    definitely like me to be on the list of people going, but just weren't sure
                    exactly when, whether it would be the first group to actually open up the
                    embassy or slightly after that. Then there was silence and it went back and
                    forth like that for a while. You know the State Department never follows up on
                    anything. Eventually I got a call in December again saying they wanted me to go
                    and finally got a date of the second week in January to depart the United
                    States. Of course the Department being the Department I had to get my own visa
                    to go to Pakistan and I had to do everything like that myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went, you got there in January?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I arrived there in January. The embassy had been opened at that point
                    for less than four weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Afghanistan and in Kabul when
                        you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: When I arrived in Kabul in January of 2002 the city was still very
                    quiet, rather grim, very dark. There was no electricity in the entire city. The
                    weather was not cold thank goodness because, at least not freezing cold because
                    people were still using wood and I think manure as well to burn for fires. There
                    was no such thing as oil or gas deliveries or electricity for heating your home,
                    so the entire city was overhung with a miasma of smoke, smoke, dust, grit in the
                    air. There had been a drought for five years preceding this so the city was
                    very, very dry and at least a third if not more of the city was in total ruin.
                    No electricity, a huge ruined section of the city where no one lived, just block
                    after block after block of demolished buildings. These were buildings that had
                    been demolished in the war [against the Soviets and] was not part of the Soviets
                    and not part of our bombing of the city.</p>
                <p>The embassy compound itself was still recognizably the old embassy compound prior
                    to its closure in 1989. It was a very large compound filled with trees,
                    flowering plants, lots of roses, lots of other flowers. Even winter flowers were
                    coming up because the gardens had been very well taken care of by the FSNs who
                    stayed in the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we covered part of this. Do you remember what we
                        covered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't remember, I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let's keep going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. Inside the embassy we had more than 100 combat marines and we had
                    a fairly large staff although relatively few from the State Department. It was
                    more military. The Office of Military Cooperation OMC, various other, AID was
                    starting to come in force. When I arrived in January though it was still very
                    small. Brian Crocker was charg�. His wife was there as the sort of general
                    housekeeper and she should have gotten a medal for her work. There was a very
                    small political section, myself and Ann Wright. Ann Wright left quite shortly
                    afterwards. Ellen Eyre, E-Y-R-E, came in shortly after that. There was no
                    economic section per se. The consular section consisted of one FSN and
                    originally [an officer] who came in for about two weeks just to look at the
                    office to sort of shovel it out to see what files were there to see what could
                    be salvaged from the old consular supplies. It was an embassy where the entire
                    bottom floor was taken over by the marines. They used it as their living space.
                    Most of us stayed in the bomb shelter. We slept in there. Bit by bit started to
                    open up the offices. They had to be swept of course, in both ways. Both to look
                    for traces of eavesdropping equipment as well as to sweep them out because they
                    hadn't been touched by 1989. The building itself was in relatively good shape
                    although it soon became apparent that there was not enough water and there was
                    not enough sewage capacity for the people who are now living in it. It had never
                    been designed as a residential building. It had only been a building for people
                    to work in and for guards to stay occasionally at night. What happened is that
                    suddenly there were upwards of 200 people, 160, 170, 200 living on the compound
                    and there was no sewage capacity. So, things like that had to be taken care of.
                    The trees started falling down one after the other. The marines diplomatic
                    security decided that they need a line of sight in case there was an attack on
                    the embassy so they started cutting down the trees and the shrubbery. Concertina
                    wire started going up very quickly. It had already started all around the
                    perimeter walls and then all around everywhere so that when one approached the
                    gate that was the only egress from the embassy. It was an old gate used in the
                    past by the motor pool as opposed to the visitors. The visitors' gate was
                    permanently sealed off. The new gate was surrounded by a serpentine of
                    concertina wire which made it very difficult to come and go and lots of little
                    marine barricades and lots of barriers. It became part of our daily
                    conversation. Huge, plastic heavy plastic containers, soft containers that could
                    be shipped easily and that would then hold hundreds or thousands of pounds of
                    soil; dirt, sand and you could build them anywhere. You could stack them so you
                    had walls of [sand] barriers going up. They were easy to do. All you had to do
                    was put one down and just like a trash bag start to fill it, except in a square
                    container that had a framework around it. Easy to ship.</p>
                <pb facs="0283" n="Page0283"/>
                <p>The embassy wall which had been a rather pleasant old stone wall became, was soon
                    covered by heavy metal plates stretching all around the perimeter. Plates that
                    went from the top of the wall down below the sidewalk because they dug a sort of
                    trench to install the walls in. The walls were extraordinarily ugly. It looks
                    like a huge metal box now when you look at the embassy. By huge I mean it's more
                    than a block long and a block wide of a metal wall. There was some sort of
                    amusement in all this because the children from the neighborhood soon discovered
                    that if you threw one stone at the wall it sounded like Big Ben. The first time
                    this happened the marines went crazy of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God. You were what, the head of the political
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was in charge of the political section. The job kept changing in
                    title. My actual visiting card and business card said political counselor. I was
                    also in charge of what was supposed to be an economic section and there was the
                    political military designation for a while, too, so I had all those titles,
                    political counselor, POL/MIL officer, political economic counselor and because I
                    had a consular background. As soon as Alan _____ left CA, Consular Affairs sent
                    me a commission in the mail and made me the head of the consular section, too.
                    From January until I think it was July when the consular officer finally arrived
                    I was also the head of the consular section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the consular duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Embassy inquiries about visas, which we were not doing and I don't
                    think, are still being done there. To get a visa if you were an Afghan, if you
                    were a real VIP Afghan we would take your passport and send it down to
                    Islamabad. In some cases we actually sent officers down as couriers to take
                    these down when we had high ranking government delegations leaving Kabul to go
                    to the United States for example. The average person could not get a visa simply
                    could not get a visa. We had a fair number of lost passports or passports that
                    simply expired because Americans, American journalists, business people were
                    rushing into Afghanistan and their passports expired or had expired or they
                    would suddenly realize they had no pages left and they wanted new pages. We
                    would again take those and send them down to Pakistan. I had many inquiries
                    about adoption including one family, an Afghan American family that I believe
                    carried out an adoption although we could only tell them that we didn't know
                    anything about the Afghan adoption laws, that they didn't really have any at
                    that point. We had a couple of arrests, one solid arrest case and a couple of
                    other possible arrest cases, possibly not. They were all settled fairly quickly
                    and one repatriation of an American Afghan who had mental problems and came to
                    Kabul.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0284" n="Page0284"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your solid arrest case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The solid arrest case, well, solid in the sense of an Afghan solidity
                    which is rather fluid. An American Afghan family, young men had returned to
                    Afghanistan, they had money and they had a position in the past. They had
                    property left over from previous regimes. They opened up a business enterprise
                    that was actually very lucrative and got into a major fight which resulted in a
                    street fight which actually resulted with people getting injured by knife wounds
                    because of a problem they were having with tenants. The fight ended up with
                    police and ministry of interior officials actually battling it out on the street
                    with each other. Everybody was of course claiming to have friends in the Afghan
                    government back in the United States and the United Nations. They were arrested,
                    they were taken, they were held. By the time I met them they were already out
                    and they never went back to prison as far as I know. Yes, indeed there were
                    Americans, they were beaten and they were held and that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Contact with the government on doing political work. Were
                        there really parties or was it sort of a well-warned situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: In the beginning it was all individuals and contact was, well, when I
                    arrived there in January there was almost no government. Within one day of my
                    arrival because we had the head of AID visiting, I found myself in President
                    [Karzai]'s office sitting there and having tea for two or three hours in a long
                    meeting. It's not often that you get to meet the president of a country the
                    first or second day. I was sitting there with my jeans on, too by the way
                    because nobody had good clothes with them. I had been told to just bring jeans
                    and sort of nothing decent because there was no way to clean anything. I would
                    say that contact with the government was extremely good, perhaps too good. We
                    could walk into [Karzai]'s office whenever we wanted to. We could get into the
                    palace whenever we wanted to. We could and did meet all of the highest-ranking
                    present and former officials of the country including the former shah when he
                    returned. I immediately met with him. I met with the warlords. I met with the
                    leading clergy and they sought us out, too. If we hadn't gotten to them, they
                    sought us out. I was dealing directly with ministers, directly with the
                    Ayatollah's other high ranking clergy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling, I mean obviously this is what we
                        were all looking at, were things beginning to coalesce, to gel or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0285" n="Page0285"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It's hard to say because we didn't know very much about the country at
                    that point. There was no communication system in the country. We knew a bit
                    about what was happening in the palace. We knew a bit about what was happening
                    on the streets. You have to remember that we had no FSNs, or very few FSNs, and
                    almost nobody who spoke [Pashto] or [Dari]. I was one of two officers in the
                    political section and we were the two officers in the embassy who spoke it for
                    the first couple of months. We had no real connection with anyone out in the
                    provinces except for some of the military teams and they didn't really know what
                    was happening politically out in the provinces and also they weren't reporting
                    to us. We did not do a lot of traveling in the beginning. In fact the embassy
                    still doesn't do a lot of traveling because traveling was difficult. You
                    couldn't go anywhere by car. There was no surface transportation or travel
                    whatsoever. You could not go very far by plane because there was no plane system
                    in the country. You had to go by UN planes; UN helicopters or by military
                    flights and military flights were at best a chancy thing. It was hard to
                    organize them, arrange them and they didn't want to do it just on the drop just
                    because somebody from the embassy wanted to travel. There had to be a very good
                    reason. It was after all a war zone at the time. I remember when INL sent
                    someone in to do a survey of police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: INL, who did they send, God I can't think of the name now, I'm sorry,
                    but from the Department. We wanted to do a survey of the conditions of the
                    Afghan police force. I think he arrived probably in late February and I devoted
                    a major part of a week to go around with him. Number one it was very necessary
                    for me as a consular officer to know this, but it was equally necessary for me
                    as the political officer to know this, too. What were the police doing? We
                    started by going to meet the minister of interior then worked our way down to
                    the chief of police with introductions and then through various precinct
                    commanders. One of the questions I asked first was what about police in other
                    cities, other towns, other villages and what the police commander of Kabul said
                    was, “We assume there are police out there, but we don't know who they are. We
                    have no communication with anybody. We don't have a phone system. We don't have
                    a radio system. We're just assuming that our former police who have taken up
                    their jobs just like we have. We don't know.” This was true of the whole
                    country. You could assume that things were happening, but unless it happened to
                    be a town or a city where there was a reason to go, where [there were] pretty
                    heavy American contingents already, you really did not know what was out
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about you know, during the heavy point of the war, it
                        was certainly one's observation that we had special services and CIA types
                        all over the country doing things. Was there a net of that nature or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0286" n="Page0286"/>
                <p>METRINKO: There was that. There were a lot of guys running around doing stuff. I
                    don't think the policy of what they were doing was ever carefully coordinated or
                    coordinated at all with the embassy. Originally I was in on the briefings that
                    they would give, but then they decided that the briefing should be limited to
                    the ambassador only or to the charg� only. So, nobody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say they, who was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The CIA decided this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: So, within about a month or so the political section was excluded from
                    all briefings by the CIA. They used a variety of gimmicks you know saying we
                    have to get new clearances for you. We have to do this; we have to do that. We
                    have to get this signed off by our headquarters, but they were lying. I don't
                    know why they decided that nobody from the embassy besides the charg� or the
                    ambassador should be involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, essentially there wasn't a team out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Not a team that involved cooperation of the CIA or the military who
                    were actually fighting. We had a very good relationship with the military's, the
                    side of the military house that was doing cooperation. Military cooperation,
                    building up trying to build up the new Afghan national army, trying to provide
                    military assistance and in other ways. We had at least the political section had
                    very little to almost no relationship to the people who were fighting the war.
                    I'm not sure to what extent the ambassador did for the charg�. I know they went
                    out to briefings would receive briefings, but the briefings were I would say not
                    very good. We had a great many military people and CIA people who were assigned
                    to Afghanistan like State people who had never been there before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like all of a sudden there was a lot of
                        publicity about soldiers and CIA people with global position equipment on
                        horseback and all, but you know and I know, going through the Vietnam
                        experience, it sounds great, but you don't give somebody a couple of weeks
                        training and plunk him down into a situation and really get very much out of
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0287" n="Page0287"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They didn't as far as I could see get very much training at all. We
                    certainly got no training to go there. The training for Afghanistan was shameful
                    I'd say for everybody concerned. There was none. When the Department called me
                    and we started to talk about my going to Kabul very early in December before the
                    embassy actually opened I told them that I was free and that I would just as
                    soon join the group that was in training at NFATC. I had this look of just
                    amusement from the person I said that to and he said, “What group in training?”
                    I said, “Well, you're opening up an embassy. It's even been announced in the
                    newspapers. It's been announced at press briefings. You're getting people
                    together from the Department. The place has been closed to us since 1989. I
                    assume you have people, a core group of people now in training at NFATC.” He
                    said, “No, we have nobody and there won't be anybody.” He said, “We're just
                    picking people at random and sending them there.” That was the State Department
                    planning for opening up the new embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's important to understand, it sounds like the
                        CIA again, it sounds like it was kind of doing almost the same thing of
                        throwing people in or you know, I mean, maybe all right is helping direct
                        fire or something like that, but I mean did they seem to have a cadre of
                        people who knew what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, not at all. Well, when I think of knowing what one is doing I think
                    of people who are regionally aware who have a smattering at least of the
                    language and know something about the culture, the history, the morays of the
                    country who know where they are, who can sort of blend in to what they are
                    doing, who can meet people, make friends, establish relationships with people.
                    Using those criteria, no, the CIA was a zero. They were very good about passing
                    out big bags of money, new SUVs and wonderful little satellite radios to people,
                    but as far as any real knowledge of what was happening, where they were, what
                    they were trying to get done, the past, the present, the future, was zero.</p>
                <p>Q: In our previous set of interviews, we've talked about your experience in Iran,
                    Peace Corps, Kabul, Tehran, prison and all that. You've gained a great deal of
                    experience in this area. How much of this was transferable both in language, but
                    also in society and the way things operated in Afghanistan?</p>
                <pb facs="0288" n="Page0288"/>
                <p>METRINKO: An incredible amount of it. Being in Afghanistan in the year 2002 and
                    the year 2003 was very much like in fact incredibly like being in the Peace
                    Corps in Iran in 1970. I would say that there's that many years between Iran and
                    Afghanistan, 35, whatever, 34. The way people acted was the way the villagers
                    around my Peace Corps site acted. Especially in Iraq, the language that I spoke
                    was [different] from Iran. The foods that we ate were extremely similar, the way
                    we sat, what we talked about, the interests of the people, they way they acted,
                    the way they dressed, everything was very much like Iran, not Iran of today, but
                    the Iran that I knew in 1970. Part of that is because so many Afghans had been
                    to Iran, a couple of million who had gone there have lived there have come back,
                    but part of its also due to the general sharing they have of culture and of
                    language and of history. My own experience, I never, from the first moment that
                    I arrived in Afghanistan I felt that I was thoroughly familiar with my
                    surroundings. I knew how to act, what to do. I knew what was likely under the
                    counters and the stalls and the bazaar. I could recognize the goods. I knew what
                    everything was used for. The patterns, the music, the art, everything was
                    extremely, extremely like Iran. Now, in the entire time 2002 and 2003 that I was
                    in Afghanistan, no Afghan ever asked me if I was an American without exception
                    they would always ask me, they would assume I was from Iran and they would ask
                    me from what city I was from in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you tell them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I would laugh and I would tell them I was an American and on several
                    occasions I was told I was lying. Number one, an Afghan teenager told me I
                    should be proud to be an Iranian and why was I trying to conceal it. When I went
                    to buy material in the bazaar once for my Afghan clothing the shopkeeper that I
                    was dealing with kept asking me what city I was from in Iran. I kept telling him
                    that I was an American, that I wasn't Iranian and he looked at me because I
                    always spoke [Farsi], I never spoke English on the streets. He looked at me and
                    he said, “I've lived in Iran for ten years. I know you're an Iranian. What city
                    are you from?” I finally said, Tabriz. He said, “Oh, well, why didn't you say
                    so?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you said for Afghan clothing, what was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Afghan clothing is very similar to Pakistani village clothing. It's a
                    long, well, very wide baggy pants which are cinched with a rope or a drawstring
                    and cotton of course and a tunic that goes over that. Now there are differences
                    in quality, there are differences in style. If you're in Herat and you're an
                    older person you wear only white. If you're in [other] areas you wear very dark
                    colors, dark green, dark brown, dark black. If you're younger in other areas,
                    they have a very large amount of embroidery on the front. So, I have all kinds
                    of these costumes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, were you getting this to fade into the thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0289" n="Page0289"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I was getting it because it was comfortable if I went out to
                    someone's home. Everyone sat on the floor and you can't sit on the floor with a
                    pair of tight pants on or jeans on. It's far more comfortable to dress Afghan
                    style. Also, I had a long beard. I carried prayer beads. Nobody would notice me
                    on the street when I walked like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What about, what were you getting from your contacts
                        going out to dinner and all? How did they see things developing at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Everybody wanted change immediately. It wasn't going to happen
                    immediately. Everyone talked about how evil the warlords were and how America
                    had to get rid of the warlords. That also was not going to happen because we had
                    several different policies about the warlords. But I say everyone; the people
                    who were my contacts were a limited group of people. I had a number of younger
                    Afghans who had always been in Afghanistan that I met through the embassy or as
                    I start going out and meeting religious figures or other people. I started to
                    see a large number of tribal elders who were coming to the embassy on a daily
                    basis because they thought they were supposed to. We were the new power in the
                    country; therefore, they were coming up to introduce themselves to the new
                    power. I would get called to the gate whenever one of these groups came and I
                    would bring at least a sampling of them into the embassy to small meeting rooms
                    that we had down by the main gate and sit and talk with them. I'd say that my
                    contacts were non-existent. I knew some women of course, but I don't know what
                    the women of the country were thinking. I do not know what villages were
                    thinking at the time unless they were talking to us in the embassy.</p>
                <p>It's a bit hard to explain. It was still rather chaotic out in the countryside
                    and there was no network of information or communication or transportation. When
                    you think of a bowl of spaghetti, you think of a bowl of spaghetti that's all
                    been chopped up. You might think you had a strand and you would discover it was
                    only an inch long and it wasn't a strand. So many of the Afghans were in the
                    same boat, however because the new government was coming in from abroad. Some of
                    them had been in America, had been living in other countries, they'd been in
                    Pakistan, they'd been in [Iran]. They were coming in to take high government
                    positions. A lot of the younger guys in the place, the gophers, the ones who
                    were running around doing speeches, etc. were coming in bright and fresh from
                    England and the United States. They didn't know anything about Afghanistan. I
                    mean they could speak [Pashtu] or [Dari] because they had learned it at home,
                    but they really didn't know anything about the country and they were perhaps
                    less prepared for it than many of our military and CIA people were.</p>
                <p>There were very few, I never met anyone I don't think with the possible exception
                    of a few top leaders to whom other people came and gave constant reports. I
                    never met anyone who seemed to have a grasp on the whole country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0290" n="Page0290"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you, were people looking over their shoulder for
                        insurgents or the Taliban at that time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: They didn't need the Taliban, they had themselves. We've met the enemy
                    and the enemy is us. There wasn't so much talk about a resurgence of the Taliban
                    at the time. The Taliban were there. The government bureaucracies did not
                    disappear. The police had not all disappeared. The schools had not all
                    disappeared. Various ministries had not disappeared during the Taliban area. The
                    people stayed and the guys simply cut their beards when we came in. It's amazing
                    how peoples have a wide tolerance for stupidity at the top of their leadership,
                    but in general much of the bureaucracy, much of the commercial, cultural, social
                    life of the country did not change when we came and the Taliban left. Much of
                    what we call Taliban activity was really tribal or it was rivalry or it was old
                    feuding. I'd had this explained to me over and over and over again by tribal
                    elders, you know, the old men who had come in with their long white beards and
                    would sit and talk for an hour or two. They would laugh about some of the things
                    that were happening. What they always said was you American soldiers don't
                    understand this, but you know, what they think is a Taliban act is really a feud
                    going back more than 100 years in that particular family. I have to agree with
                    that. I would say that even today much of what we call Taliban is not, it's
                    simply, commercial rivalries, land grabs, power grabs, power struggles or ethnic
                    problems using Taliban. When you say was there a fear of Taliban resurgence, no.
                    It was more a fear of, it was not a fear, it was just a fact, the warlords,
                    generals, high officials, other rich people, people who had power at the local
                    [level] and the landwards were trying to grab what they could in this great
                    realigning of property.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Our first charg� was Bryan Crocker. Bryan Crocker has been described as
                    the most self-contained person in the Foreign Service. He shares no information
                    and he doesn't really ask questions. He falls into that category of officer who
                    believes they know what is happening and they do not need either counseling
                    advice or expertise. That having been said we certainly traveled quite a bit
                    together. We went to meetings together. I did reports, which he would routinely
                    sign off on. The entire time I was there I never once knew if he thought my work
                    was good, bad or indifferent. Then again, nor did anyone else, which is fine.
                    It's just, not a criticism; it's just a statement.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Just the way he operated. The ambassador was a different story. The
                    ambassador was Robert Finn. Finn came in I think around April I want to say if
                    I'm not mistaken and Finn came in with a very good background of the general
                    region. He had already been ambassador in Tajikistan. He spoke Tajik. He was a
                    serious language scholar. His Turkish was excellent. He was bilingual in Turkish
                    and English and he and I had known each other since we were in the Peace Corps
                    together in Turkey back in the '60s. The relationship there was I'd say quite a
                    bit better. He had a very good sense of humor. He liked to sit and talk about
                    things, which made a big difference.</p>
                <p>Now, having said that, we had other ambassadors as well. He had the president's
                    special envoy who came back and forth and back and forth sometimes for a couple
                    of days, sometimes for a couple of weeks. He shared with no one. He I don't even
                    think shared very much with the ambassador. He was also an ambassador with that
                    title and he was carrying out his own sort of relationship with the Afghan
                    government. I remember the very first meeting that I mentioned when I'd been
                    there for two days [with] myself, Bryan Crocker, and the head of AID sitting in
                    [an] office for a couple of hours. Right after we'd been there for about an hour
                    talking about development plans and AID's assistance program for Afghanistan a
                    man came in with a note and he gave it to [Bryan]. He looked at it and said,
                    “Excuse me, gentlemen, I have an important call that I have to take. I'll be
                    back quickly.” He came back about 20 minutes later and all he said was, “That
                    was [the] ambassador from Washington.” He sat down to continue the conversation.
                    He never told us what [the ambassador] had said. There was that. I don't think
                    our ambassadors talked to each all that much. I would include General McNeil in
                    that. General McNeil was the head of the American military forces in the
                    country. He had his own relationship with the government. The head of the CIA
                    there had his/her own relationship with the government. Later on well into the
                    year 2002, Ambassador Bill _____ came out to handle assistance programs. I
                    believe, I've been told that his relationship with Finn was far, far better, was
                    very good, very close and they worked together quite well. He was also there
                    with the title of ambassador. We had [a] political advisor to General McNeil and
                    to the military. He also had the title of ambassador on his business cards. So,
                    we had in Kabul itself three permanent civilian ambassadors, plus one visiting
                    special envoy who came out constantly and was always on the phone when he wasn't
                    out there, plus a military general who really had all the toys in the game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the general and what was his relation do you
                        think to the embassy and his political advice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0292" n="Page0292"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't know. When I was there the first year they would come to
                    meetings, but not all that often. There was a defense attache's office of
                    counselor in the embassy, which also did not seem to have very much to do with
                    the actual military combat forces of the country. They were supposed to be a
                    liaison. We had the office of military cooperation in the embassy, which also
                    did not really; it was not really part of the active combat operations going on.
                    How the defense attache's office, the office of military cooperation and the
                    physical fighting army there cooperated, you'd have to address that to them I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got an army fighting in essentially a civilian
                        area. Did you feel that the army that was going out in the field was
                        sensitive to being and understood the ocean in which it was dealing or the
                        area it was dealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I'd say the answer is a flat no. Even many of the military people
                    assigned to Kabul itself in the office of military cooperation and certainly
                    many of the paramilitary assigned to the CIA in Kabul seemed to have no clue
                    about what or how ridiculous they looked and acted on the streets. The standard
                    gear, now, we were slowly, quite steadily, slowly, but steadily getting into law
                    and order of a sort in Kabul and there was a very strong attempt by the
                    [central] government backed up by the embassy to show that things were returning
                    to normal, the people were dressing in normal clothes, that they weren't going
                    to carry weapons in the country nor in the city. In fact weapons were banned in
                    the city of Kabul unless you happened to be an American soldier or one of the
                    international soldiers. The American military, especially the paramilitary
                    associated with the CIA went around looking like a combination of soldier of
                    fortune and Fredericks of Hollywood in this sort of weird military getup with
                    lots of leather things and extra holsters and bandoleras and places to put guns
                    and knives and bandanas and neck scarves, weird shirts. They looked like they
                    had come out of a Rambo movie and they sort of loved doing this. So, if you went
                    into a normal restaurant, there weren't that many decent restaurants in the
                    beginning, but if you went to a normal one for lunch or dinner and happened to
                    be seated in the same room as a group of these guys it became ludicrous after a
                    while. They were covered with weapons. Covered with strange gear, none of it
                    standard military gear and it looked like a while bunch of Rambos sitting there.
                    They had no sensitivity, no sense of, they acted like they were, they had
                    conquered Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the station chief and the
                        ambassador, how they got along and how supportive things were between the
                        two or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I think there was a good relationship there as far as I could see. Very
                    friendly, social and professional, but again, that's something to address to
                    those guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed at the embassy during most of this time, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0293" n="Page0293"/>
                <p>METRINKO: During the first time I was there, yes. I lived at the embassy except
                    for a two-week period when, let me qualify that. I left the embassy to go to
                    other places in the country several times. The first time was with the charg� on
                    a one-day trip to. In June I took a sort of leave of absence from the embassy
                    for about ten days or two weeks and I was seconded to the United Nations
                    organization assistance agency for Afghanistan and went off as an election
                    observer. This was absolutely great. I used to wander around myself usually with
                    an FSN in Kabul. I could get away with that. Number one, nobody knew what I was
                    doing. Number two, I was often out as the consular officer as opposed to the
                    political officer and I would take the consular FSN with me. So, I could
                    disappear and sort of come back several hours later. I guess the DS people
                    decided that I knew what I was doing on the streets, but this was the first time
                    my trip with the UN that I was really and truly off on my own. The UN provided
                    what they called the UN security blanket. DS accepted this. As it turned out
                    when I arrived in [Herat], the UN security blanket was about 150 miles away and
                    consistent of somebody who would sit at a desk and receive phone calls. This was
                    great. I got to wander all around those two provinces for quite a long period of
                    time with a bunch of Afghans who were also newly employed by the UN to help run
                    elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the election go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, this was the election, it was when they were choosing the
                    representatives from the towns and villages who were going to represent those
                    regions at the regional loya jirga, grand consuls and then from the regional
                    grand consuls they were then going to select a smaller number to go to Kabul for
                    the major grand consul, loya jirga, L-O-Y-A J-I-R-G-A. It went great considering
                    nothing like this had happened in a very, very long time that the entire world
                    was watching it and that nobody knew quite what to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0294" n="Page0294"/>
                <p>To give an idea of how much state work had to be done by the international
                    organizations, my very first day in Kandoz I was out with the regional _____
                    representative who by the way was a former Soviet military officer who had done
                    training for the Soviet troops who invaded Afghanistan and he was retired from
                    the Soviet army. I was talking to. It was the day when in a very small town
                    outside of Kandoz people were gathering together to select representatives to go
                    to the larger counsel down the road. There were at least 1,000 people, maybe
                    more, you know, milling around a big field, going into groups and back and forth
                    and up and down and it was taking them forever. The UN man had explained
                    everything. Other people had tried to explain what they were supposed to do, but
                    there was still a lot of chaos. It was a combination of ethnic groups as well.
                    There were Kajiks there, there were Turkmen there and there were Uzbeks there.
                    This was an area where there was a mixture. Of course there were no women there.
                    One of the men started to talk to me and he said, “We're having a problem doing
                    this because this is the first time in more than 15 or 20 years when we've been
                    able to get together in a group.” I looked at him and said, “What do you mean?”
                    He said, “Well, you couldn't form a group under the Soviets and it was too
                    dangerous under the Taliban as well. If too many people were in a group they
                    would get arrested. So, we don't know how to talk to each other in a big group.”
                    Something as simple as that. Lord knows it would have been much harder if there
                    had been women there to talk to them, too. Although that happened in a [cases].
                    I did several of these. I spent time in Kandoz. I went up to the town of Nahrin
                    where there had been a major earthquake earlier that year.</p>
                <p>Driving over the mountains in northern Afghanistan now, everything was dirt of
                    course, driving over the mountains with a rickety old SUV and coming down,
                    literally driving on mountain slopes. There was no real road because people
                    don't use vehicles that much. They use horses or donkeys. There was a kind of
                    track that we called it and coming down off the mountains, it was a plateau
                    surrounded by high mountains. I looked around and thought that it was the most
                    beautiful place I had ever seen in my life. It looked like Shangri-La, that's
                    all I could think of. It was late spring. The grass on the plateau was deep
                    green. There were a million small poppies out and the plain was extremely as
                    flat as a table and it went for miles and miles and you could see herds of
                    horses in the distance and incredible birds of bright plumage. It was just so
                    beautiful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned poppies. What was the situation drug
                        wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0295" n="Page0295"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The situation drug wise. Well, in theory the Taliban stopped the
                    cultivation of poppies or at least they stopped most people from cultivating
                    poppies so I believe they could just concentrate a little bit of the poppy
                    production in their own hands. In the two years that it's been independent,
                    Afghanistan has turned into the world's second largest producer of poppies or
                    opium. It's an amazing accomplishment aided and abided by all sorts of people.
                    Everybody grows poppies. All the major landlords, all the major warlords, major
                    government officials, police officials, military commanders, everybody is
                    involved in it. Everyone makes excuses for the Afghan farmers as well. The
                    excuse is going along these lines: if [a farmer] tries to raise corn or wheat he
                    would only make $400 a year and its backbreaking work and if he just turns his
                    fields over to poppy cultivation he could make $5,000. It's true. If I go into a
                    jewelry store and grab a bunch of jewelry I can make a lot more money than I'm
                    doing right now, but I also know that it's illegal. Afghans don't care. The
                    concept of law that we have, the rule of law, is simply an alien concept there.
                    If it's something to their advantage, they simply ignore the morality and the
                    illegality of it. The government ignores it. The military ignores it. They tend
                    to aid and abide it in general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there was the opium penetrating
                        particularly the youth, which seems to be a problem, you know. First it
                        seems only benign, you sell it to those stupid Europeans and Americans, but
                        then it starts to enter your own culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That's an interesting question. Now in the entire time that I was
                    there, how many months? Seven plus six, 13 months that I lived in Afghanistan
                    going out constantly being in villages and small towns, living whatever passes
                    for a normal life I never once saw opium used, not once. I was told over and
                    over that Afghans do not use it. They sell it, they deal with it, they package
                    it, they produce it, they, you know, raise it, they do whatever you want to do
                    with it, but they don't use it. That having been said, if I compare, I've
                    compared Afghanistan of the year 2002 to 2003 to Iran in the year 1970. In Iran
                    in 1970 I knew lots of people who used opium and it was used fairly routinely,
                    socially, in all classes, villages, all the way up to the top level of society.
                    I never once saw it being used or even smelled it being used and I can tell the
                    smell. I know that one. The only time I saw something like that used was when I
                    had taken over the two DEA guys, the new head of the marine corps security
                    detachment and the new head of the, the new RSO from the embassy to meet the
                    northern alliance commanders who have the northern alliance army base right
                    across the street from the embassy. As we were all sitting on the ground just
                    sort of chatting the commander lit up a hash cigarette and one of his deputies
                    did, too and they offered them to us. I thought it was great watching the DEA
                    people and the marines sort of sniffing and pretending they weren't there. That
                    was the only time and that was just whatever, probably just hash. It certainly
                    wasn't opium.</p>
                <pb facs="0296" n="Page0296"/>
                <p>Let me say this, too. I was in Afghanistan in 1970 and I saw it used then. I
                    could smell it. I watched people using it. I mean Afghanistan was on the drug
                    trail in 1970. It was no longer the silk trail or the spice trail. It was the
                    drug trail. I saw nothing like that in 2002 2003. I did see fields that were
                    under cultivation and I saw certainly in village houses stacks of opium plants
                    and it was used as thatch sometimes on sheds and out buildings, the stocks with
                    the pods. Only the one time and one man out of hundreds and hundreds of hours,
                    thousands of hours of my being with Afghans did I see somebody actually using it
                    and that was hash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about do you remember you told me off make or not,
                        I'll make sure it gets on here, about visitors from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Visitors from Washington were extremely concerned about this. Everyone
                    from congress and we had at least half of the congress out there the first year
                    I was there. Everyone from congress brought it up immediately. It was important
                    to them. It was for us up until later on in the year of 2002 it was a bit of a
                    moot point because we simply couldn't get anywhere. We didn't know what was
                    happening. We had indications. We had reports that it was being grown, but we
                    sure couldn't get out there to see it. It was not part of the U.S. military
                    mission to wipe it out. Perhaps it should have been, but it wasn't. For visitors
                    it was very high on the agenda.</p>
                <p>I remember once early on when a congressional group was out there and we were
                    giving the normal country team briefing and since I was the political officer at
                    the time and the economic officer and in theory also, there was no one else
                    there to do it, responsible for tracking drug production, they were asking
                    questions about it, you know, why aren't we doing more. I looked at the
                    congressman and I said, “Congressman, we don't have a functioning toilet here in
                    the embassy yet. I share one with about 100 other men. How far do you want me to
                    go trying to eradicate the poppy production on the other side of the country?”
                    It was just, the first year it was I'd say impossible. Now, the British got
                    excised about it or exercised about it and they came into the program to pass
                    out large sums of money to people who would then promise to destroy the opium.
                    Afghans like most other people are quite willing to accept large sums of money
                    and promise anything knowing that you will go away. The British would come and
                    hand out sums of money and the Afghans would say yes, yes, yes, we're going to
                    burn it right now and the Brits would leave. They would then get two sources of
                    income from the same crop, like the Iranians and like others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of handing out money, obviously it's no secret
                        that this is how the CIA gets many of its support and informers and all
                        this. Did you find yourself being warned off by the CIA, you know, you're
                        seeing Genghis Khan or something like that and all of a sudden he's one of
                        their sources.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0297" n="Page0297"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I'd say just the opposite. Very much the opposite. Several times I
                    was asked if I would meet with particularly people that they were interested in
                    because if they said we can't support them financially anymore, but this person
                    is worthwhile maintaining a relationship with. It happened several times. That
                    was one. The other thing is the way it worked, it's no secret that, I mean
                    people, everyone in the city knows where the CIA headquarters in Kabul was. In
                    fact, it was brought home to me very quickly once. I had mentioned before
                    standing at the main gate. We had no communications with the city, very few with
                    government leaders. There was no phone system in the country. People who wanted
                    to see us would simply show up at the embassy and they would give their names or
                    pass a note in to the heavy contingent of marines at the main gate who were
                    there working with the local translators or just local new staff, security
                    staff. I would be called down constantly to the main gate because it was a
                    political group. We had. Do you know what an F hawk is?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, it's protection. The marines had a very, very good force
                    protection unit assigned to the embassy a couple of whom were linguists. I mean
                    they spoke decent Persian and these were marine Intel officers whose job was to
                    do Intel work to protect the marine presence in the city. This de facto meant
                    protecting the embassy because the marines were the embassy. We were all part of
                    the same unit. One of their guys would stand down at the gate, too and their job
                    was to sift through who was coming through the gate to see what direction they
                    should be sent in. They developed a real knack for it. We had lines of people
                    showing up. People who wanted jobs, people who wanted to bring in stingers,
                    people who wanted to give us information, people who wanted to rat on their next
                    door neighbor, people who wanted compensation for having lost property during
                    our attack, people who were looking for their relatives who we had put in prison
                    or people who were just curious who wanted to see the embassy. Also, people who
                    were coming in from the provinces and knew they were supposed to pay a courtesy
                    call on the embassy because we were the new power brokers of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0298" n="Page0298"/>
                <p>The main gate was a gate. It was a big iron gate that opened into a driveway. All
                    the vehicles came in that way. There was a small passenger entrance as well.
                    There was a lead to sort of jerry rigged little security box there along with a
                    larger area that was sandbagged. Afghans would come to the main gate. They would
                    be turned over immediately if they needed something or wanted something to the
                    marine who was doing Intel work. He would determine if they should be set aside
                    to be dealt with by the CIA or if it was a matter for my office and me or if it
                    was something they should be doing. I found the criteria; I found their
                    selection process pretty good. They would call me when there was somebody they
                    knew I would find interesting whether because it was an official who just wanted
                    to pay a courtesy call or because it was somebody who wasn't really CIA
                    material, but we often traded these people back and forth. I would sometimes get
                    called to see if I would meet with the person, for example, call directly by an
                    Afghan or an emissary of the person. I met a large number of high-ranking
                    Afghans because they sent emissaries in. I would determine for example if it
                    came up that the real reason for the meeting was because they had stingers or
                    some sort of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say stingers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The stinger rockets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we were trying to bring them in having supplied them
                        during the war with the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We were trying to buy them. Well, if it was that, then I would turn the
                    person over pretty quickly to the marines, who would then turn them over to the
                    CIA. It just depended on what the reason for the person's being there was and
                    again, sometimes the CIA would realize that the person was really a straight
                    political contact and they didn't want to deal with this so they would turn him
                    over to me. But we did, it was sort of like a meat market down there and we
                    traded meat back and forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like you to talk about Paul Wolfowitz coming out and

                <pb facs="0299" n="Page0299"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The incident was the bombing in early July by the United States of a
                    wedding party in the village of Dehrawod, D-E-H-R-A-W-O-D. There was reason to
                    believe that former Taliban officials were going to be gathering or at least
                    present at a wedding in Dehrawod. There was a military operation going on in the
                    area. The military believed that one of their planes was being shot at by the
                    people who had collected for the wedding so they called in an air strike. The
                    wedding party or the wedding area was bombed. This happened I think probably on
                    July 1st or so. It happened and we found out about it by late that day because
                    the whole [place] was bombed and the wedding party happened to be good friends
                    and supporters of President [Karzai] in fact. It was his staunchest supporter in
                    the area, the person who had helped him had supported him, who had stayed with
                    him actually when he was fighting against the Taliban. This thing Afghanistan
                    was a dearth of information. It was decided to send a team up immediately to
                    investigate what had happened. A team to go up on the ground. The team was going
                    to consist of special forces, a team of ministry of interior and other Afghan
                    officials including the minister of tribal affairs because familiar with the
                    area and myself as sort of a liaison or bridge between the military team and the
                    Afghan officials. We found out about this, this was all decided late one evening
                    and we were supposed to stage at the airport the next morning at 7:00. The
                    Afghans were there early. I was there early. Special forces showed up several
                    hours late because they couldn't get their helicopters in the air to come from
                    about a 15 minute ride to the VIP section of the airport. They arrived very late
                    with apologies. They had had mechanical difficulties and we flew from Kabul
                    Airport to the town of Tarin Kowt. We were supposed to stage in Tarin Kowt and
                    go up over land from there to _____. A decision was made by the special forces
                    person that he needed more support and so we called in; he called in support for
                    more special forces to come up. They had to drive up. The military U.S. military
                    team, paramilitary team I should say that was at Tarin Kowt did not support us
                    in this. They did not want to go to Dehrawod at all and so they had no vehicles
                    or any other way to help us get up there I believe because they had been part of
                    the actual military operation two days before and did not want to return. The
                    military team arrived very late. It took them far longer to get there, to get to
                    Tarin Kowt than they'd thought and they arrived the next morning. Our departure
                    was delayed and delayed and delayed. We finally departed and because we took the
                    wrong road since no one had brought any guides ended up going up streambeds,
                    riverbeds, etc. It took about six hours or so to get to our destination as
                    opposed to the two hour drive it was supposed to be over what turned out to be a
                    good road we found out.</p>
                <p>We arrived, did the investigation which because of our very nature had to be
                    cursory. None of us were trained investigators; we could look for things
                    logically. I could look around at the sight and try and determine and try and
                    see what it looked like compared to a normal Afghan house, whether this indeed
                    was the way a wedding would have taken place, things like that. We stayed
                    overnight in Dehrawod and then the next day. You know, I don't know if we stayed
                    one night or two nights. We stayed two nights I believe because, yes, it would
                    have been two nights that we stayed there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, very strangely. In the village of course people were extremely
                    angry, very emotional. They were extremely quiet, silent, but we had enough
                    high-ranking Afghans with us, ministers and generals, etc. and we also had a lot
                    of firepower with us. We had about 25 special forces guys with big weapons. They
                    showed us the site, took us around and showed us where people had died. The
                    bombs had hit the side of the, had hit the wedding party where the women and
                    children were, not the men. I might add that no weapons were ever found that
                    might have been shooting at the airplane. Also, well, it's like the
                    investigation with the investigation, but we stayed for one night at least,
                    possibly two nights, my mind is blank on this already in Dehrawod at the
                    government guesthouse. It was two nights. It was two nights that we stayed
                    there. I stayed one night sleeping in the guest house which was a large compound
                    with the military and the next night I went and stayed with the minister and the
                    other Afghans at the home of a local official which was far more comfortable. We
                    were received emotionally, but not with over hostility. People were very angry.
                    A great many women and children had died they believed and said.</p>
                <p>I did one of the strangest things I've ever had to do in my Foreign Service
                    career at least. The second day we were there when the governor, the general who
                    was with him, the Afghan general who was a deputy minister of the interior and
                    the minister of tribal affairs. The local clergy decided to call everyone
                    together, all the men of the town and area together to have a large prayer
                    service in the mosque. None of my military companions would come to this. I
                    represented the United States government at this ceremony, which had about 1,000
                    armed men sitting. I sat against the wall of the mosque in the front under where
                    the preachers stand with a couple of the other officials. The commander of the
                    special forces unit did come. He sat in a different place out of the crowd
                    really. I was the one who sat up front and I was the one pointed to as the
                    representative of the American government. It was not easy because everyone of
                    them was heavily armed. Normally they don't carry weapons to the mosque, but
                    they did this time. Then again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and your military colleagues convinced that this
                        was what it was portrayed as a wedding party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0301" n="Page0301"/>
                <p>METRINKO: To this day I do not know what happened there. What I saw was a total
                    absence of blood. There was no blood at all anywhere. A couple of specks, a
                    couple of drops here and there. We walked through a large double compound. We
                    walked up on the roads. There were lots of holes from probably bullets, but no
                    indication of how long the holes had been there. This of course is a big mud
                    wall compound, adobe mud compound. When I asked about blood I was told that it
                    had, they had destroyed all the bedding, all the quilts, all of the mats, the
                    carpets that the blood had seeped into. They finally brought one sort of quilt
                    out to us to show us that was all slashed up, but there was no blood on it. The
                    problem I have with it is that I did not see any indication myself that blood
                    had actually been spilled there. That having been said the clinic insisted that
                    a large number of people had been brought in wounded, hurt and others had died.
                    People who had been wounded were actually seen in Qandahar by military
                    representatives who went down to the hospital in Qandahar. We were shown places
                    where people were buried, but we did not exhume any of the graves to see how
                    long the bodies had been there. I guess what's important is that the people
                    there believed this had happened. They came in one after the other to report to
                    the minister and his staff the names of the people who were killed, wounded,
                    their identifications, etc., daughter of so and so, sister of so and so. When we
                    left they had a whole long list of names of the killed and the dead and the
                    wounded with full identifications. I don't think Afghans would lie about that,
                    but I'm not sure. I don't think so many people would lie about it. I guess I
                    came away from there feeling that yes, indeed something had happened, a lot of
                    people had died, been injured, but a slight hesitation in my mind, did it really
                    happen in the place that we were looking at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the military side of the investigation? How did
                        they feel about it? I mean were they going in to essentially to justify the
                        military action or were they going in to take a look?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The guys who went in there as part of the investigation team and it
                    really wasn't an investigation team, not really. They weren't trained police;
                    they were just guys in uniform. None of them had been part of the operation so
                    we all went in pretty open-minded. Our conclusions I guess because we hesitated.
                    The Afghans were adamant that this had happened and when we came back two days
                    later we went straight from the airport to give a briefing. It was quite clear
                    then that the Afghan team believed that this had happened. These were the people
                    who had died, these names, this number of people. The Americans were more
                    hesitant. Something had happened, but we could not describe it in detail. What
                    happened was that some time after this Wolfowitz came in on one of his quick
                    little jaunts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Wolfowitz, the assistant or deputy or under secretary
                        of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0302" n="Page0302"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes. I gave the regular political briefing during the country team
                    presentation to him, but then the ambassador said that I had also been the
                    officer who had gone with the military team to Dehrawod and I gave a description
                    of what we had done up there. He got angry, quite angry and his comment was,
                    “You sound like you believe the Afghans that this actually happened.” I said,
                    “Well, I'm just giving you the evidence. We did an investigation. Our conclusion
                    was that something had happened, but we weren't trained police investigators.”
                    He wanted to dismiss the whole thing as though it was a figment of the Afghan
                    imagination. In fact I understand that when he came back to Washington he
                    complained that the political officer there was touting the Afghan line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there after how many months, about, the first
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The first time I went there it was supposed to be for one or two months
                    max. It ended up being seven. My first break was actually to accompany a CODEL
                    up to Tashkent for one nights, two nights in Tashkent. It was great. It was the
                    first time I was out of Afghanistan. I'd been in Afghanistan for about four
                    months. I finally got my own bathroom, my own bed in a room that was not shared
                    with anyone else because we slept dormitory style in the hallways and in the
                    meeting rooms in the embassy. I came back from Tashkent because I was going to
                    be staying on until August. The State Department decided to give me a break, an
                    R&amp;R and I took two weeks off and spent about ten days in the United States
                    and four days traveling. I came back and left again in August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I left in August with an onward assignment as the WAE to go to Yemen to
                    take over the consular section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Yemen then from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I was in Yemen from October of 2002 until January of 2003.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When to when now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: October 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0303" n="Page0303"/>
                <p>METRINKO: To January 2003, four months. No, actually, I'm sorry, I got there in
                    September, it would have been September. I can double check on the dates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's all right. What was the situation in Aden at
                        that time? Were you in Aden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, I was in Sanaa at the consular section of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How different did you find that from Aden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Very, very different. In Aden I had spent all my time surrounded by
                    guys with guns, surrounded by security forces of my own as the head and
                    principal of an operation although it was only a ceremonial title. In Sanaa I
                    was part of an embassy team in a very well run, well directed embassy which had
                    all the functions of a normal diplomatic institution and I had real work to do
                    all day long and sometimes very late at night. Interesting work and an
                    interesting place. I was also able to go out without security most of the time.
                    I also had my own apartment to live in and that was a semblance of a normal
                    life. Friends, dinners, social life, going to the embassy in the morning,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, first of all who was the ambassador
                        while you were there or was there one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The ambassador was Edmund Hull, H-U-L-L.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Edmund Hull is one of the Department's best Arabists. He spent Peace
                    Corps and much of his career in the Arab world. He is an absolutely fluent
                    speaker. His wife happens to be Palestinian from Jerusalem. You could not have
                    found a better person to be ambassador in Yemen. He was, I mean absolutely
                    perfectly prepared and was going a very good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consular wise what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Consularwise, well, Yemen has a large American Yemeni population to
                    begin with, probably about 40,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I helped add to that back in the 1950s when I was in
                        Dhahran. I was sending Yemenis to New York and Youngstown, Ohio.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0304" n="Page0304"/>
                <p>METRINKO: You may have sent the families of the ones we've picked up and locked
                    away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember they used to come straggling in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, the guys who went there in the '50s are now back in Yemen and
                    they're very rich and they have built huge chateau houses and they have big SUVs
                    and their wives have lots of gold jewelry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You better explain, you used the term SUVs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, sport utility vehicle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a large almost a pickup truck with a fancy chassis on
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, exactly, it's like a big Jeep, a big fancy Jeep. The preferred
                    mode of transportation for anybody with money in much of the undeveloped world
                    because you can drive them over dirt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were their wives I mean what were their wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, you know, the Yemeni American community was very large and it had
                    money that had been made in the United States often at things like running
                    supermarkets, gas stations, commercial life of all sorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was doing it we were sending them off to work in
                        the mills.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: The mills and the car factories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but that had ceased. I mean the places had ceased.
                        They'd moved on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0305" n="Page0305"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They had moved on. There was a Yemeni American community, which meant
                    there was a great deal of immigration and visa work. There was a great deal of
                    registration of American babies, reports of birth, less reports of death, only
                    occasionally if they had to give [permits to] work to the United States. Because
                    of the number of young children, the number of young women and men who had
                    become American citizens based on their parents having been in America, there
                    was a lot of ongoing immigration work. It was considered something that would
                    add to your value as a bride if you could guarantee the green card to your
                    groom; it upped your price considerably. We had that. We had almost no standard
                    tourism work. I mean Yemenis simply had been banned from going to the United
                    States by us. I was there at a time when all of the new regulations were in
                    effect about either stopping or so rigorously proceeding with Arab visa
                    applications that it was impossible for an Arab male to get a visa to go to
                    America. Unfortunately, many of these procedures had been put into effect that
                    summer which meant that all of the students who had returned to Yemen. The
                    Yemeni students who were studying in the United States could return to Yemen for
                    the summer got stuck and could not return to school in the United States. This
                    was a problem that every diplomatic post in a Muslim country was facing all
                    around that region of the world and it was a major foreign relations problem. We
                    were not giving routine visas to anybody. If you wanted a tourist visa you had
                    to be a real VIP or somehow get yourself an aid referral or be referred to a
                    truant officer of the embassy to the consular section. We did have those.
                    Basically it was a very restrained or constrained visa operation.</p>
                <p>NIV was very brisk. We had a steady stream, you know, several a day of NIV work,
                    non-immigrant visa and a lot of American citizen work. We also had a very active
                    warden system. When I was there indeed we had a terrorist attack on the American
                    hospital and three Americans were killed. This was in January of the year 2003.
                    The hospital of Jibla, J-I-B-L-A.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did it did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It was done by one man who was very familiar with the hospital. His
                    wife had been a patient there. It was a missionary hospital. The three people he
                    killed were two elderly, I mean, an elderly nurse, an elderly doctor and an
                    elderly office worker, all of whom had been there for many, many years and
                    devoted their lives to the hospital, maintaining it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the motivation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0306" n="Page0306"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The trial was just over recently and I haven't seen the results of the
                    trial. I didn't really follow it after I left, but the motivation, my
                    understanding of it was the Americans were doing too well. They were
                    missionaries indeed in a very, very radically Muslim area. They were sort of
                    placid missionaries. If somebody asked them a question about Christianity they
                    would respond. If they were asked for books they would give, but they would not
                    prosthesis actively. The person who did this was what we now call a Muslim
                    fanatic. I'm not sure if it's a good term, but that's what the newspapers use.
                    He did he said because he thought they were having too much of an impact on the
                    community. These were people who spent their time doing good works. They were
                    out volunteering. They were out visiting the prisons; visiting the poor, giving
                    free medical assistance to all sorts of people in the town and apparently
                    bearing witness if you will in the Christian sense. This guy did not like
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the reaction within the Yemeni
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: A lot of reaction. I had been in that town two days before just by
                    chance. I had passed through. I had visited an American prisoner there. We had
                    six or seven prisoners in the country, American Yemeni prisoners. I had done my
                    prison visit. I left and I came back to Sanaa and arrived back in the evening
                    and the next morning I received a call from the hospital from one of the doctors
                    who was crying. He said they had just been attacked and people had been killed.
                    The reaction in the community was I would say extremely outgoing for the
                    Americans. These Americans were very well known. The officials in the community
                    were aghast. The head of the prison for example, in the town told me the next
                    day that, the killer was captured immediately. He was captured that same day. He
                    was well known. The people knew who he was. He walked in and they just thought
                    he was doing regular business in the hospital with the hospital staff when he
                    walked in. The warden of the prison told me they could not even put him in the
                    regular prison when they captured him because one of the doctors, a woman, had
                    been the prison doctor and she had volunteered at the prison once a week and was
                    the one who would talk to all the prisoners. She spoke very good Arabic
                    apparently. She would carry messages to their wives. She would take messages to
                    their kids, bring letters back and forth, etc. She was sort of regarded as a
                    mother by the entire prison population of the city. The warden said that if we
                    bring the guy here, the killer here, the other prisoners will kill him. Now,
                    that having been said, I'm not sure that was how other Yemeni in this
                    establishment and others feel about it, I have no way of knowing.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feel for a growing or maybe it was an established fanaticism
                    within the, this Muslim area against the United States? I mean, you know, I
                    mean, well, this is so much has been happening and we are tagged with supporting
                    Israel and attacking the Palestinians and all that. Did you get any feel?</p>
                <pb facs="0307" n="Page0307"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Let me distinguish between Afghanistan and Yemen. In Afghanistan the
                    entire time I was there both times, both in Herat and in Kabul the year before I
                    do not recall any Afghan ever bringing up the subject of Israel or the
                    Palestinians. The average Afghan doesn't like Arabs, doesn't give a damn what
                    happens to them and because they had so little access to the news they don't
                    really know much about- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I remember a charg� coming back once from a meeting and saying one of the best
                    things about being in Afghanistan is that you don't have to worry about getting
                    beaten up on the Palestinian issue every time you saw an official. Nobody ever
                    mentioned it, they didn't care. I think they disliked, they disliked Arabs so
                    intensely that if they thought about the Palestinian issue they were kind of
                    good. They had no love for Israel either and basically didn't know anything
                    about them. I mean this is Asia. It's not the Middle East. It was far away from
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Iraq play a lot, a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, it did, but it didn't. There was one statement attributed to the
                    governor of Herat who had been, a speech he was giving at one of the local
                    mosques said that the American invasion of Iraq was the same as the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan. Maybe he said it; it was attributed to him, but not
                    clear. The top clergyman, the top mullah, in Herat looked at me when I asked him
                    about Iraq and he said, “We have never forgotten that Saddam Hussein applauded
                    the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and he supported it.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, I think the chief Afghan reaction to our invasion of Iraq was
                    that oh my God they're going to spend money there, they could be spending here
                    instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's one of the political. I mean they're right. It is a
                        matter of concern. How about in Yemen? We're talking about fanaticism and
                        anti-Americanism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yemen is very, very different. Number one it's the home ground of Osama
                    Bin Laden. His family is from Yemen originally. His father was Yemeni, not
                    Saudi. Yemen borders Saudi Arabia. Yemenis are always in Mecca. They're in
                    places like that. They're not particularly pro-Palestinian. No one is, but Yemen
                    if you'll recall was one of the few countries that openly supported Saddam
                    Hussein during our first war with him. In fact, they supported his invasion of
                    Kuwait and they paid dearly for that support because when that war was over
                    Kuwait and Saudi Arabia simply ceased giving any assistance to Yemen. So, they
                    paid big time for their support. They learned a lesson then.</p>
                <pb facs="0308" n="Page0308"/>
                <p>Yemen has a far more conservative approach to religion. Afghans and Yemenis are
                    both religious - at least in outward appearance they're both religious - but I
                    never felt uncomfortable for a moment with any Afghan [mullah] I met. They were
                    always hospitable and pleasant. I didn't meet more than one or two Yemeni
                    [mullahs] and they happened to be American Yemenis. In Afghanistan it was very
                    easy to go into a mosque and if you were old you could walk into them. I knew
                    religious leaders. I knew religious teachers. I saw them all the time. In Yemen
                    this simply wasn't done. I don't think that the embassy has any relationship
                    with the Yemeni religious hierarchy that I know of. It's possible the political
                    section did, but we sure did not in the consular section. As opposed to
                    Afghanistan where I had good relations all the time with Afghan religious
                    personnel or people. I never myself was subjected to any sort of pressure or
                    problem because of our support for Israel in Yemen. I was met unfailingly with
                    hospitality and friendliness by Yemenis. On the other hand I don't speak Arabic,
                    so I don't know what was being said, you know, behind my back, but in Yemen I
                    got out a great deal. I went to homes, Yemeni homes for dinners and I left the
                    city many times to go off on visits to see my prisoners, to visit the American
                    communities in various places and the subject was never brought up with me
                    really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Yemeni Americans? How were they, what
                        were they up to in Yemen and were they a problem or not for the Yemenis or
                        the Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No, just the opposite. They were building big houses. They were buying
                    big cars. They were putting up satellite dishes. They had very beautiful houses.
                    I mean, you know, regular little palaces. They were investing in agriculture.
                    There were tractors, things like that. They were opening up businesses and it
                    was considered very much, very desirable to go to America to get involved with
                    one of these families that you could get the money to go to America yourself.
                    Whether or not any of them support Al Qaeda, etc. I have no idea. The ones that
                    I met were friendly and hospitable to me. It's a rather strange thing. It's a
                    town in Yemen called Al Qaeda. That's the name of it. I passed through it at
                    least ten or 20 times on my various visits. It's about six hours from Sanaa.
                    It's funny: the sign at the beginning of the town, “Welcome to Al Qaeda,” at
                    both ends of the town, went up after the attack on the towers. There was no
                    problem with it; it's just that so many people wanted to stand to get their
                    photographs taken under the sign. These were mostly the foreigners which I
                    actually have my photograph. Luckily I remembered not to send the film into the
                    United States to get developed. I had it developed locally because I don't know
                    what would have happened if I had sent film in, you know, given the
                    psychologically in America right now and someone had seen me standing with a gun
                    and I had a scarf around my head under a sign that said Al Qaeda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to my experiences when I was in Belgrade and
                        particularly in Macedonia with Yugoslav Macedonians often went to the United
                        States and then they would come back and get themselves a bride. Do you have
                        a line on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0309" n="Page0309"/>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, big time, yes. In fact, it was sort of standard. You have by
                    now the second and third generations, often the third generations in the United
                    States. People go back and forth all the time. It's sort of like this constant
                    coming and going and sifting of people. Cousins, brothers, uncles, aunts,
                    grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, your daughter, your son are back and forth. Now, the
                    American Yemenis who have not been to Yemen are sent back in their late teens to
                    sort of get to know the place, to spend a year or so with grandma and grandpa or
                    an aunt or an uncle, and very often to pick up a bride or a husband. So, we had
                    a fair number of young American girls who were Yemeni by background coming back
                    to marry guys who spoke no English and we had a fair number of young guys from
                    New Jersey and California who were coming back and had just married a
                    non-English speaking bride from the family village. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's kind of fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: It's kind of fun and they're very often very nice, interesting people.
                    I met a lot of nice people that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You mentioned these Yemeni Americans in jail. What
                        did they get in jail for and how were they treated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yemeni jails are not unpleasant, not particularly. In fact, how many
                    did I visit? I visited four different Yemeni jails. Everybody was in jail
                    because of a homicide. Often homicide involving either honor or land. Now, in
                    one case for example, well, an automobile problem involving a death afterwards
                    where the guys got out and had a fight and somebody opened up fire. A fight over
                    land with an uncle and somebody getting killed. People get put into jail and
                    there is a death penalty in Yemen. Somehow or other my predecessors in Yemen had
                    forgotten to pay attention to the prisoners. They simply had stopped visiting
                    and they had stopped keeping records. I've always felt particularly sensitive to
                    knowing about prisoners. It's an important, that's why the Foreign Service is
                    [there], after all.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0310" n="Page0310"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The first thing I did when I arrived there was to ask for a list and
                    then get it checked. The FSN in charge of this had just come newly to the job.
                    He'd only been there for a month or so. He didn't know he was supposed to have
                    been doing this. The officers who had been there had simply not done it
                    apparently. We discovered that one American had been executed and nobody even
                    knew for example. Others were out of jail and others were in jail, but we got it
                    all sorted out. Basically they were American men or American guys who had come
                    there at least in four cases, American guys who had come to Yemen on these long
                    visits and had not understood how far you could or could not go. Yemenis who
                    grew up in Yemen know the parameters of behavior. The American guys would come
                    from California or New Jersey and on arrival at the airport be presented with
                    their own Uzi or their own G-3 automatic or semi-automatic and a dagger and a
                    belt to wear. Unfortunately they didn't know when and how to use this stuff. So
                    I had at least four American young guys because of that sort of dumb, stupid,
                    nice guys, a little bit of testosterone back home, back in Yemen for the first
                    time with too much money, probably reacting to the reaction of Yemeni guys to
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about blood feuds? I've that heard in Afghanistan you
                        don't want to get involved with a blood feud, which we can talk about later,
                        but what about in Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, there are. Yemen has been a fairly stable society for a very long
                    time. Yemeni society is still as feudal as Afghanistan is. It's tribal, feudal,
                    with little remote villages and people who carry individualism to a real large
                    extent living in towers. It's there. I don't know enough about it to go farther
                    than to say that it's there, but certainly fighting over land is common. Two of
                    my young Americans were in prison because they had gotten involved in a fight
                    involving land claims.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you run into the problem of Yemeni American guys or just Yemenis gone to
                    the United States, married an American girl, brought her back to meet the folks,
                    had a baby and then she couldn't get out? It certainly was a problem in Saudi
                    Arabia and it continues to be and Iran and Iraq.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: The Yemenis have the same sorts of laws that the other countries do
                    about women not being allowed to travel without parental permission or without
                    spousal permission. In my time there we had a couple of cases that seemed to be
                    developing in that way, but they never really developed full-time. In other
                    words, women who came in and would complain about the way their husbands were
                    treating them, but nothing really definite in my time there. We could counsel
                    them, we could give them advice, we could tell them the law and that was about
                    it. No one who ever actually said, “I have to get out of here and I want to take
                    my kid with me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about while you were in Yemen did you, how were
                        communications with consular affairs and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0311" n="Page0311"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Right now, I mean it's good because everyone has e-mail now. In fact
                    all of my officers communicated routinely everyday on their own with their
                    counterparts back in the Department. I did with people in CA. Communications I'd
                    say are excellent now as opposed to pre-e-mail. Now, you have to know who to
                    communicate with. We had good communications. We answered congressionals that
                    way. Most of our congressionals would never have been seen by the ambassador and
                    the DCM. We answered them routinely by e-mail because that's how things are
                    done. It's all e-mail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, I mean, you're still a creature of the older
                        Foreign Service and all, did you find this instant communication a good
                        thing or a nuisance or how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, in general a good thing. You have access now to a great deal of
                    expertise that we never had. In the old days everything would have had to come
                    through the boss who would have then have gotten it through the DCM or through
                    the ambassador even to ask routine questions of the Department. Now you don't
                    have to bother with that. In fact, much of the routine work I didn't have to
                    bother with at all. I could point my officers in the right direction and I could
                    often say, really you ought to ask someone about this in the Department.</p>
                <p>To give you an example, because of the changes in visa processing for Arab males
                    were having to wait forever and ever for the FBI and the CIA and the State
                    Department to clear applicants. Even after they were interviewed their names
                    would be sent in and it would take several weeks or several months to get a
                    response from the Department on individual cases. You could work around that by
                    dealing directly by e-mail with the agencies concerned or the Department saying
                    these six cases are okay. They have time until next semester. This one has a
                    week to go and you could have five, ten, 20 e-mails back and forth to get it
                    straightened out. Without ever, no one in the sort of upper floor of the embassy
                    ever even knowing this was happening. Certainly I did that, my officers did
                    that, trying to get things straightened out like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, one of the things one always learned as a
                        consular officer even back in my time was try to keep the ambassador and DCM
                        and all out of it because they don't know what you're doing and they're too
                        used to getting clearances and puzzling over it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0312" n="Page0312"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Or trying to set you off in a different direction. I would say you
                    know, this embassy was a real exception. The ambassador was excellent. The DCM
                    was excellent. Of course I attended staff meetings all the time. The ambassador
                    was also a personal friend, which makes a big difference. The DCM was one of, I
                    think one of the best DCMs I've ever see, Alan Mizenheimer, I think really,
                    really good. He did not have a strong background in consular affairs, but he
                    knew that he had to understand it. He did a very, very good job. We had every
                    week like clockwork he was down in the section for an hour meeting or an hour
                    and a half meeting on consular issues. He would say things, I would say things
                    and this was, we're going to have this meeting no matter what's happening and we
                    did every week. Plus access immediately whenever I needed it or whenever he
                    needed it for an exception. We worked very carefully with visa referrals, he and
                    I to keep the ambassador's name out of things for example. You don't want your
                    ambassador talking about visas with people at cocktail parties. So, the
                    ambassador and he both knew whenever a visa question came up they would give
                    somebody my card or my name and phone number and ask them to call me and that's
                    how I got it. This worked and they were professional. Very, very professional.
                    They also knew the area so well that it made a big difference, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about almost, well, the
                        understandable clamp down on Muslim young men getting visas because you
                        know, to me a name check sounds, names can be dillied with and a short
                        interview is not going to. You know, you say, are you a terrorist and
                        normally the answer would be no no matter what they are. I mean I'm not
                        quite sure what this, how this would work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Clamping down on travel by Muslim men to the United States and
                    especially on education travel, coming here to study is one of the stupidest
                    things the American foreign policy and security establishments have ever done.
                    The reasoning is simple. The leadership in Afghanistan today are friendly to the
                    United States and open to American officials because they have all studied or
                    lived in the United States. This goes on and on and on country after country
                    I've been in. People make friends, they marry here, often they have wives here
                    and then they go back to their own country and take a position and become very
                    useful both in helping us and explaining us to their colleagues. What we have
                    done is ensured that our successes ten years from and 15 years from now will not
                    have that. That when they go in to see an official in Yemen or in Saudi Arabia
                    or in Indonesia or Malaysia or wherever, 15 years down the road that that person
                    will be somewhat hostile from the beginning because that person either got
                    screwed financially by us or lost his chances of an education in the United
                    States. The people who come to the United States in general to get educated here
                    are people with a little bit of money and a little bit of standing already.</p>
                <pb facs="0313" n="Page0313"/>
                <p>I remember one report from our embassy in Indonesia was that the visa problem,
                    the visas for children of VIPs, members of the parliament, etc., was the major
                    foreign policy issue that the embassy was facing because so many hundreds of
                    them had gone back to Indonesia for the summer and the change had come [before
                    they returned]. I was dealing with very, very well placed VIP students who could
                    not come back to America and who lost either their semester or the rest of their
                    education in the United States. I could think of several cases of that where
                    fathers were highly placed officials and they also lost things like their down
                    payments on their apartments or their... They lost thousands of dollars and it
                    just went on like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem is anyone knowing anything about the business,
                        the screening really doesn't, it is so I mean it's hard to think that the
                        screening can do anything or if it does it can be taken care. I mean if
                        there is something to it and if you put the name in and it's various ways.
                        It either will turn something up right away or it won't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, I've also, I've always felt this way that if somebody was really
                    coming from an organization who was going to do an act of terrorism against the
                    United States especially now they wouldn't use their own name. They would have a
                    pseudonym or they would be using a passport belonging to someone else and there
                    would be no way to find this out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mike I think this is probably a good place to stop
                        and we'll pick this up the next time when you're going to what happened I
                        mean after you left Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I left Yemen and had a month in the United States and was off to
                    Afghanistan again where I was sent in March of 2003 to be the political advisor
                    at an army outpost, a U.S. army outpost in the city of Herat in western
                    Afghanistan. I spent six months there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well that's what we'll talk about. You said
                        there were two things I should ask you about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: One is the problem of civilian compensation for damage and injuries and
                    deaths suffered in the American attack on Afghanistan. The other is the question
                    of prisoners of war or prisoners taken by U.S. military and the CIA and the way
                    they are treated.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <pb facs="0314" n="Page0314"/>
                <p>Today is the 21st of October, 2003. Mike, before we move on to Herat, let's talk
                    about Afghan civilian compensation for war damages and prisoners of war.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: I wanted to bring this up because it sort of fell into a combination of
                    the political and the consular field and covered duties of mine in both those
                    offices. When we attacked Afghanistan to drive out the Taliban and to try and
                    locate Osama Bin Laden we damaged a considerable number of buildings destroyed
                    private homes, the homes of people who were in no way involved with the
                    government or with any effort to attack the United States. We also killed a fair
                    number of Afghan civilians. We destroyed a number of businesses. In Afghanistan
                    there is no insurance if your home is destroyed. There's no such thing as life
                    insurance. There's no such thing as medical insurance especially at that time
                    these things did not exist. This meant that if we destroyed a civilian residence
                    the chances of the family being able to rebuild a house were exactly zero.
                    People built houses over the course of a generation. Very few people had the
                    money or the resources to simply build some place to live in.</p>
                <p>The best example of this that I can give is a meeting that I had with the head of
                    the police academy early on in my first stay there in February of 2002. I had
                    taken the representative from the State Department from I&amp;L over to meet the
                    head of the police academy. We were discussing police programs, police policies,
                    etc. This was clearly an important person. He was a very pleasant, very sort of
                    cooperative officer, one of the old breed of police officers who were coming out
                    of the woodwork and taking up their positions again. When our first meeting was
                    finished he asked me if he could speak about a person problem and I said of
                    course. He said, “I sent a letter to the embassy when it reopened in December
                    about three months ago, but I've never had a reply. Did during the American
                    attack on Afghanistan a bomb hit my brother's house? My brother and his wife and
                    several of their children, his wife's sister and his wife's father were killed.
                    A couple of the children survived. I'm now taking care of them. I'm responsible
                    for them, but the house was demolished in this attack. Will the U.S. government
                    ever pay any sort of compensation? These children are now my responsibility, but
                    they have no income, they have no resources, they have nothing left because
                    everything was destroyed when the bomb hit the house.” I asked him for a copy of
                    the letter that he had sent to the embassy. I took the letter and presented it
                    once again to the Defense Department, the representatives at the embassy. All of
                    those letters were basically going into a black hole.</p>
                <pb facs="0315" n="Page0315"/>
                <p>Later on in the spring we had a large demonstration at the embassy in front of
                    the compound of people who had lost family members or their homes or their
                    businesses in the American attacks. They were asking about compensation. It
                    wasn't a violent one, but it did take about an hour and a half or two hours to
                    talk to the people and to dispel the crowd. This problem kept surfacing over and
                    over again. We would get letters sent to us by the new Afghan government that
                    had been forward to them by various people. There weren't a lot, but there was a
                    steady trickle and looking at the problem I realized that by spending just a
                    couple of million dollars because housing costs were cheap at that point, it was
                    the property that was expensive, not the houses, spending a couple of million
                    dollars, compensating people for a lost bread winner, a lost caretaker, a child,
                    whatever or agreeing to pay medical expenses for people who had been injured by
                    the American attacks. We could have gained an incredible immeasurable amount of
                    good will from the people. The military stopped that. They refused to consider
                    it. They said they didn't want to set a precedent for a future war or past war.
                    My argument was that they could simply declare this something that was unique
                    for the case, an exception, not a precedent, but to the best of my knowledge
                    nothing has ever been done. The result is that we created quite quickly a class
                    of enemies to the United States when we didn't have to. Granted they had been
                    killed in conflict. It was not necessarily their conflict. They were civilians.
                    They were innocent and we could have taken care of the problem quickly,
                    precisely and to the credit of the United States. Instead there will always be a
                    few thousand people who will say that the Americans killed their mother, their
                    father, their sister and their brother, their daughter, their son.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the lawyers take over. The lawyers are all
                        powerful and they have no concept of the repercussions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: If I started to give my opinion of the lawyers in the State Department
                    and the Department of Defense, this would be an x-rated oral history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. POWs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: POWs, well, are they POWs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0316" n="Page0316"/>
                <p>METRINKO: The Defense Department, the White House, refused to consider Afghans
                    who were arrested by us as POWs. The standard operating procedure was to capture
                    people, to take them not to notify anyone that they had been captured and to
                    simply imprison them, whether it was a dark room at Qandahar or sending them out
                    to Guantanamo in Cuba. Families were not notified. Families had no access. I had
                    a constant round of visitors usually tribal elders, groups coming in from
                    villages and towns, coming to the embassy to ask how they could find out about
                    their son, their brother, their uncle, the village school teacher who had been
                    arrested by the Americans. I worked out a sort of arrangement with the
                    International Red Cross that was in Afghanistan because they did have access
                    although they had very limited access. They weren't happy with their access. In
                    fact they were very unhappy with it and they were routinely not notified by the
                    Department of Defense when people were being moved from one prison to another
                    taken out of the country or changed. There were very good reasons to believe
                    that we were mistreating prisoners. In fact, during one Red Cross visit to a
                    prison they saw two Americans and quite clearly Americans escorting someone who
                    had a hood on his head and the Americans identified themselves as CIA. Then sort
                    of caught themselves and whisked the man with the hood on out of the way and
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>I think that probably the stories the prisoners are telling now, the ones who are
                    being released from Guantanamo have a great deal of bearing in truth. Granted it
                    was a violent time and we were trying to locate people who might have ill will
                    towards the United States, might be planning an attack on the United States, but
                    what we have done is basically tossed out the principles that the Red Cross
                    supports and that we used to support. The problem with this is metafold. Number
                    one it goes against what we think of as the American way of life and our
                    principles. But number two and I go back to my time as a consular officer, I
                    routinely visit or have visited American prisoners in foreign jails. We were not
                    allowing the families, the lawyers or the legal representatives or the embassies
                    of people who were captured by us to be visited, to visit their prisons. It
                    makes it very difficult for me or another consular officer to go to a prison in
                    Yemen in Saudi Arabia, wherever and say I demand to see my American citizen
                    prisoner. We have thrown out that entire principle. That was one of the
                    principles of which the Foreign Service, the State Department is founded. Access
                    to prisoners in time of war. We've allowed the Defense Department to simply toss
                    that away and I think it's going to have pretty serious consequences down the
                    road. We have certainly lost a huge amount of good will in the Red Cross and the
                    international community and much of it I think was probably due to our own
                    incompetence. Many of the people were probably not really serious prisoners.
                    They were picked up. They could have been dropped off just as easily. It was
                    because there was a lack of confidence within the interrogators as to whether or
                    not they should let someone go. It was a lack of original awareness. It was also
                    a lack of language skill. It's going to have consequences all down the road.
                    Talk about creating enemies. The combination of not paying compensation for
                    damage that we caused and then simply imprisoning people and not letting their
                    mothers, fathers, etc., husbands and wives see them or know about their status.
                    That has created a huge amount of ill will in many, many thousands of people and
                    it seems to be to me purposeless.</p>

                        to a chance encounter I had this morning. As I was walking to an interview,
                        I met an old colleague of mine, Liz Raspolic, who was with Peace Corps and
                        then served with me in Seoul. She was also ambassador to an African country.
                        I mentioned I was going to interview you again and she said she understood,
                        this is sort of corridor gossip, that you got kind of crosswise with the
                        bureau in South Asian Affairs. From what you've been telling me, you are not
                        a bland person.</hi>

                        people who are calling things are seeing things from a different perspective
                        and are maybe more attuned to the culture. Was there anything to this? Did
                        you get any feel that you weren't a team player or something?</hi>

                <p>METRINKO: No, not particularly. In fact, when Ambassador Finn talked to me about
                    Wolfowitz, he laughed because he said he had been part of the complaint, too. He
                    had been complained about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so this may have just been something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, the Herat thing. How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0318" n="Page0318"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I had talked to the embassy before I left about the possibility of my
                    coming back and being one of the representatives at a PRT, a provincial
                    reconstruction, I forgot what the T stands for. Reconstruction Center, yes, PRT.
                    These were now, a PRT, the concept of it has changed over time. It's changed
                    since day one. It was supposed to be and is supposed to be a combined military
                    civilian contingent living out in the provinces in smaller towns, smaller cities
                    that would provide an island of security, help the NGOs and the IOs coordinate
                    their assistance and development efforts and also help extend the hand of the
                    central government into the provinces to show that the central government was
                    indeed helping to develop and assist, helping to reconstruct buildings, do
                    public works projects, etc. The concept of it was fine on paper. The reality of
                    it is something a little bit different. I'd give it a score of probably a solid
                    80, not a failing score, but not a tremendously successful score either. One
                    problem was that despite the Defense Department's wishes for the American
                    military to coordinate NGO activity, the NGOs had none of this. They were having
                    none of it. In fact they didn't even want to associate with anyone who was
                    carrying a weapon or wearing a uniform. They wanted the soldiers to wear
                    uniforms and to stay out of their way and to stay out of their activities and to
                    sort of not be there. In fact there were a couple of confrontations between
                    NGOs, IOs and American military because of this absolute different concept of
                    the military role and the NGO role in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>In general, in theory rather, the central government out of Kabul will eventually
                    have representatives on these PRTs. In theory there will be AID representatives.
                    In theory there will be a State Department representative to do political work
                    and in theory they will be otherwise staffed by civil affairs, people from the
                    U.S. army who are well versed and trained in providing development and
                    assistance work in conflict areas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sure sounds like CORDS from Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I know. I kept saying CORDS, but I was the only one of my generation
                    there so nobody else knew what I was talking about. It sounds like CORDS. We all
                    know how successful CORDS was. Nothing like basing an idea on a previous
                    failure. Having said that, originally I think the United States wanted these to
                    be concentrated in American hands but very quickly came to the conclusion that
                    other countries had to take part, too. Number one they were becoming very
                    expensive and number two we wanted to show this was a multi-national effort, not
                    just an American effort. Now, that was the philosophy of them. The reality of
                    them is rather different. There are parts of Afghanistan that don't want to have
                    any development or assistance from the West. It has nothing to do with Taliban
                    or Al Qaeda or anything like that. It's just that they don't want Westerners
                    there. The tribal areas don't want us mucking about telling them to educate
                    their women or to build schools or to build this or to build that. They simply
                    don't want anyone there doing that. Afghans are throughout their history have
                    been a bit xenophobic. That's fine, they don't want it in certain areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0319" n="Page0319"/>
                <p>There are other areas like Herat where they wanted the money from us. They wanted
                    us to rebuild the buildings, but they really would have preferred that we do it
                    long distance and send a check. They didn't much want an armed U.S. presence in
                    Herat province, at least the governor there didn't want it, the local government
                    didn't want it. I'm not sure what the people of the city wanted. I think maybe
                    they probably didn't much care one way or the other, but certainly the governor
                    did not want the Americans there, any sort of military force.</p>
                <p>Other problems stem from our ability to staff such an organization. For example,
                    I saw two different teams of soldiers come and go. One was there when I arrived
                    in March. They left in approximately July. The next team that came in was there
                    for a month and a half when I was there. The problem with the teams was that
                    they were good people, they were all nice people, but they were all reservists
                    who had very little or no experience at all in assistance or sort of development
                    projects. The coordination they did with the NGOs was minimal because the NGOs
                    didn't want to talk to them because they were in uniform carrying weapons. The
                    projects that they did were supposed to be quick impact, but quick impact had
                    already passed its time. You do quick impact in your first month. By the time I
                    was there a year had passed or more, a year and some months had passed since our
                    arrival in Afghanistan. I saw for example school buildings that we had put up,
                    we had paid for, had had constructed that by the second year were already in a
                    state of collapse because they were so poorly built. I saw a whole series of
                    projects that AID had done without coordinating them in any way with the
                    military in Herat, which were simply sad, sad, pathetic little projects. For
                    example, one teachers training college, a large building they were putting up on
                    a hillside where the plaster and cement work was so bad that if you just sort of
                    slapped the wall chunks would fall out of it. They were continuing to construct
                    this with very shoddy base materials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the problem, lack of supervision or just the
                        Afghan construction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Lack of supervision. No, you could do beautiful buildings in
                    Afghanistan. They have mosques and other buildings that have been up for a
                    thousand years there, hundreds and hundreds of years. You can do great stone
                    buildings. I went, the head of education for Herat Province took me out one day
                    and we spent the whole day looking at ongoing projects, things that were being
                    done, both U.S. military projects, AID projects, other NGO and IO projects. He
                    took me to one school that was being put up by one of the NGOs and the place was
                    spectacular. Extraordinarily well built, solid stone, beautiful stone floors,
                    good electricity, good plumbing. The American buildings were basically shells
                    with latrines out in back, with bare wirings hanging from ceilings for lights.
                    We were building sort of ghettos, ghetto buildings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why, I mean, what was behind this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0320" n="Page0320"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Again, it was a matter of timing and the belief that you should do as
                    much as possible with the money that you have as opposed to doing a few things
                    well. I could go on. The city of Herat had money. There was a considerable
                    amount of money coming into Herat from customs fees, from taxes, from other
                    sources and all up and down the street that I lived on, all around the city,
                    incredibly fine homes were being built covered in white marble-stained glass
                    windows with a big courtyard, swimming pools, all sorts of amenities and
                    luxuries in them and yet the same people who were building their beautiful
                    mansions were letting their kids go to school under tents. They simply did not
                    seem to care very much. We could build the schools, but the chances of anyone
                    taking care of them are probably pretty slim. There is just not a concept of
                    responsibility for public buildings that way. I would have said after being
                    there that we should avoid projects in the big cities, move out, let the Afghans
                    do things they can do themselves. If they want school buildings they can put
                    them up themselves instead of building luxury homes. Perhaps we should have been
                    concentrating on major public works projects, for example a highway system to
                    unify the country, to allow communications and transportation around the
                    country, and not wasting time, materials, assets and people doing a whole series
                    of piddling little projects that took up too much time and effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the NGOs. What was your impression of the NGOs?
                        How were they, what they were doing and the relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I came to the conclusion after a few months in Herat that the NGOs were
                    not part of any master plan to develop and assist Afghanistan. The NGOs had come
                    to Afghanistan and each of them had some expertise in some particular form of
                    development. They presented their areas of expertise as what should be done for
                    Afghanistan and because everybody was trying to throw money at Afghanistan they
                    were given lucrative contracts to do what they wanted to do. If you look at a
                    list of projects that we have paid for, the United States government has paid
                    for, in Afghanistan, it looks sort of like...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that it looked like a garden.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0321" n="Page0321"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It was a garden that was just thrown together, bits of it overgrown,
                    flowers here, some dead things there and just a miscellaneous hodgepodge of
                    projects and public works. We spent an inordinate amount of time doing pissant
                    little projects for women, everything from little sewing machines to teaching
                    embroidery classes to paying to have child care done or things that were fine,
                    but not essential at the time. We have been building little tiny schools all
                    around the country, but probably not allowing for them to be maintained down the
                    road, putting buildings up that will not be easy to maintain and they are ghetto
                    buildings already after one year or a couple of months. When I looked at the
                    projects for Herat for example, there were things like helping women plant a
                    women's garden. Well, that's fine, but we're in a major city of that part of the
                    world. You don't have to spend $40,000 or $50,000 helping a group of women plant
                    a little garden. We were paying farmers to clear out the underbrush in a forest
                    area. This is insane. We were paying people money to clean up their own wells.
                    If an Afghan family is not going to take the initiative, make the effort, expend
                    the energy to clean its own well in front of its own house, screw them. This is
                    not something the American taxpayer should be paying for. A great deal of money
                    and time were spent on all these little tiny things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was calling the shots on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: That was the problem. The lack of coordination on development and
                    assistance was beyond [belief]; it was pandemic. I could never even get a
                    cohesive list of what development projects, what assistance projects had been
                    funded in Herat Province by the United States government. It wasn't because
                    there was ill will in the embassy. I don't think the embassy knew. There are a
                    great many different organizations that do funding and in Washington they do not
                    work together. This is a real failure on the part of our central government
                    here. For example, inside the State Department itself you have money that comes
                    from DRL, you have money from INL [Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
                    Enforcement Affairs]], you have money that comes from the Refugee Bureau, you
                    have money that comes out of AID and you have money that comes out of Cultural
                    Affairs. These people don't talk to each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0322" n="Page0322"/>
                <p>The best example I can give is this. I was out with a combination of special
                    forces and civil affairs people in a town about a day's travel away from Herat.
                    We had gone out there to spend a couple of days basically looking out over the
                    town and doing some site reports about it. The morning that we were departed we
                    had all of our SUVs, these sport utility vehicles, lined up on the road outside
                    the town for a final check and two SUVs pulled up alongside. Out of one of them
                    steps what was clearly an American. He looked American, he sounded American, he
                    was carrying some sort of semi-automatic weapon in his hands and he had a
                    revolver on a belt. He was wearing U.S. army sort of camouflage pants and he had
                    a polo shirt on and a baseball cap. In unmistakably American English he said,
                    “Hey, you guys American?” I said, “Yes, we're American. Who are you?” He said,
                    “I'm the State Department representative here.” My reaction was, “Excuse me?” He
                    said, “Yeah, I'm with the Department of State in Washington and I'm up here
                    doing some projects.” I said, “Really?” The head of the military team was
                    looking at me and looking at him and I said, “Which office in State?” He said,
                    “With the embassy in Kabul.” I said, “Really, I thought I was the Department of
                    State representative in this part of Afghanistan. What exactly are you doing?”
                    It turns out he was a former special forces guy who had retired and gotten a job
                    with a private company that had a contract with INL.</p>
                <p>His company had a contract with them to put a radio network in for the Afghan
                    national police. They were putting it in all the provincial centers so that the
                    police could talk to one another. Now, he had two SUVs and I think they had
                    diplomatic plates on them. He had another American with him, also armed. He had
                    an escort of Afghan police including the one of the provincial police's top
                    ranking people. Then he told me he had spent the day before with the governor of
                    Herat at a meeting. Now, he was doing a project, U.S. taxpayer money, funded by
                    the Department of State, great. I asked him how the had gotten the cars. Did he
                    drive all the way from Kabul because you're a long way from Kabul, maybe 500
                    miles? He said, “No, we had a C-130 drop us off yesterday. They brought in the
                    cars for us and they dropped us off yesterday morning and then we met with this
                    [group] and then we came up here.” I looked at the army guys who were with me
                    and they said, “Do you mean a C-130 arrived at the airport yesterday?” “Yeah.”
                    Well, as it turned out he did have a project that he was working on. I went
                    back, I was seething about this, so was the army because the army commander who
                    was with me was the commander for the whole area and he didn't know a C-130 had
                    arrived the day before at the airport that he was responsible for. We go back to
                    our team house and I sent off an e-mail asking the DCM and the head of the
                    political section and Bill Taylor, who was the head of development assistance at
                    the embassy, what's going on, who are these people? They're armed and they're
                    introducing themselves as Department of State. I don't like this. Are they
                    Department of State? Who are they? The head of the political section came back
                    and said I have no idea. It's the first time I'm hearing anything about this.
                    The DCM answered a day later. He said, I have to check; this might be an INL
                    project. But it was like nobody had bothered to coordinate it inside the
                    embassy. Nobody had bothered to coordinate it with the Department of State
                    representative there and it was basically a display of incompetence and
                    stupidity on the part of the State Department, this lack of coordination.</p>
                <pb facs="0323" n="Page0323"/>
                <p>Now, that having been said, I'd had a meeting just the week before with the head
                    of police for the whole province, on which I had sent in a report that was
                    distributed inside the embassy. He had talked about the problems with
                    communication with other police facilities. They had the report and yet it never
                    occurred to anyone to think that maybe they should tell me there was a project
                    like this going on that my taxes were paying for. This was one example of what
                    was happening all the time there. I was really angry about that. Fine, I could
                    understand how it could happen.</p>
                <p>Not long afterwards an AID officer who was responsible for projects out in the
                    provinces was in Herat on one of her periodic site visits. She had been there
                    for a couple of days. She was staying with us. I was invited out by a newspaper
                    reporter who had just come in and wanted to have coffee with me at the United
                    Nations guesthouse. I went over to the guesthouse and we were sitting there
                    having coffee and an American guy walked up and introduced himself and said that
                    he was there working with AID. I looked at him and said, “You're here with AID?”
                    He said, “Yeah.” He handed me a card and indeed it was an AID business card. I
                    said, “What are you doing here?” He said, “I work with the Ministry of Finance.
                    I'm here as one of the inspectors and an advisor to the ministry of finance.
                    I've been here for a couple of months now. You know, I stopped over at your
                    house before you arrived and I just said hello to people about two or three
                    months ago. I should have gotten back, but I never did.” Well, here we have
                    somebody from AID living with the United Nations number one, which is contrary
                    to all of the security restrictions that we had. That's fine, I won't even get
                    into that part of it. I went back and told the AID person who was staying in our
                    house for a few days. She had no idea. She had no idea who the person was. The
                    AID director in Kabul did not know there was an AID contractor living in Herat
                    and working at the ministry of finance. He apparently went ballistic when he
                    found out. Now, the Ministry of Finance happened to be one of the most sensitive
                    ministries in Herat for all sorts of American policy reasons. We were having a
                    major problem. The central government was having a major problem with the
                    governor of Herat collecting customs and other taxes and refusing to send the
                    money to Kabul. He was keeping all the money for use in Herat by himself. The
                    Ministry of Finance was totally involved in this. Here we had an American AID
                    advisor who was part of this, looking at this, but no one knew he was there. It
                    was just this sort of lack of coordination. Unfortunately it could be seen all
                    up and down the bureaucracy and the structure, the infrastructure of both
                    military and State and development, that we had constructed in Afghanistan. You
                    never knew what the other hand was doing on projects.</p>

                <p>The last example which is really quite funny. The civil affairs team was going to
                    build an office building and school for the administrative women's affairs
                    branch in Herat. This was a great project. The women were studying and working
                    and they were centered in what was a very small, somewhat ramshackle, house,
                    very inadequate and not easy to get to, etc., very inappropriate for school
                    facilities. They were trying to teach women, widows, other women who were
                    breadwinners, skills that they could use out on the market. We had the money for
                    the school. We talked about it up and down. We went through all this with the
                    Ministry of Planning with the Department of Education, with the Ministry of
                    Rural Development and with the Ministry of Women's Affairs. Fine. We submitted
                    (I say we because I thought of myself as part of the army team there) a proposal
                    to the authorities. It was approved by the American authorities after they had
                    vetted it with the central government and then we presented it as a project
                    proposal just as sort of an info to the governor of Herat. He called us into a
                    meeting and he said. He had told the Ministry of Women's Affairs director in
                    Herat that he didn't want it done because another building was already being put
                    up by the American government for that same ministry; why were they doing two?
                    We didn't know what he was talking about. I have to admit that this was a
                    combination of American incompetence combined with an Afghan sort of stupidity.
                    It's a great combination. The head of the Ministry of Women's Affairs knew
                    indeed that AID had also put a project proposal in to do exactly the same sort
                    of building. They were doing it through IOM, the International Office for
                    Migration, the national organization of migration. She hadn't told us this. We'd
                    been talking to her for about two months about a building project. AID and IOM
                    had been talking, but AID had never told us what they were doing and we had
                    never told AID. We only found out when the governor called us in and said he
                    couldn't accept this because it was a waste of money to put up the same building
                    twice in the same place. We had no idea what he was talking about. While we were
                    sitting in her office and she was sort of looking up in the air trying to avoid
                    our questions, the phone rang. Her deputy or one of her office workers went
                    over, answered the phone, turned to her and said, “It's the people from IOM.
                    They want to have a meeting with you so they can bring over the plans for the
                    new building they're doing.” I immediately said, “What? IOM is putting up a
                    building for you?” “Oh, yes, maybe, perhaps.” We left and went over to IOM and
                    found out that IOM, which was the contractor for USAID, was indeed far down the
                    road in planning for this. AID had agreed to it, they had the money, etc. This
                    is the sort of lack of cooperation that we had faced, that all the NGOs, the
                    IOs, the American government and its military civilian hats face there all the
                    time, aided and abetted by Afghan willingness to grab as much money as they can
                    while the grabbing is good.</p>
                <p>You asked about my opinion of the NGOs in general. On a scale of one to ten, a
                    solid five. Neither very good, nor very bad. They were there to do their thing
                    and to get paid well for it. There were some groups that were there because they
                    were Christians who were proselyting in a very sort of quiet manner. I won't
                    even touch that. It's something that I think is counterproductive and it could
                    lead them to get killed like it led my missionaries to get killed
                    [elsewhere].</p>

                    that completely. But on the other hand without them I know [that] much of the
                    school system in Iran would not exist. The best schools in Iran were built by
                    missionaries in the 19th Century. Absolutely fine schools and they continue to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I won't say exactly because I don't think anything is
                        exact, but particularly as you described it, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: What was my job? That's a good question. My job was something that I
                    kind of created for myself. My job was to be the political officer in Herat.
                    This meant four provinces in western Afghanistan because the country was divided
                    up into sectors. My job was to get to know the political leadership in my area,
                    to explain American policy to them, to report back to the embassy on what was
                    happening in the provinces. The military teams that were in Herat and in other
                    sections of the country did indeed do reporting, but their reporting was not
                    analytical. Their reporting, military reporting, is more like a diary. You give
                    long lists of everything you did during the course of the day and you send it up
                    that night and it goes into some vast maelstrom of facts and figures. The
                    problem with the military reporting was that it was just that, it was this huge
                    amount of data, a fair percentage of which was inaccurate or basically simply
                    wrong because they could not speak the language or did not know quite what they
                    were seeing. Much of it was fine, but much of it was also useless. It's also
                    incredibly boring to read because it's just long lists of what we did today.
                    They did give equal prominence to meeting with the governor along with getting
                    bread from the bakery. They don't do analysis; they're not supposed to. It's a
                    different way of looking at things. I was supposed to sit back, think about what
                    was happening, look at the area, look at trends, look at the future, look at the
                    past, talk about what people were saying and thinking and that's what I did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation there? In essence was really the
                        war over and we were reconstructing or was it still a war time situation or
                        how did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't think there's ever been a time in Afghanistan when there wasn't
                    some sort of political violence going on. When you had lulls, when there were no
                    foreign invasions, you had the tribes and families having feuds. That's of
                    course continuing. Is the war over? No. It might have been except that the
                    warlords are playing games. There are a number of political figures, military
                    figures in the country who are trying to carve little bailiwicks for themselves.
                    Afghanistan today is perhaps best compared to early Renaissance Italy or
                    medieval Italy with lots of little mountain cities, lots of villages, lots of
                    little areas controlled by lots of little wardlings and this happens because
                    again there's no way to communicate with the rest of the country. So, the little
                    wardlings, what do you call them, war lords or generals or khans or whatever
                    title you want to use for them, basically have a great deal of political,
                    military and social control over their immediate areas. Sometimes these
                    wardlings band together. Sometimes they fight each other. It has not been a
                    particularly sanguine type of administration for the country. This is what
                    prolonged the civil war. It prolonged the conflict in Afghanistan for at least
                    an extra ten years. This is what led to the destruction of Kabul. It wasn't the
                    Soviets bombing Kabul. It was the stupid little warlords playing their games and
                    trying to destroy each other, all of it for personal gain. I did not see any
                    indication whatsoever that any of the warlords I met had any moral, religious or
                    philosophic fiber to them. These were not people interested in Afghanistan.
                    These were people interested in their own power, lining their own pockets and
                    they were quite prepared to let the country go to hell if it meant that they
                    could become richer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Herat, what were you seeing? Was there a warlord in
                        Herat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0327" n="Page0327"/>
                <p>METRINKO: We had the best of the bad lot, yes. Let me say one thing about Herat
                    first. Herat was perhaps the most peaceful city in Afghanistan. Herat was
                    certainly the most prosperous city in Afghanistan. Herat was only about five
                    hours, no, only about four hours, three and a half, four hours from the Iranian
                    border. It was a fairly decent gravel road that went to the border. All surface
                    transportation. All surface cargo traffic that came out of Europe had to come
                    through Herat to reach Afghanistan. Europe wasn't that far away from Herat. It
                    may sound funny, but you can cross Iran in two days' travel and you're in Turkey
                    and two days across Turkey and then you're in Europe. So, it's close. This was
                    the way that the tourists traveled up until the mid-'70s. There was lots of
                    ground transportation; busses would go to Kabul from Europe. With that having
                    been said, Herat had not had any recent damage. The [Soviets] had not fought
                    over the city the way they had over Kabul. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to
                    find a building in Herat that had been demolished and that still needed
                    renovation. We were looking at one point for a building to reconstruct or
                    remodel as the headquarters for our office. Under the military regulations for
                    assistance, you can renovate or reconstruct something that exists. You cannot
                    build from scratch. You can't build something brand new on new land. You have
                    something that exists and renovate it. When we talked to the governor and the
                    mayor of the city about this, the governor simply laughed and he said, “If you
                    were in any other city in Afghanistan, there would be lots of places. There's
                    nothing in Herat. It's all been rebuilt. We have no buildings like that now.”
                    He's right. He also of course didn't want us in his city so even if he had been
                    wrong he still would have said that. The city was prosperous. Houses in the city
                    could and did cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The homes could be
                    palatial. I saw many homes, many homes in Herat that could very easily be
                    situated on Foxhall Road and would look quite appropriate there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foxhall Road being probably the premiere residential area
                        of Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: There were homes that I would love to be able to look at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where's the money coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0328" n="Page0328"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, that's a good question. There is and was and has been
                    considerable trade between Iraq and the West. There are two sources of money.
                    The first one first. Legitimate trade from Herat that exports carpets. It's a
                    carpet-exporting center for Afghanistan and the carpet bazaar in Herat had
                    hundreds of good carpet shops. They export wool. They would export things like
                    nuts, raisins, dried fruits, agricultural products, lamb, sheep, etc. They also
                    export workers. The people who left Herat during the time of conflict went to
                    Iran in general. In Iran they worked, they didn't sit in camps. They sat in
                    camps, they lived in camps very often, but they also worked. Heratis have been
                    going to Iran to work for from my own experience back in the 1970s, I remember
                    Afghans coming at that point before there was ever a war or simply any kind of
                    problem in Afghanistan. Because they went to Iran they learned even better
                    buildings, trades and they had known that in Afghanistan when they came back
                    they built buildings following the Iranian models. This is why you had beautiful
                    homes, some very beautiful public buildings as well.</p>
                <p>I had to do a just a quick sort of study once for the Bureau of Trade here in the
                    United States where they were questioning an Afghan's request, I'm sorry it was
                    from OPIC, Overseas Insurance Cooperation, O-P-I-C, where an Afghan had
                    requested a loan. He had described his business partner or his sources of supply
                    in Herat and I was asked to go and talk to some of these people and see if it
                    was legit. Well, that's when I discovered that a great deal of people in Herat
                    had partners, I mean they had offices in Dubai and offices in Iran and sometimes
                    in Europe as well. It was all for the export of things like wool, agricultural
                    products and they were doing quite well. The other source of supply. I'd spent
                    an afternoon once with the minister of housing who was visiting Herat. As we
                    were driving around the city I pointed out a street of brand new beautiful homes
                    and I said, “Will you please tell me where people who always say they're making
                    $30 a month are getting the money to do a $300,000 home?” He said, “They're all
                    drug smugglers. The city is famous for it.” Opium. We would get reports about
                    major city officials all the time who were involved in this, major government
                    officials.</p>

                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: We had no problem to do anything about it. Nothing at all. I kind of
                    doubt that the names of people were even being put into the program for
                    visas.</p>

                <p>METRINKO: Oh. I thought they were great. I had a lot of fun with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They must have felt like strangers in a strange land.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: You know, they did, but they adjusted pretty quickly because we had a
                    strange living arrangement. When I got there we had three different houses. Two
                    of them on one street within a block of each other and another one several miles
                    away. The one several miles away was occupied by the special forces. The other
                    two were by civil affairs. We all seemed to get along quite well. Of course
                    there were personality differences based on personalities with different people.
                    Different people with different people and that's fine, you're going to have
                    that in any group. In general it worked out very well. I was the imbedded
                    civilian. The military were not what you'd call. I mean they were professional,
                    but they were also all reservists. They all had lives outside of the military
                    and they understood civilians because they all were civilians or within a month
                    of becoming one or a month or two of having been one. They wore uniforms and
                    basically pretty competent. I had no problem with their military abilities
                    whatsoever. They certainly kept up their skills. They had steady training
                    programs themselves. They went out and did shooting this, that, all sorts of
                    drills outside in one of the closed out military areas for the Afghan army. I'd
                    say enough discipline tempered with common sense that they were not in a
                    military base in the United States. Actually they had to sort of meld into the
                    civilian atmosphere they found themselves in. One thing, when I talked before
                    about the competence of the people who were sent to do public works projects and
                    assistance projects, I would say that the military has a lot of training it has
                    to do for their people because they pull people out of areas where they really
                    did not have training to do engineering work, public works projects and put them
                    into this without really giving them any training. You can't quite do that. We
                    do it all the time in the State Department. We do it in other places, but it's
                    difficult. It's when the military talks about their resources and says they have
                    a million or two million or three million people they can throw into a
                    situation, yes, they have the numbers, but it doesn't mean that those people
                    have the training and the background and the experience to do the job that's
                    required of them. For everyone there it was very much a learn on the job type
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Afghan authorities military, civil at this
                        particular point in time? How did you find dealing with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0330" n="Page0330"/>
                <p>METRINKO: They were at least to our faces universally friendly, pleasant, easy to
                    deal with. I had rather little relationship with the Afghan military authorities
                    there. I knew them, but a very limited, I had just paid some courtesy calls.
                    That was it. I would see them at functions. Our special forces team was
                    responsible for maintaining a relationship with the Afghan military. With other
                    civilian officials in the governor's office, with the ministries, all of the
                    ministries in Kabul had branches in Herat staffed by people from Herat, but
                    selected by the governor of Herat, but approved by the ministries in Kabul. We
                    had very good relationships with the ones we dealt with all the time. The
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs for me, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Planning,
                    Ministry of Women's Affairs, etc. I'd say very cordial relationships to the
                    point where we were also invited out by them. They occasionally would extend
                    personal invitations to their homes or the gardens.</p>
                <p>

                        derogatory, but sort of piddling little things that were being done in order
                        to improve the lot of women which of course had really caught our attention
                        because of the horrible things that the Taliban had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Politically correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Taliban and many of the inherence that might not be
                        Taliban, tribal people, what was your impression of how that was working and
                        what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0331" n="Page0331"/>
                <p>METRINKO: In Herat it probably wasn't happening or working very much, just like
                    it not happening or working very much in the rest of the country. There has
                    never been as far as I know a government or a culture in Afghanistan that
                    believed women were equal to men. Women have been kept under wraps, shrouded for
                    all of modern Afghan history. One of the kings of Afghanistan back in the early
                    1930s lost his position as king because of a photograph of his wife circulated
                    showing her with short sleeves and he was tossed out as king for that. Now this
                    was in the 1930s. To this day even though they pay lip service to the concept of
                    equality, there is no one in the government of Afghanistan who really believes
                    in it. President [Karzai], despite his Western education, the fact that his
                    family lived in America, Europe, etc., the fact that his wife has a very good
                    education, there has never been a photograph of her in the press that I know of
                    and she is never brought out in public. So, no one sees the president's wife, no
                    one sees the wife of any official there. None of the officials of the country
                    believe that women are equal or should have public access no matter what their
                    education might be or their status. When we go in and talk about programs and
                    projects for women, the women who are allowed to take part in this are the
                    widows and sort of the women who have nothing else. The women who have no male
                    protectors or no other way of getting assistance whatsoever. Afghans don't talk
                    about women, they don't joke about women, they never discuss their wives, their
                    mothers, their daughters, unless it's a daughter who is very, very young, like
                    under the age of four. They simply don't. It's just a subject that with a normal
                    Afghan you don't even raise. I've been in places where I've seen thousands of
                    men wandering all over and no women at all, even in the small towns, you don't
                    see women. Now, it's great that we are trying to improve the lot of women there.
                    It's not going to be done by teaching them embroidery or by giving them money to
                    clean up a garden. It will be done over the next generation when the country
                    gets fully exposed to what the rest of the world is. Having said that, women do
                    teach, girls in Herat go to school in huge numbers. There were in, the
                    statistics for the number of students in Herat Province was something like
                    400,000 students in the province almost 50% of whom are girls.</p>
                <p>In the first year of school, the first grade 100,000 students, in the second
                    grade 90,000. The other 200,000 were spaced out from grade three to grade 12.
                    This is because schools have reopened; girls have been allowed to come back.
                    What Afghans have learned I believe from being refugees because there are
                    several million who are refugees is that women have to be educated. This applies
                    to the younger ones, now, the ones who are coming out. What we are looking at is
                    an Afghanistan that will change tremendously in the next several years as more
                    and more girls are educated. Right now what we have is something like a 90% or
                    95% rate of illiteracy for women. The mothers, people whose sisters, aunts and
                    the grandmothers are all behind walls and behind their veils. It's almost like a
                    lost generation. As far as resource allocation is concerned, probably there's
                    not much you can do there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again, how about TV and the Internet and all
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0332" n="Page0332"/>
                <p>METRINKO: It's all changing rapidly. When I got to Afghanistan in January of
                    2002, there was nothing of the above. Television stations starting opening up.
                    The Taliban had television, but it was city by city which meant that there were
                    studios in each of the major cities and you could get transmission only if you
                    lived in that particular city. There was no cooperation or coordination between
                    the various television transmission stations. So, if you watched television in
                    Kabul last year in 2002 because it was controlled by adherence by the minister
                    of defense, what you got was, “what is [he] doing today and if.” In Herat the
                    local television station was like a Muslim religious channel. All you had was
                    sort of unhappy singing, music where you just had question and answer sessions,
                    where there are just speeches or what is the governor doing today, what did he
                    do yesterday? I'd be on TV quite frequently as a matter of fact because every
                    blessed visitor who went to his office was filmed and it was part of the news.
                    Every time I went to see him I was on the news that night.</p>
                <p>Now, what was also happening, the wonders of modern technology. You could get a
                    satellite dish in Herat and get something like 226 channels from around the
                    world and lots of people had this. There were satellite dishes on every
                    building, not every building, not the village houses in the city, but anyone who
                    was middle class had a satellite dish. The very first dinner I went to in Herat
                    at a private house, occurred oh, maybe I'd been there for about ten days and
                    some Afghan guys at a soccer match invited me for dinner. They were university
                    students. I went to their house for dinner. We were sitting on the floor in
                    their huge sort of reception room and the father and the uncle were there in
                    their long white robes and these guys were there. They were having a very
                    traditional meal when a couple of the little girls from the family, aged maybe
                    6, 7, 8 years old, came in and asked their father if they could watch TV and he
                    said yes. They went over to the TV in the corner and switched on the European
                    version of MTV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what MTV is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: MTV is the basically a music program that shows the latest in music
                    videos. I think it's gotten a bit too much. They turned on a program where I'm
                    sitting with a couple of old men in beards and we're talking about Islam
                    philosophy and American assistance to Afghanistan and out of the corner of my
                    eye I am watching nude dancing. No one thought there was a problem here. Now,
                    these university students told me that they'd had a satellite TV in that house
                    all through the Taliban and kept it concealed. They were rich. The rich have
                    satellite TV. We had a satellite TV in our house for our use and we got 226
                    channels. Of course it was always kept on AFN, the Armed Forces Network, but you
                    could get channels from all over the world including directly from the United
                    States. Now, what did people listen to in Herat? Herat radio was sad; it was
                    limited scope, not much imagination, very little planning or programming. Herat
                    television was the same. [Iran] was only five hours away by car. We got
                    broadcasting from [Iran] and anyone who had a TV could pick up Iranian
                    television stations. You had a pretty good range of Persian language
                    transmission and good music, good shows, good movies, good films, etc. The
                    Iranian version of the news, always the Iranian versions of the news.</p>
                <pb facs="0333" n="Page0333"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this brings up another question. We obviously have
                        been concerned since 1979 about you had a certain role in this about Iran
                        and meddling in other countries in spite of the Shiite village and all this.
                        What were the Iranians, what was the Iranian influence here in Herat, which
                        was called the window onto Iran or the door to Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I approached it with a certain sense of irony because we had 10,000 or
                    11,000 American soldiers occupying the country of Afghanistan. We had soldiers
                    in all of the major cities and in some of the non-major cities in units like the
                    one I was assigned to and were conducting military operations. It's an American
                    guard forces that lives with the president in the palace and protects him. So,
                    talking about Iran interference in the country of Afghanistan is a bit, but
                    having said that. Iran and Afghanistan share a language. They share a culture.
                    They share a religion. They share a common border. They share travel and
                    history. They share literature. They share music. This may be less true for the
                    [more distant] areas, but it's very, very true for Herat. Herat and [Iran] have
                    been linked throughout history in every possible way and very often in history
                    they were ruled by the same person as the two ends of the property of the local
                    leader. In Herat today if you want to go to Kabul you have to drive 400 miles
                    over a dirt road. It takes two full days and there are security problems along
                    the road. You get stopped. It's a hell of a drive. No one does it. There are
                    very high mountains between the two cities, 400 miles of mountain. It makes it
                    an unpleasant and difficult in bad weather to get anywhere. On the other hand,
                    if you are living in Herat and you want to go to a good furniture store, you
                    want to buy nice clothes, if you want to go to a good doctor, go to a good
                    dentist, if you want to go to a good school, all you have to do is drive a
                    couple of hours and you're in one of the most developed cities in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any motor problems in getting through the guards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0334" n="Page0334"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Not really. If you want to go to work, you have to get a work visa. But
                    for most people if they're just going for a couple of days, it was no problem at
                    all. I've been told that. Certainly anyone who had a serious medical problem
                    went to [Iran]. Now, out of all of the young men I knew in Herat, let's say 100
                    right here, I'm counting the guards that we had, other people I'd met, the young
                    students that I'd met, the young guys who worked in the shops and the stores
                    that I would talk to, every single one of them without exception had been to
                    Iran. Many of them had studied there and had lived there for a number of years.
                    Not one had ever been to Kabul. Over the last two and a half decades, travel to
                    Kabul had simply become impossible. It was either war or the Taliban or there
                    was no reason to go there. Kabul had nothing to offer. The good university had
                    sort of disappeared in the 1970s in a political maelstrom. So, if you wanted to
                    go to a good school and you sure weren't going to go to Kabul. If you wanted to
                    get anything at all, a medical checkup, there was no reason to go to Kabul,
                    there were no good doctors there either. People simply went to Iran. Now, having
                    said that, Afghans were not treated well by the Iranians. Iranians think of
                    Afghans as being-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hillbillies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Hillbillies, even worse, far worse. At their best the Iranians treat
                    Afghans the way the we treat- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>At worst they could be treated very, very harshly, badly. The Iranians dislike
                    Afghans. They think of them as inferior. The head of security in Herat was
                    talking about Iran once. He gave me a list of reasons why he disliked the
                    country. He had had lots of problems with the country. His mother had lived
                    there because she didn't want to come back to Herat so he'd have to go and visit
                    her, but he hated doing it. He said even when, he said, the Iranians look down
                    on us. He said, when I'm talking to an American whether or not I agree with the
                    American, I know that the American is looking at me as an equal. He's talking to
                    me like I'm a real person. He said, when Iranians talk with me even though I'm a
                    high ranking official, they look down on me. He said you could see it in the way
                    they talk and the way they act. He said even when they call you “brother” when
                    they're being Islamic, they mean you are the younger brother, you're not the
                    equal brother. Talking to another, I remember a woman who was [one] of the
                    representatives, talking about her time in Iran. I asked her how long she had
                    spent there and she said she mentioned the number of years and she said they
                    were the unhappiest days of my life. I have no good memories of Iran. You would
                    get this over and over again. It was sort of like they had to be there because
                    they had lost their homes, they had lost their jobs, conditions had gotten so
                    bad in Afghanistan, they'd have to run away, but they didn't like being there
                    and the Iranians treated them like they were savages.</p>

                <pb facs="0335" n="Page0335"/>
                <p>METRINKO: No, they weren't.</p>
                <p>Q: These were ones that had gone to Iran to be refugees.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, they went to Iran because to go to Pakistan was a two day trip and
                    you'd be going through much of the country that you were trying to get away
                    from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, they would find themselves in essentially an alien
                        culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes, so the Heratis tended to be far better educated than other people
                    in Afghanistan. Even the women, it was a higher level of education for women in
                    Herat than in other parts of Afghanistan and this was traditional. I think quite
                    a bit of it because of this relationship with Iran. What is the significance of
                    Iranian involvement now? Well, if you're the governor of Herat you have to be on
                    good terms with Iran. A big part of your electricity comes on lines straight out
                    of Iran into Herat Province. All of your trade coming from the West, all of your
                    machinery, your cars, your busses, your trucks, anything that is being imported
                    into the country is coming through Iran and the Iranians could turn off those
                    spigots immediately. All of your younger men from the villages and towns who are
                    job hunters have gone to Iran to look for work. They either have in the past or
                    they are there now. Many of your friends probably many of your relatives still
                    live in Irn because they simply have not come back to Afghanistan not trusting
                    that it is secure yet. So, you have that. You have the cultural influence. You
                    listen to music from Iran. You listen to the radio from Iran. Our cook had spent
                    several years in Iran and the radio station that you played in the kitchen was
                    also the [Iranian] radio station. The soap in our house was from Iran, the
                    detergent, lots of the food in our house came from Iran. If we bought new
                    furniture, desk furniture, you know, paper, things like that locally; it was
                    always from Iran. There is a very, very strong relationship. It's not one based
                    on love, but it sure is based on necessity and good business.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, then Mike, you're an old Iranian hand and had been as we documented
                    before, very much versed in Iranian affairs. Were you getting any reflection of
                    what I consider the ongoing civil war revolution in Iran sort of between the
                    modern and the Islamists and I don't know, you've described it differently. But
                    I mean I assume you couldn't help but being picking up vibes.</p>
                <pb facs="0336" n="Page0336"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I've talked to a lot of Afghans who had lived in Iran, had visited
                    there including people who had seen the actual demonstrations by the students
                    and seen the reaction, but I wasn't getting what I considered really good
                    information. They didn't go there for that reason and they generally were in the
                    eastern part of Iran and not in the places where there was a problem. Now, they
                    did talk and even joke a lot about how Iranian friends would tell them how lucky
                    they were that they had the Americans. They said that Iranian friends would
                    congratulate them for having the American army there. They would say they wished
                    it would come to Iran, but that's as far as they could go with that. I don't
                    want to talk about Iran unless I go there and see it myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, I understand, but I was wondering, you were
                        getting reflections. Was Mashhad, where did it fall in the Iranian political
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Mashhad is a very wealthy city, which sits smack dab in the middle of
                    the saffron industry. It's centered there. It has an incredible income because
                    it possesses the shrine of the leading Iranian saint. Every good Iranian does
                    pilgrimages there whenever there's a life crisis or lots of other times. It's a
                    manufacturing city, a major cultural, political and economic influence on the
                    country. The previous religious leadership of Mashhad that was there until the
                    Iranian revolution was shunted aside and the previous religious leader of the
                    city was put under house arrest. He has only come out of house arrest in the
                    last three or four years and is still adamantly almost anti-Khomeini and
                    anti-Islamic government. He's known for making comments in public even now that
                    he's out from under house arrest. That having been said, it probably will not
                    play a significantly role in the political life of Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, we're coming to the end of this episode aren't
                        we, don't you think? Is there anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I guess [we are]. What's happening now, when I left Afghanistan in
                    August of 2003 the PRT, the future, was being talked about. They were expanding.
                    More countries were taking over more of the PRTs, New Zealand, England, Germany,
                    etc. The security profile is changing there. NATO is now in there as the
                    international security force. I understand that the security presence of ISFA,
                    International Security Force for Afghanistan, is going to be extended to other
                    cities in the country, so things are changing. Whether this will improve the
                    security of the country or simply embroil what we call a green-on-green law I
                    don't know. You know, the expression green-on-green?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0337" n="Page0337"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Green-on-green is when local people fight and up until I left certainly
                    the standing rule was we do not get involved. If the local governor and the
                    local police chief want to go at it tooth and nail we let them. We're not
                    supposed to be involved in local warfare. It's probably a good idea because it
                    was never quite clear to me whether the Department of Defense, the Department of
                    State and various other agencies were supporting the same leaders in
                    Afghanistan. In fact I would say that we weren't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've just finished interviewing someone who was
                        essentially DCM in Mogadishu when we were going against Aidid and this is
                        where we got involved in a green on green war. It came out badly and it
                        usually does with this type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mike, one final question. I have a certain malice of forethought in asking this
                    because I think we've been over this before. You had these experiences. You
                    obviously spoke the language and all. Did you find that you were able to pass on
                    your knowledge through debriefing or something other than sort of chatting with
                    people in the corridor? Did anybody sort of ask you what you were doing and how
                    things were going and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>METRINKO: In the State Department?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No. Well, I know that my reports were well read. All of us and because
                    we had representatives in several different cities when I was there from the
                    State Department, it was a bit strange. We were doing reporting, but getting no
                    feedback and never seeing a final version of what we did and sent up to the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would send it to the embassy and it would go through
                        its filter I guess then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0338" n="Page0338"/>
                <p>METRINKO: Yes and then it would go off. I never once saw an incoming piece of
                    traffic to the embassy because I didn't receive traffic out in Herat. Therefore,
                    I did not know at all what the embassy was reporting. Remember the old cases in
                    the 1700s of what they used to call the wolf children? Children who were found
                    in the woods and had been raised without any human companionship. Sometimes I
                    felt like that as far as my reporting was concerned. I was out there. I was
                    doing things like meeting people, talking to people, representing the American
                    government or the American Embassy anyway, that part of the government, and
                    doing reporting, but all of it without any sense of being part of a system or an
                    organization. I was just out there and my salary was being put into the bank,
                    but no one ever told me what they wanted me to say, what they wanted me to do. I
                    was told that they trusted me to do whatever I thought was necessary. Now, I
                    don't know whether that was a failure based on lack of planning in the State
                    Department or whether they just felt that they could get more from me if they
                    just let me do my own thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, was there any attempt made to get your people doing
                        your job in other places all together to chat up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>Q: I was in Italy and every once in a while they would bring the consuls general
                    together to talk about what was happening in Italy and here is a place that's so
                    crucial.</p>
                <p>METRINKO: No. I spent six months in Afghanistan, in Herat rather and in the whole
                    six months I went up to Kabul once in the middle of my time. I only went up
                    because the Afghan student who was living in my house in the United States had
                    come back to Kabul to visit his parents and I wanted to see him. I found out
                    quite by chance that one of the other State Department people from one of the
                    other PRTs was also in the embassy, but we had no relationship either by
                    communications or any other way [with] each other. The embassy certainly did
                    not. There was never a general meeting, in other words, of those of us who were
                    out in the provinces with the political section or with any other section in the
                    embassy. No one coordinated this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your reports, e-mails, were they circulating
                        around, were you able to read traffic from other people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: No because they all did the same thing. They sent their reports
                    directly to the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0339" n="Page0339"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I come out of the Vietnam era and I remember a lot of my
                        colleagues who were provincial reporting officers and they would go to the
                        political section and many of them were not very happy with what came out. I
                        mean was there any, did you pick up any of that or is it just a blank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: I don't think there was any great degree of disagreement about the
                    country between myself and the political section. The political section in Kabul
                    did no traveling at all. It was locked into its office in Kabul and because of
                    the constant security, the perception of constant security problems, apparently
                    rarely left the environs of the embassy. It was also a transitory section;
                    people changed all the time. They're weren't assigned for very long and no one
                    had the language there. One person had a language, I take that back, in the
                    economic section. I had no sense of unity with the political section. I sent my
                    reports to the political counselor, the head of the section, the job that I'd
                    had the previous year. He was receptive and I understand that most of my stuff
                    went out without being changed, but I've never seen it. I've only seen one of my
                    finished telegrams out of all the things that I wrote; so I really don't know
                    how much they were editing or changing what I was saying.</p>
                <p>There were two ways they could have handled this. We live in the age of e-mail. I
                    could have gone to Herat and I could have sent draft copies of informal copies
                    of all of my reporting directly back to people in Washington. I chose not to do
                    this at all because in my time with the State Department I had been both
                    assigned to consulates outside of the capital city and I'd been assigned to
                    capital cities. I believed that people in the provinces should coordinate what
                    they're doing through the embassy. I saw no purpose in trying to run my own
                    reporting program, reporting independently to Washington. I could have. I don't
                    think anyone would have noticed actually, but I told the head of the political
                    section that I would not send anything to Washington at all. Now, I started to
                    send some things directly to Washington my last month just because it was no
                    longer clear to me that anyone was taking care of any of the reporting. There
                    had been so many changes in Kabul that I didn't even know if my reporting was
                    going out at all and no one seemed to know. There was just this whole flurry of
                    changes. The whole political section changed. There was a lack of personnel, no
                    secretary, etc., so I just started sending things directly, but sending the
                    original copy by e-mail to Washington, to Kabul. Other than that I wanted to be
                    a team player. The ambassador and I would exchange e-mails about once a day,
                    usually on fairly minor things. I would send [my drafts] to the ambassador, the
                    DCM and the political section. Without fail either the DCM or the ambassador
                    would always say good job, nice report, great report, something like that. That
                    would be it. I don't know if that was true of others who were doing my job in
                    other cities because there weren't very many who had had political reporting
                    experience. I don't think any of them had regional experience; so they're things
                    may have been a bit more edited.</p>
                <p>Q: All right, well, I'm not sure if this is the end of your saga, but we'll type
                    this up. Any thoughts about going out again?</p>
                <pb facs="0340" n="Page0340"/>
                <p>METRINKO: I'm supposed to be going back to Kabul in the very near future in the
                    next few weeks, but not with the government. I'm going and taking a job with a
                    private foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What foundation is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Well, I'm still talking about the offer with them, it's with the Asia
                    Foundation. The job is interesting. It's a contract job. It will give me a lot
                    more independence of movement than I would have in the embassy. The work is all
                    involved with helping set up the framework for the coming election and also for
                    doing political analysis of the election, but not [just] politically
                    correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Good, well, keep in mind when you come back from that
                        let us know and we'll grab you again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>METRINKO: Fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Thank you very much.</hi>
