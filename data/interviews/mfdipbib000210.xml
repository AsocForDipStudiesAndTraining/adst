                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, let me welcome you to the first of a series of
                        sessions that we will hold. My first question will be to ask you to talk a
                        little about your background with the object of trying to find out what lead
                        you into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I was born in Boston in 1931, but I was for the most part raised in
                    New York and Washington. I attended schools in Washington until I entered
                    Phillips Academy, Andover. After that, I started Yale University, where I
                    graduated in 1953 with an English major.</p>
                <p>Following graduation, I entered the Air Force and after a year's training, was
                    assigned to Germany where I flew transport planes all over Europe. It was during
                    this tour that I developed an interest and a desire to join the Foreign Service.
                    I had heard about the Foreign Service from friends at Yale, who were considering
                    joining that organization, although none of then ever did. On several occasions,
                    while in Munich during my military service, I went to the Consulate General,
                    where I had some friends. They of course told me a lot more about the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>When I left the Air Force in 1956, I first worked in the Department of the Navy
                    in Washington. (My first job offer was from the NEW YORK TIMES which was looking
                    for a copy boy for $48 per week, which was not enough to make ends meet.) While
                    working for the Navy, I attended Georgetown's Foreign Service School at night in
                    an effort to raise my academic standards which had been somewhat lackluster at
                    Yale. By this time, it was clear to me that I wanted to be involved in
                    international relations. Most of my family had devoted their lives to the
                    government. I had three older cousins—Harlan, Van and Stanley—who had encouraged
                    me in the direction of government work, even while I was in college. Stanley
                    actually was Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>While at Georgetown, I took courses in international economics, diplomatic
                    history and other such subject matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I took the Foreign Service written entrance examination in December, 1956 in
                    Washington and the oral in early 1957—both in Washington. The written was at
                    this time a three hour exam—multiple choice—in which I managed to get about
                    three out of four answers correctly. I felt that if an applicant had had good
                    freshmen classes in several disciplines, he or she could pass the exam. There
                    were for example several questions on weather, which I was able to answer in
                    light of my Air Force experience. But during the oral examination, one of the
                    panel members noted that I had not done so well in the economic section,
                    answering only three out of 34 questions correctly. I pointed out that that was
                    pretty good because I had only tried to answer four econ questions. I must say
                    the panel was not amused by my response.</p>
                <p>The panel members were properly stern. The first part of that examination was
                    relatively easy because, as I anticipated, they asked me a lot of personal
                    questions about my background. Then the questions began to change. I remember
                    one that dealt with the economic change in the United States and particularly
                    with the move south of the New England industrial base. I fumbled around with
                    that answer for a while. After the end of the interview, the candidate was asked
                    to step outside the room and await the decision. When the panel summoned me
                    back, the chairman said that I had passed, but “weakly”. He suggested that I
                    need considerable more knowledge. Nevertheless, I was very pleased to have
                    passed both the written and oral ordeals.</p>
                <p>After the oral, I had to wait for the medical and security clearances. In fact,
                    the process was rather expeditious because I think many new recruits were being
                    taken in that year. I entered the Foreign Service in July, 1957 and went to the
                    A-100 course of the Foreign Service Institute. I don't remember too much about
                    that course, but I believe that it was a pretty good, highly concentrated few
                    weeks of indoctrination into the Department of State and the Foreign Service. I
                    believe that the consular segment of the course lasted for a week or two, and
                    was a very good introduction into a subject with which I never subsequently had
                    any acquaintance. I was one of the rare recruits who never had to serve in a
                    consular job; most of my colleagues did.</p>
                <p>What else? I remember Bushrod Axel from the Department of Agriculture telling us
                    that there were about three million farmers at the time which was about twice as
                    many as necessary. We had someone who talked to us about cross-cultural
                    experiences which I found fascinating. Loy Henderson told us to do our best, not
                    worry about the next guy.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>There were about 25-30 members in my class. It consisted of a great variety of
                    people. Some, like Frank Carlucci, became well known—although Frank didn't join
                    the class until about mid course. He had been in the Foreign Service for more
                    than a year, but had never attended the A-100 course. Bob Oakley and Dan
                    O'Donahue were members. As I suppose happens frequently, some of us in that
                    entrance course are still friends to this day—almost forty years later. There
                    were a very few women, mostly in the preceding classes. One of the questions I
                    had been asked during my orals was to discuss the new practice of appointing new
                    Foreign Service officers from a broad spectrum of universities and colleges—not
                    restricting the Foreign Service to Ivy League graduates. I said that geographic
                    distribution was a meritorious goal, but that excellence should never be
                    diluted. My class had several Ivy League graduates, but also included some very
                    capable people from all regions of the US. I don't recall that we had any
                    minorities in the class.</p>
                <p>The A-100 course lasted about four months. I did not attend the subsequent
                    consular course which people whose first assignments would be in that line of
                    work were required to attend. Somewhat to my disappointment, my first assignment
                    was to a Washington office—A/OPR. I had expressed some interest in becoming an
                    economic officer—at least for a few years—which is probably why I was assigned
                    to the administrative area. My cousins had all been involved in economic
                    matters, which undoubtedly influenced my views to a degree. I must admit that I
                    didn't have the slightest idea what A/OPR was. I looked at the phone directory
                    to see what the initials stood for. When my assignment was announced, I
                    remembered that one of the oral examination panel members had asked me whether I
                    would be interested in being an administrative officer. Not having the slightest
                    idea what “administration” was, but perhaps believing that it involved running
                    the Foreign Service, I think that I suggested that I would not have any
                    objections to such assignment. That could well have been the reason for my
                    assignment to A/OPR. I am not at all sure now how I spent my days in that
                    office, but I do remember that I was located in an unairconditioned old Navy
                    annex office for about six months. About three or four junior officers were
                    assigned to A/OPR. My A-100 colleagues did not commiserate about my fate since
                    such assignments were relatively commonplace then; many junior officers were
                    assigned to administrative functions, as well of course to the consular
                    operations. We did commiserate with a fellow named Jim Duffey who was sent to
                    Vientiane, Laos, as the Budget and Fiscal Officer. That didn't look like a very
                    promising career start. In fact, he left the Foreign Service soon afterwards to
                    work for the Mellon Bank.</p>
                <p>From A/OPR, I went on to become the special assistant to Tom Estes, then the head
                    of OPR. Estes was a very nice man—a fine individual. He was full of energy and
                    managed to accomplish a lot of things. One of his major tasks was the
                    construction of the present State Department building, then under construction.
                    That was in addition to the myriad of smaller tasks that fall on OPR. But my
                    strongest memories of Estes had to do with his decency as a human being.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>One of the basic concerns of the day was the personal conduct of Foreign Service
                    Officers overseas. An Ambassador had sold an automobile for twice the amount
                    that it had cost him. That became a celebrated case. We had another similar case
                    in an another country. All of these episodes resulted in a very lengthy
                    memorandum to the Assistant Secretary for Administration outlining a set of
                    recommendations intended to develop a new standard of conduct overseas. I was
                    involved in writing up a guidebook on this subject.</p>
                <p>In OPR, I didn't learn a lot about the part of the Department in which I
                    subsequently spent most of my career—East Asia. I did obviously learn something
                    about administration that stood me in good stead later, although again, I think,
                    the assignment would have been more valuable to me if it had come after I had
                    had more experience in the Department.</p>
                <p>I was busy enough during these two years, but less so than later. You must
                    remember that I was a brand new junior officer and had lots to learn. I don't
                    know that I performed as well as I might have, had I had more experience. I am
                    not sure that I always knew what I was doing and I certainly was passive because
                    I still had so much to learn. The OPR special assistant reviewed all mail coming
                    to the Deputy Assistant Secretary; I would always ask Estes what I should do
                    about one matter or another. With more experience, I think I could have
                    initiated some actions on my own.</p>
                <p>One thing that I did was to review all inspection reports which at the time were
                    both numerous and voluminous. I briefed them for Estes so that he would have a
                    feeling how our part of the administrative function was being performed both at
                    home and overseas. I worked closely with Dot Burris, Estes' secretary, on
                    numerous small projects; i.e. I did a lot of things that she didn't want to do
                    or for which she didn't have time. I followed Jim Rosenthal in the special
                    assistant job; he also was a junior officer. Years later, Estes ran into us one
                    day when we were together chatting; that started a reminiscing discussion of our
                    OPR days which was a lot of fun. As I said, I thought highly of Estes. I was
                    also impressed by others like Ambassador Robert Newbegin. As a newcomer, I
                    thought that all of those I had contact with were fine people. They all seemed
                    bright and competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1959, you then went to Canberra. How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Before I went to Canberra, I went back to FSI to learn a foreign
                    language. That was German in my case; that was the language that I had chosen
                    because I had lived in Munich when in the Air Force and had some knowledge of
                    the language. I had enjoyed Germany and hoped that sometime I might return to it
                    for a tour. I achieved the 3-3 level and was then assigned, naturally, to
                    Canberra, Australia—an English speaking post. I was somewhat disappointed with
                    the assignment, but at least I had heard of the place. I called Carter, my wife,
                    to tell her the news. When I got home that evening, she asked why we were going
                    to Canberra. When I inquired further, she told me that it was in the middle of
                    the Amazon jungle. She had found a place named “Canbra”, which was in the
                    jungle. I think she was quite relieved when she found out that our future lay in
                    civilization. In any case, the assignment came as a surprise. I am not sure
                    there was much rhyme or reason for it, but it was an assignment as an economic
                    officer which I welcomed.</p>
                <p>The Economic Section in Canberra was a three-officer section; I was the junior
                    man. Unlike some of my colleagues, I did not have a rotational assignment; I was
                    the only junior officer in the Embassy; there were a couple assigned to our
                    Consulate General in Sydney—one of whom was Tony Quainton—later ambassador to
                    several posts—and another was Jay Katzen. I went right to the Economic Section
                    and stayed there for two years of a three year tour. Bill Knight was the
                    Economic Counselor—he was succeeded by Eddie Shott. Then there was a labor
                    officer. Knight was very bright and personable. The Embassy also had an
                    Agricultural Attach� who had an Australian assistant. Between the two of them,
                    they did all of the agricultural reports, which were numerous.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time collecting economic data, which became the basis for
                    reports. I did not initially write any of the reports, but later on, I
                    participated in drafting those reports. I remember well the first one that I
                    did; it was so full of blue corrections, that I was really upset. I talked to
                    the labor attach� about what Knight had done to my report; he suggested that I
                    forget about it. Then I went to Knight to ask him about my first report; he just
                    said that I would have to learn to do better. He was right; I had a lot to
                    learn, especially about writing, but my pride was certainly wounded after that
                    first drafting experience. Eddie Shott was a better teacher; he would spend time
                    with me going over each report to help me improve not only my analysis, but my
                    presentation as well. Shott really became a mentor; he felt a responsibility
                    toward the junior officers that worked for him and spent time with me to help
                    improve my performance. He was meticulous about his efficiency reports and
                    generally quite fair; he would make changes in the ER, if his original comments
                    seemed entirely unfair to me. He was a good leader. I have always been grateful
                    for the time he spent training me. At that stage of my development, I had to
                    learn to write; I thought I knew, but I learned that I needed a good deal of
                    tutoring and I am thankful that Eddie gave me the time. I believe that under his
                    steady guidance, I did improve.</p>
                <p>In those days, we still had a lot of mandatory reports that all posts had to
                    submit. A lot of those were routine.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The Ambassador was William Sebald, a former Admiral who had been on Douglas
                    MacArthur's staff in Tokyo and had been our Ambassador to Burma. He was a small,
                    acerbic man, described by the Station Chief as “not a leader of men”. He
                    severely chastised me one morning because a cable had not gotten out the night
                    before. I told him that I had completed and given the telegram to his secretary
                    the previous afternoon. That didn't seem to placate him; he told me in no
                    uncertain terms that it was an officer's duty to make sure that his or her work
                    was completed by the day's end and on its way to Washington; that was not his
                    secretary's responsibility. I didn't respond, but I thought that Sebald was
                    wrong both on the merits and on the process. Sebald was a “hands-on” manager,
                    but he certainly was not very popular with is staff.</p>
                <p>In 1961, Sebald was replaced by Bill Battle, the son of the former governor of
                    Virginia—an up and coming lawyer with political connections in Virginia who had
                    been a PT boat commander in President Kennedy's WWII squadron. Through that
                    connection he had been appointed Ambassador to Australia. He was extremely
                    popular; he became a leading figure in Canberra almost from the moment he
                    arrived, partly because he was a scratch golfer—in fact, he went on to become
                    the President of the United States Golf Association. I liked Battle
                    tremendously, and also his lovely wife, Barrie.</p>
                <p>The DCM was Bill Belton. He was not an Australian expert; in fact he had spent
                    most of his career in Latin America. He was a good officer and we enjoyed
                    working for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>When we arrived, Canberra was a relatively small city—about 40,000 people. While
                    we were there, it grew approximately 50%. Now it is about 300,000. It was a
                    delightful small city with a fairly high concentration of intelligent people. It
                    was the seat of government; it was the home of the Australian National
                    University; it had a large diplomatic corps, as well as a large number of media
                    people. The social life centered around the outdoors—tennis, golf, swimming,
                    etc. As I said, it was the Capital of Australia; there was a Parliament
                    building. Many of the delegates did not reside in Canberra. But most of
                    Ministers and their staffs lived in Canberra, so that I would see socially a lot
                    of those that I dealt with officially. The social life was very relaxed and
                    pleasant. We had several circles of friends—one of government people—Foreign and
                    Trade Ministries, some of whom we are still in touch with. One is the Australian
                    Ambassador to NATO; he is the godparent of one of our children. Then we had a
                    circle of friends who had nothing to do with our official capacity; it was a
                    circle that we were never fully able to replicate in later years. These were
                    doctors and lawyers whom we met here and there. We went skiing with some of them
                    on several occasions. The third circle of friends consisted of people our age
                    and rank in other embassies, some of whom we have kept track of. The social life
                    was fairly active, although as you rise in the Foreign Service it becomes more
                    active and more burdensome. In Canberra, life was extremely pleasant; it was
                    great for raising our children-actually one was born there. We lived at 1A Mugga
                    Way, which has recently been torn down. It was a nice house in a very nice
                    neighborhood within walking distance of the Embassy. In retrospect, our tour in
                    Canberra was a lot of fun; it may not have been professionally sufficiently
                    challenging—although I learned a fair amount—but it certainly was pleasant
                    enough. It was a good tour.</p>
                <p>As I said, I did a lot of statistical research. I took what were primarily
                    government press releases on economic conditions in Australian and translated
                    those into reports for Washington. My first venture outside this relatively
                    mundane task was a series of reports I wrote after taking the sole trip I took
                    with the Ambassador, although I may have accompanied him on a couple of short
                    trips to Sydney. He went all around Australia and I reported on our various
                    stops—the asbestos mines in Western Australia, the “stations” in central
                    Australia, the Kakatoo Island iron ore development. By this time, I had learned
                    to write reasonably well—I might add that Carter had actually done some of the
                    research on the mines for me which helped my reporting considerably. My trip
                    enabled me to talk to a lot of people gaining a lot of knowledge that I could
                    not have gotten from publications. So I was able to put together some brief
                    reports on economic matters that had not been covered before. It was my first
                    real contribution in the Foreign Service. The US Bureau of Mines wrote me a note
                    welcoming my reports. Some of my findings surprised them.</p>
                <p>The Cleveland family also traveled on its own in Australia—to Queensland, the
                    Great Barrier reef—a grand and wonderful experience—to Melbourne and to some
                    other cities.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>There has been an almost time honored tradition of rivalry in Australia between
                    the Embassy and the large Consulates General, particularly Sydney. I became
                    marginally involved in that because, as the junior member of the Embassy staff,
                    I did consular work, which consisted of issuing diplomatic visas; i.e. a
                    clerical job, stamping visas into the officials' passports. If I took action
                    beyond that, Orrie Taft, the consular officer in Sydney, would jump up and down
                    in rage because he felt that I was invading his “turf”. From Taft's point of
                    view, allowing me to give out diplomatic visas was already a great favor that he
                    was doing me. I hardly shared his view; in fact, I thought that Taft was putting
                    a real damper on any kind of initiative that I might have wished to take; it was
                    the most bureaucratic attitude that I think I ever faced in the Foreign Service.
                    In general, I think the Consulate General in Sydney did try to exercise as much
                    independence of the Embassy as it could. Larry Vass was the CG; he had been the
                    chief of the Aviation Division in the Department. He was a substantial character
                    and he made a point of dealing with the top businessmen in Sydney. He would come
                    to the Embassy periodically to report on his contacts; in fact, he did have a
                    substantial operation in Sydney, which essentially ran itself.</p>
                <p>My first tour as an economic officer was helpful in that I became trained as a
                    reporting officer, even if much of the training was unconscious growth. I did
                    feel at the time that I was certainly not yet a real economic officer; I had not
                    had much academic background in the subject, and I had still lots to learn about
                    GNP, national income, budgets, etc. In fact, I took a course in Keynesian
                    economics at Canberra University College, which later became part of the
                    Australian National University. That was very helpful in making me more aware of
                    the “dismal” science.</p>
                <p>My lecturer at CUC was a man named Coombs. I remember him primarily because he
                    would often arrive in the classroom visibly inebriated. I know that some have
                    accused the ANU of taking a leftist view of economics, but I think Coombs did
                    not tilt his lectures; it was straight Keynes. There was some communist
                    influence in the University, but I don't think that I ever viewed ANU as a
                    communist front. The Labor Party, on the other hand, did harbor some radical
                    leftists—people who advocated extreme measures. I don't want to leave the
                    impression that the Labor Party as a whole was a communist party; it was not.
                    The majority of its members were simply progressively oriented, but still in the
                    main stream of political thinking—they were not communists by any stretch of the
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>I attended an Australian political association conference held in Albert Hall in
                    Canberra—the coldest place in the Southern Hemisphere. While shivering, I
                    listened to many speakers. One was Bob Hawke, then a young firebrand of the
                    Labor Party. Even then, he was viewed by many as a potential future leader of
                    the Party. At the time, he was a member of the Australian Council of Trade
                    Unions (ACTU). Hawke gave a fiery speech about bread lines and destitute workers
                    and the downtrodden Australian masses. I was sitting behind Gough Whitlam (later
                    an Australian PM), and I think it was the consensus of the attendees that Hawke
                    was there to make an impression—that the substance was not as important as the
                    ear catching phrases. There were in fact no bread lines, no major unemployment,
                    no downtrodden in 1962.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>We did become friends with H.W. Arndt, who was a German Jewish refugee who had
                    come to Australia after WWII, and was certainly in the left-center part of the
                    Labor Party—I guess he was basically a socialist. He was a well known
                    economist—a professor at ANU. We became personal friends and remain so still.
                    Undoubtedly, by osmosis, I learned a little of how a socialist saw the world and
                    gained some insights into their views of the capitalist world. But I don't
                    believe that whatever leftist sympathies may have resided at ANU had any impact
                    on my academic learning. As I suggested, we had a fairly wide circle of
                    Australian friends. I liked them very much; they were very much like Americans,
                    although they steadfastly refused to acknowledge any such comparison. We used to
                    have long discussions on that subject, which made me increasingly aware of the
                    growing sense of nationalism cropping up in Australia, particularly among the
                    younger Australians. I think Americans and Australians always got along very
                    well; there were some cultural differences, but fundamentally we were very much
                    alike, and I enjoyed their company immensely. This friendship was of course
                    helped by the fact that in the period of my tour, there were no major issues
                    between the two countries. We had some differences over agricultural policies,
                    but nothing major. During my last year in Canberra, while I was serving in the
                    political section, I did notice the beginning of tensions concerning our bases
                    and military forces in Australia.</p>
                <p>Prime Minister Menzies was a great figure in my eyes. I met with him, shook his
                    hand and exchanged a few words with him. I was greatly impressed with him, but
                    then at that stage of life, I was highly impressionable anyway.</p>
                <p>As I said, I spent the last of my year of my Canberra tour in the Political
                    Section. One of the officers in the Embassy died and another resigned from the
                    Foreign Service. So suddenly, the Embassy found itself short-handed. I had
                    gotten along well with Eddie Shott and Bill Belton, and they asked me whether I
                    would consider extending my tour for one more year. I would be switched to the
                    Political Section to take the junior reporting officer position there, even
                    though the job was rated higher than my own grade. I thought that it was a great
                    opportunity and therefore went to work for Don Lamm, the Political Counselor.
                    Lamm had been described by Belton as an “old shoe diplomat”; he had been in the
                    Foreign Service for many years and had served in Canberra previously. Between
                    Australian tours, he had served in Africa; he always recalled that President
                    Nixon had visited his post and had taken exception to something that Lamm had
                    done, which ruined his career. But he happily returned to Australia where he and
                    Belton would spend some of their off-duty time bird watching. Don was also a
                    mentor, although probably not as precisely or as doggedly as Shott had been, but
                    he was very nice and attentive. I remember that almost every Friday evening I
                    would go to his house, have a beer and discuss the state of the world or the
                    Foreign Service. Don had a great big German shepherd named “Lilly”, who would
                    attack me whenever she saw me; that became a game after a while.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The Political Section was a two-men section; I was obviously the Number Two. Don
                    was busy with the start of the negotiations on the new intelligence collection
                    bases that we were trying to establish—a highly classified operation at the
                    time. That left me to do most of what I would call the “routine” reporting. I
                    did the WEEKA report, which required a meeting every week of the various
                    components of the Embassy in which we decided what was worthy of reporting and
                    analysis. I chaired those meetings even though much more senior officers like
                    Shott attended. The WEEKA was intended to be a weekly summary and analysis of
                    political events and trends. So the WEEKA became my major responsibility—putting
                    it together, the editing and the despatch of it. I learned a lot from that
                    exercise about how to write and edit reports.</p>
                <p>I also did some reporting of my own, mainly out of publicly available material;
                    it was mostly a summary of media stories with sometimes a comment of my own
                    added at the end.</p>
                <p>In the last year, I started to cover Parliament. I had not done that before and I
                    think I was probably too new at that kind of coverage, so I did not probably do
                    as much contact work with Parliamentarians as a more seasoned officer might
                    have. As in every deliberate body, there was always a lot of activity; without
                    guidance, I did not have the experience to distinguish the wheat from the chaff.
                    I did meet some of the younger Parliamentarians, including Malcolm Fraser, who
                    subsequently became Prime Minister and Douglas Anthony, who became head of the
                    Country Party. These politicians were all about my age and I used to talk to
                    them periodically. I began to understand the process of talking to politicians,
                    which obviously is an important task for a Foreign Service officer. And I liked
                    it immensely.</p>
                <p>I used to talk to these parliamentarians most often in large common rooms. Their
                    offices were in an old Parliamentary building—very small and sparse and cramped.
                    I would also see them socially, as in the Canberra Hotel Bar on Friday nights. I
                    also called on Foreign Ministry people in their offices to talk about matters of
                    mutual concern. We did not have any major problems with the Australians at the
                    time. There was considerable interest in Washington about the Australian labor
                    movement which kept our Labor Attach� busy. But international political
                    problems—none that I can really remember. It was mostly a matter of coordinating
                    common views.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>During my last summer in Australia, at my own expense because the Embassy refused
                    to pay, I went to Papua New Guinea. That was the most interesting experience I
                    had during my first tour “down under”. I had become more or less conversant with
                    the requirements of a political reporting officer, although it was a slow
                    learning curve. I realized from that work that the emergence of Papua New Guinea
                    might well become a difficult problem. Australia was the trustee for that
                    territory under a UN mandate, but there was considerable talk at ANU and in
                    other fora that Australia needed to begin to think about how Papua New Guinea
                    might become independent. Don Lamm had gone there during the previous summer and
                    I wanted to see the land for myself. So I went at my own expense. I stayed there
                    for about 10 days and talked to 80-90 people. It was absolutely fascinating. We
                    had no representation in Papua New Guinea; its coverage was actually in the
                    Canberra consular district. Because of that, incidentally, I had been deeply
                    involved in Governor Nelson Rockefeller's son's disappearance. I was the contact
                    point in the Embassy on all questions concerning that unfortunate event. The
                    Dutch tried to help find him, but neither they nor anyone was ever
                    successful.</p>
                <p>I made appointments with various Papua New Guinea personalities through the
                    Australian Ministry of Territories. I also got some help from the CIA man at the
                    Embassy who used his good offices with his Australian counterparts. So I saw a
                    lot of people. I went to Port Moresby and Rabaul and Lae and Goroka. I saw
                    coffee planters; I saw patrol officers overlooking the far reaches of the
                    Australian domains—they were literally going into the jungles shaking people out
                    of trees. I ranged far and wide by plane primarily; you didn't drive in Papua
                    New Guinea in the 1960s; it was mostly jungle with very few if any roads
                    connecting the cities. Once in a city, you could drive around and go a few miles
                    outside, but transportation between cities was by plane unless you wanted to
                    trek on jungle paths cut out during WWII.</p>

                <p>I had talked to a lot of people in Canberra about Papua New Guinea. It was the
                    first time in my career that I had become steeped in a single subject—the
                    independence of Papua New Guinea. From all my conversations both in Canberra and
                    in Papua New Guinea I came to the conclusion that there was absolutely no
                    indigenous political development in the territory. The Australians offered their
                    rules and regulations and processes, but no local organizations had actually
                    been developed, even though some Australian officials were trying to encourage
                    political development. So in the early 1960s, there were virtually no indigenous
                    political organizations in Papua-New Guinea. Efrahim Jubilee of Raboul had gone
                    to the UN along with an Australian—Dudley McCarthy; there was John Guise—part
                    French—who could walk through a marketplace and be recognized by everybody. But
                    there was no single local person who knew how to organize a political group.
                    There were very few natives who had received a university education; in terms of
                    political education and experience, there was virtually none. Approximately 13
                    years later, Papua-New Guinea achieved its independence. It had gone a long way
                    from what I saw in 1962. Most of the people I talked to were Australians. I
                    probably talked to no more than half a dozen Papua New Guineans largely because
                    they were not that accessible. I think many of the Australians I talked to
                    understood that Papua-New Guinea should and would achieve independence. They had
                    seen the model in Africa and other parts of the world and understood that
                    Australia would have to give Papua-New Guinea its independence sooner rather
                    than later. As I suggested, it was this awakening in the Australian psyche that
                    caused me to be interested in Papua-New Guinea in the first place. There were
                    people who felt very strongly that Papua-New Guineans had to be turned into a
                    modern political system as quickly as possible. Both Don Lamm and I focused on
                    the questions whether the necessary indigenous leadership existed or was being
                    developed. My conclusion was that such leadership did not exist nor were there
                    enough people close to reaching the necessary level of organizing ability and
                    sophistication.</p>
                <p>Even on the economic side, the major developments were under the guidance of the
                    Australians. Many retired military officers had been granted large plots of land
                    for development and they built coffee plantations. It was a marvelous
                    illustration of pioneering, particularly in the highlands. I met some marvelous
                    human beings, particularly Australians—most of them homesteaders, some of whom
                    had been extraordinarily successful.</p>
                <p>I spent a very interesting evening with some Australians in Port Moresby,
                    listening to what they had been doing to bring the Papua-New Guineas into the
                    modern world. I took pages and pages of notes; unfortunately, the note book was
                    lost somewhere along the line. I did send a brief despatch to the Department at
                    the end of my trip, but I did so grudgingly because I was annoyed that the
                    government had not paid for my trip. I thought that it was part of my official
                    duties and that I had earned to some measure greater support than I had received
                    from the Embassy. So my attitude was that this was my own trip and my
                    observations were essentially mine, and since no one seemed to have cared very
                    much, I didn't really extend myself in reporting my findings. Nevertheless, I
                    found the trip personally very rewarding; I learned a lot about a remote part of
                    the world, which had been left behind essentially by progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>This experience with Papua New Guinea brings to mind the issue of immigration to
                    Australia which was being vigorously debated in the country in the early 1960s.
                    One of my tasks in the Embassy was to put together a small reference library
                    which included primarily material on Australia. Included in this small
                    collection were a couple of books about the White Australia policy. I read them
                    and became interested in the general subject of immigration. I called the
                    Foreign Ministry to ask it about the “White Australia” immigration policy. My
                    question was met by a long silence. Finally, the man at the other end of the
                    phone suggested that I call the Ministry of Immigration, which I did. I said
                    that I would like to come to speak to someone about Australian immigration
                    policy. That was not easy, but I finally spoke to some one who claimed to be the
                    Ministry's spokesman. I asked him about the “white” immigration policy. He
                    denied that any such policy existed. I told him that I had just read a book
                    which clearly documented that in fact there was such a policy. The spokesman
                    said that he didn't care what I had read and that there was no such thing as a
                    “white” Australian immigration policy. Despite the evidence to the contrary, the
                    spokesman continued to deny that any such policy existed. I wrote all of this up
                    in a report. I am convinced that there was an exclusionary policy and that only
                    “whites” needed to apply for immigration. The Australians had a euphemism for it
                    and denied its existence, but there was a clear exclusionary policy for all
                    applicants, but whites.</p>
                <p>As far as I know, we never made an issue of it; it may have been mentioned in
                    passing at some private meetings but we certainly did not make an issue of it at
                    higher levels. Perhaps the Australians thought that my inquiries were a prelude
                    to some American initiative, which I am sure made them so defensive; little did
                    they realize that I was essentially just satisfying a personal curiosity! I just
                    naively blundered into a very sensitive issue.</p>
                <p>I must say that the Australians were very sensitive to accusations on this point.
                    They discussed their own views with us openly from time to time. I think most of
                    my contacts—young Australians—reflected some concern about the potential
                    “invasion” of Asians. The fear was that if the door were opened just a crack,
                    the trickle would be followed by a flood which would quickly overwhelm the 12
                    million Australians living on the continent. I think that this fear has by now
                    subsided, but it certainly was a major concern in the early 1960s. Although at
                    that time the majority view was an exclusionary one, there were voices calling
                    for a more liberal immigration policy basing their argument that Australia was
                    in South Asia and that it had to find some ways to be a better neighbor. But I
                    think among my friends and acquaintances, the existing immigration policy had
                    strong support.</p>
                <p>That tour in Canberra was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot,
                    and Carter and I also had a wonderful time. I believe our daughters Robin and
                    Sandy remember it happily. And our first son, James, was born there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in November 1962, you were assigned to Bonn. Was that
                        perhaps because you had taken German language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think that that might have had something to do with it. Also in the
                    annual questionnaire, I had requested an assignment to a German post. My first
                    planned assignment to Germany, actually, was to be a consular officer in Munich.
                    Then that was changed to consular officer in Hamburg. My DCM—Belton—in Canberra,
                    together with John Ausland—then the Consul in Auckland—intervened and managed to
                    get me assigned as staff assistant to our Ambassador in Germany. That assignment
                    turned out to be just short of a disaster for my career.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador when I first arrived was Walter “Red” Dowling. I didn't know him
                    when the assignment was made, but I was in Washington for a brief period trying
                    to learn something about Germany and met Dowling then, while he was in
                    Washington for consultations. He sort of looked me over and allowed the
                    assignment to stand. So I went to Bonn, replacing an A-100 classmate, Alan Lee,
                    as Dowling's staff aide. The DCM was Brewster Morris, who left soon thereafter
                    to be our Ambassador to the Chad. Then we had Martin Hillenbrand as DCM, who was
                    a great person.</p>
                <p>Coburn Kidd was the Political Counselor; the Economic Minister was Ed Cronk.
                    Basil Capella was the Administrative Counselor. For about the first four months
                    of my tour in Bonn, I was assigned to the Political Section because Lee had not
                    yet left. I was a staff aide “in waiting”.</p>
                <p>The Embassy in Bonn was huge—900 Americans, 600 Germans. The Americans all lived
                    in Plittersdorf—the “Golden Ghetto.” We liked that; the apartments were spacious
                    and it was a great place for kids. It did cut us off from the German community,
                    which disappointed me. I had hoped to become fluent in German and to become
                    thoroughly acquainted with Germany. Living was easy—an American school, a club,
                    a commissary, a protected environment—but it was not entirely satisfactory from
                    a professional point of view. We did become acquainted with some Germans because
                    my staff assistant job required some contacts with the Foreign Office and the
                    Chancellor's Office primarily on administrative and protocol issues. That
                    brought me into contact with a number of German officials, with whom we then
                    socialized. There were also a few Germans who actually lived in Plittersdorf,
                    with whom we became acquainted.</p>
                <p>As was true in most European capitals, there was a circle of junior officers from
                    all embassies who used to socialize together. In fact, a couple of them had been
                    in Canberra during our time there. One of our acquaintances was David Cornwall,
                    a junior officer in the British Embassy, who later became known as John LeCarre.
                    Unbeknownst to me at least, he was then writing “The Spy Who Came in From the
                    Cold”. He was fascinating and a delightful dinner companion, who told brilliant
                    stories in three languages.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>But then the situation changed very rapidly. In early May, 1963, George McGhee
                    arrived to succeed Dowling. He had been the Counselor and then the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs in the Department. He apparently was fired by
                    Kennedy, but Dean Rusk, who had been the Assistant Secretary for FE when McGhee
                    was his counterpart for NEA, saved McGhee by sending him to Bonn as Ambassador.
                    The story as I heard it told was that Rusk went to Kennedy and said that he
                    would like to keep McGhee in the Department, to which the President agreed as
                    long as it was not in Washington. So McGhee was given his choice of
                    Ambassadorial assignments and chose Germany. At the time, Dowling was in a New
                    York hospital undergoing surgery. He was told while laying in his hospital bed
                    that he had been relieved of his duties as Ambassador to Germany. Dowling never
                    came back to Bonn, so I never worked as his aide.</p>
                <p>McGhee arrived in Bonn only a few months after I did. As I said, I was to replace
                    Lee in the Spring of 1963. But President Kennedy decided to make a trip to
                    Germany—the Germans at the time were somewhat depressed about their
                    circumstances and we were worried about our relationships. The Berlin Wall had
                    been put up and the Soviets were interfering with our access to Berlin.
                    Essentially, Kennedy decided to go to Germany and run what we would characterize
                    in the US as a “political campaign” to try to bolster German morale. McGhee knew
                    of these plans when he arrived in May 1963 and decided almost immediately that
                    Lee could not leave until after the Kennedy visit. Lee was put in charge of the
                    “State Dinner.” He spent several months just doing that—every day, all day. It
                    was unbelievable the amount of time that went into that dinner! I moved to the
                    Ambassador's office about the same time that McGhee arrived and Alan and I
                    shared that small office thereafter with me doing the staff aide work and he the
                    dinner. I think Alan's efforts were a good illustration of the meticulousness
                    and care that went into President Kennedy's trip. I believe that that Kennedy
                    trip changed entirely the nature of Presidential trips and became the model for
                    subsequent Presidential trips to all overseas locations. I am not sure it was a
                    change for the better for anybody!</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McGhee's and my relationship was a disaster from the beginning. I had never met
                    him before he came to Bonn. The whole McGhee family came to Bonn—Cecile and
                    kids. My first real experience with the new Ambassador was on “Credential
                    Presentation” Day. I arrived at the Residence with a batch of papers which
                    Brewster Morris had told me to have ready for the Ambassador. McGhee took one
                    look at them and said that they were not the right ones. In fact, they weren't.
                    The party was to leave the Residence in about five minutes. I jumped in my
                    little Volkswagen, dashed to the Embassy and back in six minutes. But George was
                    already fuming, even though I got him the credentials in time for him to make
                    his presentation. When I say “fuming” I should have said “exploded”. That was
                    the first explosion which was followed by many others in the succeeding 13
                    months I worked for him. He never threw objects at me or anyone else, at least
                    in my presence. But he was mercurial. As a junior officer, I was just
                    thunder-struck by this man. No one had even treated me as McGhee did. I well
                    remember one time when McGhee literally was pulling his hair as he sat down at
                    his desk. Once having taken his chair, he took four pencils which were on his
                    desk and broke each, one by one. I don't remember the object of his outrage, but
                    when he was mad—which happened much too frequently—he was really mad.</p>
                <p>Many years later, at a wedding, I ran into Marty Hillenbrand. We talked about
                    George a little bit; I admitted that I had not perhaps performed as well as I
                    might have, but Marty told me that many had had the same experience. I said that
                    I had tried to satisfy him as best as I could, but I never was able to please
                    him. Marty then said: “You know, he was a megalomaniac.” I told him that I
                    hadn't known that, but that I could certainly testify that he behaved as
                    one.</p>
                <p>George was not happy with me, even though he kept me around for 13 months. My
                    recollection of those unhappy days was that things were constantly going wrong.
                    For example, at his request, I would arrange a trip to Munich for him that
                    aborted. (That was one of my principal tasks; he went on 52 trips during the 13
                    months I worked for him). Of course, I could always count on weather being bad
                    on the day he was scheduled to travel or some other equally uncontrollable
                    event. No matter what we did, there were always glitches of one kind or another.
                    I had two protocol assistants working for me and we still could barely keep up
                    with McGhee's travel demands.</p>
                <p>He also ran a hotel at the Residence; guests were continually coming and going
                    which added to our work-load. McGhee's secretary was an old hand in the Foreign
                    Service and very experienced in placing blame on someone else—usually me. Of
                    course, with the volume of activities that McGhee generated, the law of averages
                    would suggest that something would go wrong. He never remembered all the things
                    that were done right; he only raged at the mishaps. The trips to Berlin were
                    always a peril; there was a constant debate whether whatever went wrong was Bill
                    Ryerson's fault—he was stationed in Berlin—or mine. I would be the first to
                    admit that we did make mistakes at times, but very often McGhee's fury was just
                    unwarranted.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I remember one time when McGhee returned from a two week trip, during which all
                    had gone remarkably smoothly. He had gone through the Mediterranean with his
                    entire family. On his return, he exploded in my office because we had rented a
                    Volkswagen bus; I guess that was not good enough for George McGhee although I
                    don't know what else could have accommodated all the passengers that were with
                    him. Usually, I did not go on the trips with him, for which I was eternally
                    thankful. I did accompany him when he went to Berlin, but I could barely afford
                    that much time away from the office. We were a busy group just keeping up with
                    McGhee, keeping late hours every evening and weekends as well.</p>
                <p>McGhee's son was picked up once for a drug violation. It ran as a story in the
                    “Stars and Stripes”—the Army newspaper. George was fit to be tied and called the
                    CINC trying to get the editor fired. He was indeed a megalomaniac.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of my 13 months' “survival course”, Dan Shore and the New York
                    Times correspondent Art Olsen, took me aside at a party we were all attending.
                    They interviewed me for 20 minutes or more about George McGhee and my
                    relationship with him. In essence, I told them how he terrorized the
                    staff—people like Coburn Kidd who was a very fine officer. George in fact ended
                    Coburn's career. I remember Coburn coming into my office one day, accusing me of
                    doing something. In fact, he had his facts entirely wrong and Coburn went away,
                    somewhat mollified as far as I could see. But Coburn was lashing out at me
                    because McGhee had lashed out at him. I was not the only one that McGhee would
                    go after. He was unhappy with everybody, but since I was physically the closest
                    to him, I took more than my share of George's eruptions. I was almost physically
                    ill by the time the 13 months were up. I worried all the time; I did not do
                    well. George wrote a devastating efficiency report on me that almost ended my
                    career.</p>
                <p>There are several lessons that I learned from my experiences with George. The
                    first and most important was the absolute necessity to treat your staff as human
                    beings. McGhee's ravings and rantings were not very effective communication and
                    certainly he was not a leadership model. I told my wife that if I ever had
                    anyone working for me, I prayed that I would never behave like McGhee did.</p>
                <p>I did think that George was a “big time” operator—after all he had been an Under
                    Secretary of State which for a junior officer was rather awesome. He was a
                    stickler for good writing. One day, Dick Vine, who was the deputy chief of the
                    Political Section, delivered a draft message to McGhee. The Ambassador took it
                    with him in his car and I happen to be along watching McGhee breaking his lead
                    pencils as he worked furiously on the Vine draft, muttering all the time, he
                    couldn't understand how a senior foreign service officer could write so poorly.
                    Years later, I told Vine of that experience; he was not very fond of McGhee
                    anyway and that episode certainly did not bring forth any exclamations of
                    approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>As I said, McGhee traveled a lot and was highly visible in Germany. At Christmas
                    time, he would send out hundreds of cards to German friends and acquaintances.
                    He ran his ambassadorship as a public relations firm, which I think was probably
                    quite impressive to those who were out of range of his daily outbursts. He did
                    last for five years in Germany; I am not sure what the Germans thought of him
                    after his departure, but he certainly was a highly visible and active ambassador
                    while he was there. He only learned a few German phrases, but he was seen in
                    every corner of West Germany and Berlin. He also had lots of visitors; Jean
                    Monnet once came to see him—they were, I believe, old friends. I don't know
                    about his relationship with Adenauer or Erhard. Frankly, I was so inundated with
                    the minutiae of running McGhee's office that I didn't have time for many
                    observations. But as I said there was no question that McGhee operated at the
                    highest levels of the German and American governments.</p>
                <p>In the background of our relationships with the Germans, was always the specter
                    of Soviet interference in our linkages to West Berlin and in Germany in general.
                    They were very unpredictable. Sometimes, for example, they would permit us to
                    enter East Berlin on the subway. But I tried it once with Bill Ryerson and we
                    were turned back. So I never got to East Berlin. The same unevenness of policy
                    existed on the Autobahns; sometimes we would get through without any problems;
                    on others, we would be harassed. There were constant disputes with the Soviets
                    about minutiae of travel to Berlin across East Germany—flags on trains, etc. The
                    situation was certainly better than it was during the airlift, but we were
                    always quite wary of the Soviets; we never knew whether they would try to shut
                    us out of Berlin again. The Kennedy speech in 1963 in Berlin was in part
                    intended to warn the Soviets about our resolution and it was quite effective;
                    the picture of the President of the United States standing against the hated
                    wall and pledging his solidarity with the citizens of that city must have made a
                    deep impression on the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The Kennedy visit took place in the summer, 1963. He stopped at Cologne first,
                    where he visited the Cathedral. I remember that the head of the White House
                    Communications detail—an Army major—had set up telephones in the Cathedral. I
                    asked whether it was true that a phone had been placed in the pew behind the
                    President. He told me that it was only half true; in fact, two phones had been
                    placed there. In fact, all of Germany was wired with White House telephones.
                    That was just further evidence of the major effort that was undertaken to
                    support that Presidential trip. I don't believe that there were very many
                    substantive issues to be discussed between the President and the Chancellor. The
                    trip was primarily a campaign such as an American candidate engages in every
                    four years in the US. Kennedy was there to win “the hearts and minds” of the
                    German people and to boost their morale. So all the preparations were comparable
                    to a campaign swing, only on a much larger and grandiose scale. It was just
                    extraordinary. Every detail of Kennedy's appearances were discussed at great
                    length; all the scenarios were elaborately worked out—all intended to make the
                    best possible impression that could be staged.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>“Ich bin ein Berliner”—the famous remark that Kennedy made in Berlin—was the
                    culmination of his visit to Germany and was so designed. A million Germans in
                    the Rathaus Square heard him and it was certainly the pinnacle of a very
                    successful public relations trip.</p>
                <p>The advance work, as I said, was meticulous. The advance party and that group
                    that came with Kennedy was large, and I think this was the first Presidential
                    visit on that scale and that subsequent ones became increasingly demanding and
                    refined. The Reagan visit to Korea, which I managed for the Embassy many years
                    later, was on a grand scale, but the Kennedy trip to Germany became the model
                    for subsequent Presidential forays. All of the Kennedy stops went through “dry
                    runs” to insure a minimum potential for inadvertent mistakes. I understand the
                    Kennedy political campaign became the model for subsequent domestic political
                    campaigns; in the same way, his trip to Germany set the standards for subsequent
                    Presidential foreign visits. I can remember Reagan's advance team members
                    telling me in 1983(?) that Kennedy had redefined Presidential visits.</p>
                <p>The guide for the press for the German trip was 250 pages long. It was very
                    detailed, with each event described, second by second. I had a chance to
                    personally observe Kennedy in action. I was in the anteroom for that dinner that
                    Alan Lee spent so much time arranging. I saw Kennedy sitting in his special
                    chair which was intended to ease his back problems. Unfortunately, I did not go
                    to Berlin to hear his famous speech. I saw McGeorge Bundy, Richard Goodwin and
                    other staff members. I got into the middle of a McGeorge Bundy-Goodwin spat
                    because I happened to be the carrier of a speech draft that was being shuttled
                    between the two. I delivered the speech to Goodwin, who took one brief glance at
                    it and threw it into the wastepaper basket with an expletive.</p>
                <p>We managed to see a good deal of Germany in our two years there. I had been there
                    before in the Air Force. Quincy Lundsen, an A-100 classmate who was in the
                    Economic Section, and his wife and the Clevelands used to spend most weekends
                    castle-hopping and sightseeing.</p>
                <p>The physical change between my two tours in Germany was obvious. During my first
                    tour, there was still evidence in downtown Munich of air raids. (The German mark
                    then (1956) was still at an exchange rate that enabled me as a first lieutenant
                    to live better than all but a few Germans. We lived well even on our modest
                    salary.) But by 1956-57, the Germans were already hard at work reconstructing
                    their country. I remember traveling down to Munich on the train from Bremerhaven
                    during the middle of the night and observing Germans rebuilding their houses
                    under flashlight. They had worked all day and then returned home to fix their
                    war torn houses. By the time I came to Germany the second time, there was very
                    little war destruction still evident. The German standard of living was still
                    modest, but their spirits were high. They were convivial and slowly but surely
                    they were making progress. In the early 1960s, I was very interested in car
                    racing and therefore saw the Nurbergring races.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>As I have stated, the Germans were as concerned as we were about the Soviets. I
                    don't remember that any of us thought that WWIII was about to break out or that
                    we experienced any major crisis as arose during the airlift or the construction
                    of the Wall. But I think here was always an underlying concern about what the
                    Soviets might do, accompanied by a determination to stand fast against any
                    encroachments of the rights spelled out by international treaties. There was a
                    lot of “steadfastness,” and I think everybody was wary of possible “salami”
                    tactics—i.e. cutting back on treaty rights, however small, here and there. We
                    and the Germans had the sense that we would stand together and be firm.</p>
                <p>McGhee, as I said, spoke little if any German. But I did not interpret for him.
                    He used either the interpreter of the official with whom he was speaking or
                    someone from the Political Section, where we had some excellent German speaking
                    officers. I myself continued to study German every day for an hour. I used it
                    when I traveled through the country. I could go to an all-German party and
                    socialize in German; I could certainly understand 75-80% even when the
                    conversations went beyond the “small talk.” If I had had an opportunity to use
                    it in my official duties, I probably would have learned a lot more. For some
                    reason or other, I could never read it as well as I could speak it; I used to
                    read the “Frankfurter Allgemeine”, one of Germany's leading newspapers. I read
                    that more than others because I seemed to find it simpler in its writing style.
                    This was all for my own benefit however, not for the Ambassador. I worked
                    primarily on his trip schedules, visits, etc. and supervised the two protocol
                    secretaries. That was enough!</p>
                <p>I think it was less than a year after I arrived that Adenauer retired. My most
                    vivid memory of the “Old Man” was one night when I tried to cross the Rhine on a
                    ferry. Adenauer lived across the river from Bonn and had to cross it on a ferry.
                    When he went back and forth, of course, he was always escorted by a police
                    escort—both motorcycles and cars. This entourage getting on one of those ferries
                    was quite impressive. As I remember it, by the time the Chancellor and his
                    escorts got on, there wasn't room for the rest of us; we had to wait for the
                    next one. I thought: Well, he deserves all that. A great man, der Alte.</p>
                <p>In closing, I should say that I enjoyed my two years in Germany, but it was a
                    painful job experience in which I did not perform as well as I had hoped to,
                    although circumstances were not quite propitious. I did not leave a very good
                    impression on the Washington staff. Elwood Williams, who was the “father” of the
                    “German club” was not very helpful when it came to helping me with my next
                    assignment. I think by the end of my two years, Williams was anxious to have me
                    replaced and found Peter Semler, a college classmate, to become McGhee's special
                    assistant. Peter was the second of five officers who served as McGhee's aides in
                    the five years he was Ambassador in Bonn.</p>
                <p>Some years later, George McGhee hosted a party at his house in Georgetown to
                    which he invited all of his former Embassy staffers. I felt rather badly because
                    I accepted and actually went; I should have refused; but I was too polite, I
                    guess. But I did see all my successors and many of my colleagues from the Bonn
                    days.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964, you were assigned to the Fletcher School. How did
                        that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was at my request. I had for some time asked to be sent to graduate
                    studies to enhance my economic analysis skill. I felt that if my career were to
                    follow an economic course, I needed a better academic foundation. My request, I
                    think, made it easier for McGhee to ease me out of Bonn to be replaced by
                    Semler. I left Bonn in the summer of 1964.</p>
                <p>I was at Fletcher for the academic year 1964-65. The choice of Fletcher was the
                    Department's. The FSI officer in charge of economic training said to me, when we
                    first met, that I was not much of an officer and that he certainly would not
                    have chosen me for this advanced economic training. He added that he had been
                    requested to accept me and that he had prevailed on Fletcher to take me. He had
                    picked Fletcher because he thought it was the least demanding economic training
                    available—no statistics, no modeling, etc. Before sending us future students of
                    economics off to various universities, FSI put us through a month long
                    preparatory course—at which I did very well according to the instructor.</p>
                <p>I must say that the thought of going off to training after a bad efficiency
                    report—which, according to Foreign Service gossip is a very bad idea—never
                    entered my head. I was so happy to leave McGhee that I really wasn't worried
                    about the potential impact of training on my career. Furthermore, I looked
                    forward to returning to the academic world. I had done well going to Georgetown
                    in the evenings and I think I felt that a year at Fletcher would be good for my
                    self-esteem. I believed that a year's training in economics would be rewarding,
                    both intellectually and career wise. The choice was between a year at a
                    university or a year in language and area study, which was the customary choice
                    then for officers at my grade level. I came down on the side of the
                    university.</p>
                <p>The whole family moved to Wayland, MA—a little past Wellesley, near Lincoln. It
                    was a very nice community where we rented a little house. We enjoyed the year,
                    away from job pressures.</p>
                <p>I found Fletcher immensely useful. FSOs Herb Horowitz and Charlie York were also
                    there. Burt Levin and Don Born were at Harvard, but all of us Foreign Service
                    officers would get together and became friends. There were some military
                    officers at Fletcher whom we got to know. I worked very hard—harder than I had
                    at any university. For the first time in my life, I went to my “job” at 8 a.m.
                    and studied until 6 p.m. every day without a break. Rarely did I take any work
                    home at night; sometimes I would work on a weekend in preparation for exams, for
                    example. I put myself on a very disciplined track which I think was in part
                    responsible for my learning a lot. I did well and was very satisfied with my
                    experience at Fletcher. I found it personally very satisfying. My confidence was
                    rebuilt because I found out that I could survive in a tough intellectual
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I learned a lot about economics, but the course I remember the best was on
                    European diplomatic history—1815 to present. I wanted that course so that I
                    could get an M.A. I took six semester courses in economics—economic development,
                    national income theory, international trade—and three in diplomatic history. I
                    got an A in the history course—the first such high mark ever given by that
                    Professor—but I did spend a lot of time on it. I think that diplomatic history
                    course stood me in good stead for the rest of my Foreign Service career, not in
                    terms of applying any specific lessons, but as useful background to some of the
                    issues that confronted me. The 19th Century—Bismarck and Metternich—is a very
                    useful period to study for any diplomat, even if the structure which these
                    statesmen worked so hard to build fell apart after their deaths.</p>
                <p>The lessons learned in the economic course were also useful, especially since my
                    career at that stage had not yet developed well and the future was still
                    somewhat cloudy. As I said before, the year was very important in the rebuilding
                    of my self-confidence and I left Fletcher feeling much better about myself than
                    I had when I entered. I was reinvigorated, refreshed and ready for Jakarta which
                    was to be my next assignment.</p>
                <p>I must say that the FSI “shepherd”—Jacques Reinstein—was mystified by my interest
                    in Jakarta. He pointed out that there were “no statistics” in Indonesia; there
                    were no numbers to “crunch”. It never occurred me that that was an important
                    ingredient for economic analysis. I had become comfortable with economics at
                    Fletcher, at least as a “generalist” in the field. I had acquired enough
                    academic background to permit me to do the job in Jakarta without any great
                    difficulties. I was comfortable with economic concepts and ideas. I never
                    could—nor would I want to necessarily—be able to analyze statistical balances of
                    payment or national incomes or gross domestic products. I found that I never
                    really wanted that kind of expertise.</p>
                <p>After the Fletcher year, I headed back to Asia where I stayed for the rest of my
                    Foreign Service career. I think that opportunities for a young FSO, then and
                    now, were far greater in Asia than in places like Bonn, although my view may be
                    skewed by my unfortunate experience with McGhee. I could work on issues in Asia
                    that officers two grades higher were handling in Germany. Fletcher was a
                    marvelous experience enhanced by the birth of our fourth child, Peter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1965, you were assigned to Jakarta as an economic
                        officer. Was that at your request?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CLEVELAND: In light of my experience in Germany and at Fletcher, I wanted to a)
                    not be reassigned to Germany or to any European post; b) be assigned to East
                    Asia; and c) to be assigned to a position in an economic section. Personnel gave
                    me a list of upcoming vacancies that met my criteria, from which I chose the job
                    in Jakarta. I could have gone to Seoul; as I said before, Reinstein thought I
                    was crazy to go to Jakarta where they “didn't have any statistics.” I chose
                    Jakarta because unlike Seoul, the other possibility, the American Embassy staff
                    did not live in a compound, but lived in rented quarters in various parts of the
                    city. I had had enough “compound living” in Bonn; I wanted to experience living
                    among the local population. But I had never seen Jakarta—perhaps
                    fortuitously.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Embassy did rent us a small house in one of Jakarta's nice
                    residential neighborhoods—Kabeiren. The house was right near a mosque from which
                    prayers were broadcast at 5 a.m. every morning. We became friendly with some of
                    our Indonesian neighbors. Four or five weeks after the military coup occurred in
                    late September, 1965, we had six or seven tanks parked in a field right next to
                    our house. They were there essentially as a watchdog for the neighborhood. We
                    thought that the tanks would be gone in matter of days; in fact they remained
                    for two or three years. It didn't take us long before we began to provide
                    laundry service to the tank crews, as well as some food and other basics. The
                    maids in our house provided entertainment to the troops that was becoming quite
                    disruptive. So rather than complain to the command, we invited the whole tank
                    squad into the house for a big party. We become well acquainted and they became
                    wonderful neighbors for the years they stayed in that field. The tank men were
                    extremely polite and very nice and we enjoyed getting to know them. It is not a
                    practice that I would necessarily recommend for everybody, but it worked well
                    for us. Our kids every once in a while got to ride in the tanks. Those tanks
                    would periodically patrol the narrow streets on which we lived, knocking down
                    trees indiscriminately. Sometimes the kids would be on board during these
                    forays.</p>
                <p>Howard Jones was the Ambassador in the early ''60s, but he was already gone by
                    the time we arrived. He was succeeded by Marshall Green. The DCM was Frank
                    Galbraith, who soon left to be our Ambassador in Singapore and was replaced by
                    Jack Lydman. The Economic Counselor was Perry Ellis, who left soon after we
                    arrived to be replaced by Paul McCusker. There was one person USIS and a very
                    small trace still left of the 1950s and early ''60s assistance program. We had
                    had a huge AID mission, but it was for all intents and purposes thrown out of
                    the country by Sukarno. It was not until the coup several months after my
                    arrival that we resurrected the AID program and rebuilt the AID mission. It was
                    done on a much more modest level than had been true before, however.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The Economic Section consisted of four officers—Paul, Gordon Donald, Malcolm
                    Churchill—the most junior—and myself. Later Joe Havary was added as a Commercial
                    Attach�. Initially, my specific responsibilities were to report on oil and
                    mining. My first six months were almost exclusively devoted to oil, because the
                    two big American companies—CALTEX, STANVAC—had made large investments in
                    Indonesia and were being threatened with seizure. Later, my portfolio expanded
                    to other parts of the Indonesian economy, such as communications, which also
                    became a major area for US investment, aviation and Indonesian manufacturing. In
                    fact, I came to cover the supply side of the economy—one of the country's first
                    “supply siders.” And consequently my job eventually turned into an advisory
                    service for potential American investors, who began to look at Indonesia as a
                    possible base for investing, starting in early 1966.</p>
                <p>When Suharto came in, the pressures to throw out the two big American oil
                    companies eased. So I turned to helping some 56 American oil companies over the
                    next two years, as best I could, as they tried to get into exploration for oil.
                    The addition of the Commercial Attach� didn't decrease my work load. Joe Havary
                    was a terrific guy and we just worked together in all areas; there was so much
                    to do that there was never any time to worry about who was doing what; we worked
                    as a team. I specialized in oil and mining matters plus aviation and
                    communications, because I had spent so much time on them before Joe arrived.
                    But, as I said, there was more than enough to do and the two of us never
                    stumbled over each other. Paul McCusker personally handled some of the larger
                    deals—Freeport Sulfur's investment, for example. After the coup and with
                    Suharto's accession to power, the business climate in Indonesia turned positive
                    attracting many foreign investors, including American. We believed that it was
                    in our interest to have the Indonesians develop their economy. They had some
                    very fine economists, known as the “Berkeley Mafia” because they had gotten
                    their education at the University of California. The chief of this group was
                    Widjojo; there was Emil Salim and Ali Wardhana, Sadli, plus several others. This
                    group had been advisors to the Indonesian military before the coup. They had
                    convinced Suharto and the other generals that economic development was crucial
                    to Indonesia. When the military took power and overthrew Sukarno, this group of
                    economists became pivotal in the new government. They continue to be influential
                    to this day.</p>
                <p>The Embassy, after the coup, was definitely pushing US investment, not only
                    because we thought it would be good for American companies, but because we too
                    viewed Indonesian economic development as essential to political stability and
                    growth. As I said, we restarted an assistance program, but with a much lower
                    profile than had existed in earlier years. Marshall Green, after taking over as
                    Ambassador, developed the concept of helping the Indonesians through our AID
                    program to help themselves. In earlier years, we had just poured money and
                    American technicians into Indonesia to run development projects; we were of
                    course trying to assist indigenous economic development; but we were essentially
                    doing all the work and the Indonesians gained little. Green's view was that the
                    Indonesians should develop and manage the economic development programs and
                    projects themselves. We would provide such assistance as was appropriate, but we
                    stayed in the background primarily. Included of course in the range of economic
                    assistance was US private investment.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>There were areas in which our investors were in competition with other
                    foreigners. We in the Embassy promoted American firms. If there was more than
                    one American company interested in the same activity, we promoted all.</p>
                <p>There wasn't any promotion in the oil area. There was no need. We provided advice
                    to interested American firms; we briefed as thoroughly as we could on how things
                    operated in Indonesian oil and suggested various approaches depending on the
                    nature of their interests. I told each of the 56 oil representatives that I saw
                    during my tour that I would tell them all I knew, but that they would come to
                    know a lot more than I very soon as they began their negotiations with the
                    Indonesians. I only asked that they keep me informed of their progress or lack
                    thereof. That arrangement worked out well and I developed close relations with
                    many American oil people, enabling me to report a pretty accurate picture of the
                    Indonesian oil business for the rest of my tour. This was important stuff to
                    understand. There was a tremendous amount of investment that was made in the
                    Indonesian oil provinces; earnings from oil exploration and production became
                    the major foreign exchange return for the country. This has lasted until
                    today.</p>
                <p>Ironically the Dutch, and particularly Dutch Royal Shell which I believe was the
                    first discoverer of Indonesian oil, decided not to compete for new exploration,
                    even as Suharto came to power. That was a very curious development because Dutch
                    Shell had major interests in Indonesian Borneo. It also had a 145 mile long
                    pipeline in that area, but just as Suharto took power, the Dutch gave up and did
                    not compete for any other exploration rights. It was true that they had found
                    possible oil field in Sarawak and Sabah and they may have calculated that that
                    was as much as they could handle. They left the fields outside of Borneo to
                    other explorers. Perhaps they felt that they could not compete politically with
                    other foreigners; I don't know the reasons. We found the Dutch reticence
                    intriguing and I wrote a number of reports on that surprising development. I
                    suspect that by 1965, Royal Dutch Shell may simply have been fed up with
                    Indonesia. They had been treated very badly by Sukarno, as had others, but I
                    think the Dutch may have reached the outer limits of their tolerance before the
                    other foreigners did. They therefore missed the golden days of oil
                    exploration.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>As I said, there was no shortage of American interest. Our companies became the
                    dominant oil producers in Indonesia. CALTEX had been in Indonesia for long
                    time—even before WWII. By the mid 1960s it had known reserves in excess of 10-12
                    billion barrels, which is huge. Almost all of it was in Sumatra. STANVAC had
                    smaller operations, but later found major gas fields as well as other oil
                    fields. These American companies were well established in Indonesia and knew all
                    the players well. They had done their homework—geology—well, but the first real
                    exploration after Suharto's rise to power was really done by small American
                    exploration companies with relatively small amounts to invest. The first company
                    that I can remember that was successful was the Independent Indonesian-American
                    Petroleum Company (IIAPCO). The local representative—Don Todd—of that company
                    became a good friend. He was a geologist who felt that Indonesia had a huge oil
                    base; this was almost an emotional belief. He had begun to negotiate for
                    exploration rights in 1963—before Sukarno began pressuring the oil companies. In
                    1966 he finally negotiated a production sharing contract—the first of its kind
                    in Indonesia, or perhaps in the world.</p>
                <p>Todd understood the Indonesians and they respected him. To some oil companies on
                    the other hand, Todd reinforced their unhappiness with the new contracts that
                    were being negotiated. The old contracts, which had been negotiated by the large
                    firms, included such provisions as a 50/50 split of the profits after tax and
                    royalty. These contracts were very profitable for both sides. But the smaller
                    companies were willing to divide the oil at the well on a basis more favorable
                    to the Indonesians. In return, the Indonesians would then have to market the
                    crude.</p>
                <p>In many respects, these new contracts were more favorable to Indonesia and were
                    becoming a threat to those signed by the large companies. Caltex and Stanvac
                    would come to the Embassy and tell us their concerns; they never asked us to
                    intervene directly—nor would we have come between the Indonesian government and
                    the small oil explorers; It would have meant that we would be favoring one
                    American oil company over another. We used to give everyone our best advice, but
                    we told them negotiations with the Indonesians were their problem, not ours. The
                    situation was not unusual in the oil exploration industry world-wide. Armand
                    Hammer, as head of Occidental Petroleum, had broken some of the standard
                    contracts that the majors had negotiated in the Middle East. The same thing
                    happened in Indonesia; a smaller American company submitted a contract that was
                    somewhat better for the Indonesians which broke that pattern established by the
                    majors many years before. Todd may very well have counseled the newcomers on his
                    production sharing contract, which over time became the model for subsequent
                    contracts for all oil companies—large and small—doing business in Indonesia. The
                    history of the oil industry has basically been one of a continuing diminishing
                    advantage that the big firms had initially built into their contracts. The
                    increasing benefits to the host countries was repeatedly met with strong
                    protests from the majors who held the position, year after year, that the new
                    provisions would make exploration and exploitation of the oil fields
                    unprofitable. As far as I know, however, no major oil company ever went broke
                    even under new contract provisions!</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The second largest investment opportunity for foreign investors in Indonesia in
                    the mid-1960s was mining. Indonesia is immensely rich in natural resources.
                    Foreign investors offered opportunities in the mineral area which were
                    financially very attractive to Indonesia. They brought extraction processes that
                    had the advance technology the Indonesians didn't have. So the foreign
                    investment focus on the mineral extraction industry made eminent sense for the
                    Indonesian economy, which their experts and ours readily perceived.</p>
                <p>As in most such situations, there was some resentment about foreigners coming
                    into Indonesia to pull out “their birthright”. I don't think the Indonesians
                    were unique in this matter; this resentment, whether virulent or just under the
                    surface, has been known to exist in many parts of the world. But, despite
                    Sukarno's departure from the scene, the Suharto regime was not exactly a model
                    of democracy as we know it; the country was still under tight central control.
                    When the government reached a decision that some activity was in the national
                    interest, there was not much opportunity for other point of views. I am pretty
                    sure that there was resentment in the population; we used to hear complaints
                    about some of the new ventures from the opposition. But there was no vocal
                    public outcry about mineral exploration. The Army was in control then as it is
                    still today. And that was that.</p>
                <p>Let me just speak a little about the coup—Gerakan Tigah Puluh, on the 30th of
                    September. I arrived in Indonesia at the beginning of July, 1965. At the time,
                    the US was apparently more disliked in Indonesia than almost anywhere in the
                    world. Whether this was a deeply felt popular view or whether it was imposed
                    from the top, I can not say. As in most countries, the Indonesians took their
                    cues from the political leadership; the population followed whatever winds were
                    favorable to them. That was not unusual; we find obedient populations in many
                    parts of the world. The anti-American feeling was undoubtedly whipped up by
                    certain leadership groups, as the pro-American sentiment which surfaced after
                    the coup was encouraged by the new leadership. In fact, I think the Indonesian
                    masses were probably far more concerned about their personal economic problems
                    than the political whims of the leadership, which they followed as the safest
                    path.</p>
                <p>In any event, the Embassy was daily pelted with stones in the summer of 1965. The
                    Chancery was next door to the State House where Subandrio, the Foreign Minister,
                    would hold forth in his demagogic way about the evils of the US. The crowd would
                    then march next door and throw stones at the Chancery. Marshall Green used to
                    have a couple of dirty old rocks and some slick marble pieces on his coffee
                    table, which he would show visitors. The marble pieces had been thrown when
                    Howard Jones was the Ambassador. Marshall would report; the rocks had been
                    thrown through his own windows. Marshall used to point to the differences as an
                    indicator on how the Indonesian economy had deteriorated!</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So our initial year in Jakarta was scary or exciting depending on your
                    perspective. I was still a novice and thought that those days were fascinating.
                    But Sukarno took every opportunity to paint us as devils. The atmosphere was so
                    tense that we didn't have much contact with Indonesians, either because they had
                    been ordered not have any contacts with the Americans or because they were
                    afraid to do so. That was frustrating, because, as I said earlier, I was anxious
                    to become better acquainted with foreigners. So the first year in Jakarta was
                    not very rewarding from that point of view; only a couple of Indonesian were
                    brave enough to sustain contact.</p>
                <p>The immediate events of September 30, 1965 and the days after were
                    extraordinarily interesting to me, and remain so to this day, even though I was
                    not a political officer then. I did not have any forewarning of what might
                    happen on September 30. Although some of the higher echelons in the Embassy may
                    well have, I believe that there was general surprise that a coup was taking
                    place. It took the Embassy a while to put all the pieces together. The first I
                    personally heard of it was when I entered the Chancery lobby early the morning
                    after. Bob Rigney, the Assistant Air Attach� and a friend, was there explaining
                    to people that he had heard shots behind his house which was very close to the
                    residence of the Chief of the Air Force. Others in the lobby had also heard
                    unusual sounds. Over the period of the next couple of hours, all sorts of
                    reports began to filter in—generals having been abducted, Nasution—the Chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs—escaping from the back of his house.</p>
                <p>Eventually it became clear that the communists, probably in cahoots with Sukarno,
                    had tried to overthrow the Army and kill its leadership. They did in fact kill
                    seven of the top generals, but did not catch General Suharto. At the time,
                    Suharto was commanding a division in Bandung. After the attempted overthrow, he
                    rallied his troops and moved them to Jakarta. He set up headquarters on the west
                    side Merdeka Square; Sukarno's people were on the east side of the square; the
                    Presidential Palace was on the north side. The American Embassy was (and is) on
                    the square as well—on the south. The feuding parties began their negotiations
                    around the square. Suharto had taken control of the radio station on the first
                    night, so that the news to the population was obviously one-sided. In any case,
                    the negotiations began virtually under our noses. That was a fascinating
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>At no time during this tense period, was our access to the Chancery impeded that
                    I recall. We kept our normal working hours—early morning to late at night. On
                    the morning of the first day, of course, Suharto was not anywhere near Jakarta;
                    it was only later that fighting began around the communication facilities in the
                    center of Jakarta. I think I personally was naive and simply felt a sense of
                    excitement stemming from the rapidly changing situation; I had no sense of
                    personal danger, although we all recognized that the course of coups was
                    unpredictable. I went down to Glodok, the Chinese quarters, a day or two after
                    the coup started. I was startled and impressed by how the quarter had been
                    festooned with red banners; they hung everywhere. I had not been anywhere before
                    where communism had shown such a public face. It was a worrisome sight. The
                    flags did not stay up long however. As soon as Suharto moved into Jakarta, the
                    communists disappeared. Throughout, the Embassy people moved around the city
                    pretty much at will; we attended the funeral for the assassinated generals and
                    other public events. In fact, I don't think it took the Army very long to
                    reestablish its control; the funeral was a major political event indicating the
                    reassertion of Army control.</p>
                <p>After Suharto and the Army reestablished control, a greater measure of calm
                    returned to Jakarta. In early October, all the Embassy dependents were evacuated
                    as a precautionary move. Carter and our four children went to Australia, from
                    whence I retrieved them in April, 1966, after spending a couple of weeks there
                    myself, seeing lots of old friends. The evacuation went as well as could be
                    expected. We used commercial transportation primarily. October 1965 in Indonesia
                    was not a time of great concern for our lives, as I have suggested earlier. It
                    was not like other places which we had to evacuate when American lives were in
                    imminent danger. There were tensions, worries and concerns, but I don't think I
                    felt that my own life was in great peril. As a mater of fact, Marshall Green did
                    not want the families evacuated. He did not see threats aimed at Americans; it
                    was the Chinese and Communist Indonesians who were “under the gun”. Many of them
                    were killed, although an accurate account has never been published, nor will
                    there ever be one. So Marshall argued for keeping families in Jakarta, primarily
                    as a morale boost for the employees. But the Department asked whether the
                    Embassy could “guarantee the safety” of the Americans—primarily official
                    families, since there weren't many private American citizens in Indonesia. That
                    of course was impossible, and therefore the families were evacuated. They went
                    to Singapore and Bangkok and eventually most went to the US.</p>
                <p>As exciting as the political events were, I remained professionally deeply
                    involved in oil issues, trying to resolve problems that CALTEX and STANVAC
                    faced. I was also following the doings of Royal Dutch Shell. Of course, my
                    colleagues in the Political Section kept me abreast of the major political
                    developments, but I was absorbed by my own work. One of the reasons why the
                    American Embassy was so deeply involved in existing and potential American
                    investments was necessity. By late 1965, there were no other American
                    institutions left in Indonesia—no American banks, no corporations, no American
                    Chamber of Commerce. Only a few Americans who were working for the existing oil
                    companies were left in Indonesia. And the Embassy. We had to work and help.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I should say that it was not immediately clear after the coup that Suharto and
                    his cohorts were going to be any friendlier to the American oil companies than
                    their predecessors had been. But I was charged to do my best to help the oil
                    companies to “stay in the game.” We should remember that the events of September
                    30 and the days that followed are best described as a “rolling” coup. Sukarno
                    was not immediately thrown out as President. Many of the bureaucrats that had
                    been appointed by Sukarno remained in their jobs. Suharto's final political
                    victory was still many months away, so that it was not clear to any of us how
                    this struggle would eventually end.</p>
                <p>It soon became increasingly clear to Marshall Green and the Embassy political
                    officers that Suharto was winning the battle, but it was not until a few months
                    after September 30, that Suharto—I think with Green's encouragement—decided that
                    the American oil companies and American investment and aid were necessary to
                    Indonesia's development. So there was a hiatus of several months during which
                    the oil companies were not sure of their future. We felt from the beginning of
                    Suharto's influence that the American trained economists would see the benefits
                    of US investment and had high hopes that they would swing Suharto and his
                    entourage to their point o view. But, as I said, it was three or four months,
                    December 1965 I believe, before Suharto finally reached that decision. The top
                    echelons of the Embassy were certainly pushing the value of US aid and
                    investment.</p>
                <p>The Embassy of course welcomed the change from Sukarno to Suharto. The former—and
                    his cohorts—had been as difficult a leader as we had to contend with around the
                    world. We had been greatly concerned abut Indonesia going communist. That would
                    have been a real blow to us in the mid-1960s as we were entering into our major
                    effort in Vietnam. So Indonesia was viewed as a very central if lower profile
                    issue in the struggle between communism and free world. The Suharto victory was
                    received with great relief. Our relationship with Indonesia took a 180% turn.
                    After the end of 1965, we had access to Indonesians, thereby enabling us to
                    better assess both economic and political developments and to engage
                    effectively. Also the country began to open up, particularly after the
                    limitation on diplomatic travel was lifted in April, 1966. That enabled Bob
                    Rigney to be the first to travel out of Jakarta. Dick Howland and I were the
                    second pair out. We traveled all across Java from Jakarta to Surabaya and back
                    by car.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Gradually the attitude of the Indonesian bureaucrats changed. Gordon Donald, the
                    number two officer in our Economic Section, knew the “Berkeley Mafia.” One day
                    he told me he wanted to introduce me to an Indonesian friend. He took me to a
                    house near the Embassy; there, on the porch, sat a white haired man,
                    nevertheless rather young, who turned out to be Widjojo. I left that
                    conversation impressed by the man's intellect and rationality—until then, I had
                    not met many “rational” Indonesians. So we knew that if the “Berkeley Mafia”
                    could be put in positions of influence, that among other things American
                    investments would be welcomed. And that is in fact what happened. By the end of
                    1965 or early 1966, Suharto made the decision to allow the oil companies to
                    stay. It was a welcome decision because the American oil people, with whom I met
                    constantly during this hiatus, were understandably quite nervous. As I said, the
                    Americans decided to stay; the Dutch decided to leave.</p>
                <p>I have to underscore that there was considerable difference between our efforts
                    to keep the American oil companies in Indonesia and our efforts to bring new
                    ones in. For the first six months of my tour, I devoted all my attention to
                    helping the existing American oil companies in Indonesia. The following two and
                    a half years of my assignment were devoted increasingly to new investments. I
                    think new oil companies seeing what the experience of CALTEX and STANVAC had
                    been decided to try their luck in Indonesia; we made no effort to attract new
                    investments, but as I said, there was a steady stream of interest starting in
                    the Spring, 1966 and for the next few years. Don Todd was my first new customer;
                    he was followed by Bryan Ebee, an older man, who had been an employee of US
                    Shell for many years, oddly enough. When he came to see me, it was, I believe,
                    as the representative of ZAPATA—a large off-shore platform builder—in which
                    George Bush had an interest. Then came a steady stream—UNION and CONOCO, etc—all
                    looking for oil. I guess the word was getting around in the oil circles that
                    Indonesia was the place to be. Indonesia had been a major oil producer even
                    before WWII and the only thing that had kept it from really prospering after the
                    war was the political situation. There was never any doubts that oil could be
                    found in the archipelago. The same thing could be said for mining prospects. The
                    availability of ore was never questioned; only the country's political stability
                    and attitude towards foreign investment were in doubt.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Starting in the late Spring 1966, all kinds of Americans began to trickle into
                    Indonesia. They came in increasing numbers. It became a subject for discussion
                    in the Embassy because we had come to the conclusion that almost every kind of
                    American was beginning to come to Indonesia—Bunker Hunt, Roy Huffington and
                    other Presidents of major US corporations. I met some of them in my office and
                    some in Paul McCusker's office. But then there were the adventurers and con men.
                    Some caused us some trouble. One for example was named John F. Kennedy, if you
                    can believe that. He insisted to all Indonesians who would listen that he was a
                    close relative of the former President. He built a fairly large structure—an
                    office building that he was putting up on spec—across from the Hotel Indonesia.
                    It was about half way up before the Indonesians found out that he was a complete
                    fraud and perhaps even a criminal. As the Indonesians began to close in on him,
                    he suddenly disappeared. The building stayed half erected for many years. So we
                    had a large number of unsavory characters trying to make their fortune in
                    Indonesia. They misled the Indonesians and certainly did nothing to enhance
                    American reputation.</p>
                <p>The biggest single incident of that kind of fraud in which I was personally
                    involved did not concern an American. A major bidding war took place in 1967
                    among several companies for the rights to mine the lateritic nickel deposits in
                    Sulawesi—an immense deposit. Among the bidders were: International Nickel,
                    headquartered in NY, although registered as a Canadian company; Kaiser Nickel—a
                    French-American joint venture; and Sumitomo. Japanese. In the course of that
                    bidding, Kaiser raised questions about the propriety of the Embassy's role in
                    the process. It believed that we were supporting International Nickel, which was
                    not true. I told Tom Singer, from Kaiser, that I would offer him exactly the
                    same advice and assistance that I would somebody from International Nickel,
                    which was more than � owned by Americans. And in fact I did. The fact was that
                    Phil Jessup and Bill Bell of INCO showed up ten times as often as Singer did,
                    which may have made it seem that we were leaning towards INCO.</p>
                <p>The competition was decided at technical levels by the Ministry of Mines in favor
                    of INCO. Then the real battle began. I didn't realize what was about to happen,
                    being rather new at this game. Kaiser-Nickel offered to build some
                    projects—waterworks, etc—as political bribes, if the political decision makers
                    would reverse the technicians. Bell went to the Canadian Ambassador—Olivier—who
                    was absolutely no help, although INCO was really a Canadian company. One
                    evening, Bell came to see me, quite upset with the French for trying to win the
                    bid with bribes. I suggested that we go see Marshall Green, which we did at his
                    Residence. Bill Bell explained the situation as he saw it. Marshall became as
                    angry as he ever got. When asked what he should do, we advised him to see the
                    Indonesian government officials, which he did. He went to see Sudomo Umardani, a
                    key military officer with direct access to Suharto.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>This bid for mineral exploration rights was essentially the first large contract
                    that the new Suharto government was going to sign. It was worth $1 billion
                    approximately, which in 1967 was a huge amount. Marshall told Umardani that if
                    the technical level decision were overturned, it could cast a long shadow over
                    any future investment considerations which would be a real set back for
                    Indonesia. Marshall's strong argument took Umardani by surprise. His
                    representations were duplicated by the Economic Section; we all went to our
                    contacts with the same argument. All our arguments, but mostly Marshall Green's
                    of course, I think helped carry the day. The Indonesian leadership upheld the
                    technical findings and recommendations, and INCO won the contract.</p>
                <p>The Kaiser people then went to the State Department and complained vigorously
                    about the Embassy and its involvement in a “private” matter, but there really
                    weren't grounds for their complaints. If anything, Kaiser should have been
                    berated for trying to win a contract by bribery. We weren't taking sides. All we
                    were really doing was defending the decision that the technical levels had
                    reached; it would have been a real blow to Indonesia had the decision gone in
                    another direction. We were defending the integrity of the bidding process so
                    that future potential investors would not be concerned by any hanky-panky and
                    could feel comfortable investing in Indonesia. It was very important that the
                    Indonesians understand the importance of the perception of an honest bidding
                    process to the future of investment in their country. I am not sure they
                    necessarily remembered the lesson forever, or even for long, but at least in
                    this case, the final judgement was technically and ethnically defensible.</p>
                <p>I suspect that even in those days, French companies were making “under the table”
                    offers. The waterworks offer to Makassar was clearly a political bribe—if not a
                    cash one—because the Trade Minister would have been the beneficiary of the
                    project that the French were willing to build in his district. And he was one of
                    the key decision makers on the nickel project. Bribery was rampant during
                    Sukarno's regime. I don't really know whether the new military (Suharto)
                    government reduced that kind of activity; it may have but it is very hard to
                    document. But it was always assumed that a certain amount of bribery was taking
                    place. Paul McCusker had a close friend, Vladimir Gold—a Czech/American—who was
                    close to the Indonesian Central Bank's President. Vladimir had extensive
                    knowledge of bribes which he used to report to us—except (I assume) for any
                    amounts that he himself might have skimmed off. So in general we had a pretty
                    good general picture of “the under the table” activities taking place in
                    Indonesia. But I am not sure that during this early period, bribery was an
                    overwhelming factor in commercial transactions. Someone who had been in Korea
                    thought the Indonesians were minor league compared to the Koreans. I don't
                    believe that bribery in Indonesia was out of line from that taking place in East
                    Asia in general, where that type of activity is much more part of the culture
                    than it is in the West.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The oil area, which took much of my time, also undoubtedly included bribery, but
                    there was also much more irregular activity than that involved. This was an
                    important situation which colored a lot of foreign investment in Indonesia.
                    General Ibnu Sutowo was in charge of Indonesia's oil activities. He reported
                    directly to Suharto. I was warned about Sutowo by some of my Indonesian
                    contacts. From the day he was appointed, he began to make himself an independent
                    political/economic power and built his own fiefdom, which we thoroughly reported
                    to Washington. PERTAMINA—the Indonesian government oil company that he led—hired
                    bodyguards with the uniforms and equipment of a regular army. He built a
                    civilian “air force” of considerable magnitude which he used to fly people all
                    over the country. At a later stage, he began to try to acquire some old tankers
                    from the Dutch—which would have given him a small army, air force and navy as
                    well. He became very powerful. He did not, I was told by American oil men,
                    solicit payments personally. He established an insurance company in Hong Kong.
                    If any oil company wanted to do business in Indonesia, it had to buy insurance
                    from this Hong Kong company. That was a very lucrative business, but that was
                    apparently only one of his ancillary industries. Needless to say, Ibnu Sutowo
                    became extraordinarily wealthy and an independent political power. It was no
                    news to the Indonesians economists that this was happening; it was a concern to
                    them because they understood that the major foreign exchange earner for
                    Indonesia was the oil business which was controlled by Ibnu, reporting directly
                    to Suharto. That is not a process with which a professional economist is
                    comfortable. Ibnu was probably completely unconcerned by the macroeconomic
                    impact of his empire. I must say that it was the general perception that much of
                    PERMTAMINA's profits were being channeled through the Army into the economic
                    development of Indonesia, but it was not a process that was under the control of
                    anyone but Ibnu and Suharto. I used to discuss these issues with reporters like
                    Bob Keatley of the “Wall Street Journal” and he wrote some reports on these
                    Indonesian practices.</p>
                <p>I was professionally concerned about this informal process as well as other
                    schemes that grew up as foreign investment in Indonesia poured in. Long after I
                    left, Ibnu Sutowo overplayed his hand and was fired by Suharto. At the time I
                    was there, my advice to Marshall Green was to avoid Ibnu Sutowo. He was not a
                    savory person with whom the American Ambassador should be associated, in my
                    view, even if he was a forceful and effective manager. His personal
                    aggrandizement was not the model that we should have encouraged in Indonesia by
                    being seen with him. Marshall never did. I must say that after 1968, Ambassador
                    Frank Galbraith and Colonel George Benson of the MAAG did have contacts with
                    Sutowo; I thought that was unfortunate, but it was probably more realistic.</p>
                <p>I am not sure that PERTAMINA was unique; there were probably other industrial
                    power centers developing, such as the tin mining business, etc. Most likely,
                    each of these major ore extracting business had one Indonesian “shepherd” who
                    took advantage of the opportunity to help himself. But Ibnu Sutowo was I think
                    the leader of the pack...because oil was so big.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Before making further comments, I should point out at this stage of my career
                    that I was pretty callow. I had finished my apprenticeship in the Foreign
                    Service—with some rough spots that I have described. My assignment to Indonesia
                    was that of a journeyman reporting officer; I was learning my craft in Jakarta,
                    and I think I was coming along. I still had some idealism in me, however. What I
                    found in Indonesia—the empires built by people like Ibnu Sutowo, the corruption,
                    the inefficiencies—always took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what I
                    expected, but much of what I saw in Indonesia was an eye-opener.</p>
                <p>This was my first assignment to a country under a military dictatorship. That was
                    also novel to me. Marshall Green was instrumental in shaping my views on issues
                    such as that which I hold still. Marshall's view was that the first generation
                    of Southeast Asia leaders, like Sukarno, had been nationalists whose goals were
                    the establishment of independent nations. Sukarno must be given credit for
                    achieving Indonesia's independence from Holland and for forming one nation out
                    of a number of disparate islands. But his political agenda did not include
                    economic development; few if any of the first generation Southeast Asia leaders
                    had given much thought beyond independence.</p>
                <p>Economic development was left to the second generation of leadership. That
                    required qualified technocrats and in Indonesia's case, it was fortunate enough
                    to have them. It was the technocrats who were able to look to the long range
                    future and were able to develop their plans unencumbered by the exigencies of
                    the moment. In Indonesia, these technocrats included the generals, who had
                    become engineers and builders and who had been smart enough to surround
                    themselves with people, like Widjojo and the “Berkeley Mafia.” They had heard
                    these economists at their War College in Bandung, and when the generals came to
                    power, they quickly brought these economists into posts of influence. Even
                    generals like Ibnu, despite his personal predilection, was a great manager and
                    used the economists to maximize the exploitation of oil for the benefit of his
                    country.</p>
                <p>We understood that the military was not forming democratic institutions, but with
                    their focus on economic development there is no doubt in my mind that Indonesia
                    needed Suharto and those generals at that stage of the country's development. A
                    military, with an appreciation of the importance of economic development, can be
                    useful to that process in a Third World country. I think that in the late 20th
                    Century, some countries need strong central control to marshall their human
                    resources—bureaucracy, industry, farmers, etc—to foster as rapid development as
                    possible. I think it is not appropriate to measure Third World development
                    against the earlier experiences of Europe and the US. They developed in
                    different times and places. The US did not have examples outside its geographic
                    area which could be used as models of development. The Industrial Revolution was
                    native to England and Western Europe; the opening of the West was native to the
                    US. We developed on our own—albeit more slowly.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>That is not true of the Third World today. The countries of Africa and Asia have
                    the West and the US helping them to move ahead in order to close the economic
                    gap between North and South. Furthermore, the populations of the Third World
                    have access to the economically developed world and have a model which they wish
                    to emulate as rapidly as possible. I suggest that these Third World countries
                    can afford to achieve rapid economic development even at the cost of some
                    political freedom. The direction provided by strong central governments is most
                    likely the avenue which will accelerate economic development the most. This
                    trade-off—repression in exchange for hopes of a rapidly rising standard of
                    living—is not always, in all cases, desirable, but I think many of the Third
                    World populations feel that the short term pain is worth it if the long range
                    economic gains are realized. I ran into this dilemma in Korea later on, where I
                    think the trade-off was consciously and correctly made by the Koreans.</p>
                <p>The debate about Sukarno's dictatorship in the Embassy in Jakarta was quite acute
                    before I arrived in 1965. By the time Marshall Green took over, however, the
                    tensions had pretty well dissipated. Marshall himself was such a great leader
                    that there were no internal frictions in the Embassy. Aside from his brilliance
                    and professional insight, Green's puns and humor were instrumental in
                    maintaining cohesion in the Embassy. When he first arrived, the Embassy staff
                    was invited to the Residence. When we got there, we found that there were
                    already 3 or 4 thousand Indonesians in the square in front of the Residence.
                    They had signs, along the lines “Green, go home.” Marshall was somewhat
                    startled, having just arrived. He started that day—and still does today—to refer
                    to these demonstrators as “Gringos.” He said that despite this unfriendly
                    welcome, he took heart because at the bottom of one of the signs there was
                    written in lipstick:”.....and take me with you.” That was a sign to him that
                    eventually he would be welcomed.</p>
                <p>There are numerous stories about Marshall Green. He is one of the heroes of the
                    Foreign Service. One day, I took some mining people to see the Ambassador. I was
                    the note taker and was busy doing so. But with Marshall, once you got to know
                    him, you could feel when he was about to make one of his famous puns. On that
                    day, at the end of the meeting, as people were saying goodbye, Marshall stopped
                    them and said: “Gentlemen, just a minute please before you leave. I have been
                    thinking about your mining prospects. Freeport Sulfur I notice is out here
                    looking for copper, US Steel is out looking for bauxite; Anaconda Copper is here
                    looking for tin. The trouble with you people is that no one is mining their own
                    business.”</p>
                <p>Whatever of substance he had told them, the miners remembered that pun. Marshall
                    had a tremendous intellect that could make a point in a very unusual way. His
                    wit got him into trouble a little later, however, when he told Stanley Karnow
                    that “he knew what we were doing in Cambodia; we were widening down the war.”
                    Karnow printed that without attribution, but the substitution of the word
                    “widening” for “winding” immediately pointed to Marshall. Henry Kissinger
                    reportedly knew where the leak had come from. No one else in the US Government
                    could have coined a phrase like that. But Green's immense intellect and wit,
                    bolstered by tremendous spirit and energy, was a unifying force for the Embassy
                    in Jakarta and an inspiration to me personally.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I had met Marshall just once before when I was in Canberra; he and his wife Lisa
                    had come down to Australia. Australia held a life long fascination for Marshall;
                    I think he was happy to conclude his Foreign Service career as Ambassador to
                    that country. On that early visit, he had blown through the Embassy like a
                    whirlwind; so that is how I remembered him.</p>
                <p>I might just add that in terms of my own personal development, I felt I was an
                    apprentice in the Foreign Service until I was assigned to Jakarta. The early
                    period was not a period that I remember with any great relish, particularly the
                    Bonn assignment which came close to ending my career then and there. Jakarta was
                    a tremendous opportunity; I grew professionally there. I found that I was
                    interested in reporting and writing and although ostensibly an economic officer,
                    I was reporting on political economic matters—mining, oil and the politics
                    thereof. I began to develop a writing style which I think enabled me to
                    communicate quite well with readers. I also began to think in broad terms,
                    putting the immediate experience in broader contexts; i.e. feudal baronies at
                    the center of economic development; the impact of briberies of all sorts on a
                    government. But not only the limitations: the ability of Suharto's military
                    dictatorship, using well trained economists, to bring order, stability and
                    development to a chaotic situation was apparent. Furthermore, I began to
                    understand that it was the role of an American embassy to assist American
                    business—that is a theme that became increasingly important to me in my later
                    assignments. The American business community comprises a very influential part
                    of the power that the US is able to exert in different foreign countries. That
                    led me to the conclusion that an embassy should aid American business
                    ventures—not always obviously and not blindly—but as a tool of US foreign
                    policy. All of these views emerged and were strengthened by my Jakarta
                    experience. So I consider that assignment to have been pivotal to my career and
                    my own life. I think back on it as being one of two most important assignments
                    along with Korea. It was a great maturing experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I must say, though, that by the end of my tour in Jakarta, I had had my fill of
                    economic assignments. The Department however, had different views; it wanted to
                    use my Indonesian experience and assigned me to the Office of Fuels and Energy
                    in the Bureau of Economic Affairs in Washington. I would have preferred to work
                    on the Indonesia desk or some other assignment with more political content in
                    the East Asia Bureau. During early days in the Foreign Service, I always
                    intended to follow the footsteps of my older cousins, Stanley—an economic
                    officer in the Foreign Service—Harlan and Van, who had been deeply involved in
                    the Marshall Plan. As time progressed I hoped to move out of the economic
                    specialty, however. I wanted to become a political officer. That view was
                    reinforced by my Indonesian experience, which, as I suggested, called for more
                    political than economic analysis. I never felt very confident as an “economist”;
                    Gordon Donald and the more junior Mal Churchill knew a lot more about
                    macro-economics—GDP, balance of payments, foreign exchange, etc.—than I did. I
                    did not need to have that statistical background for my job in Indonesia; I was
                    comfortable dealing with the supply side of an economy, but the issues that I
                    had to analyze were more often than not political rather than economic. That
                    reinforced my desire to move into the political “cone” so that I could study how
                    people acted and reacted. How governments operated and how to deal with them on
                    political and security issues.</p>

                    years. The assignment did not come as a complete shock because after my
                    experience in Jakarta, there was some logic to assigning me to “Fuels and
                    Energy.” But I also expected that the Department would sooner rather than later
                    honor my request to move to the political side of the house. In the 1960s, just
                    because an officer had been sent to economic training that did not necessarily
                    dictate that he or she would be in the economic field forever. I understood that
                    I would have to serve some time doing economic work, but I certainly did not see
                    myself carving out a long-range career in that field. The “cone” process by the
                    mid-1960s had not yet calcified so that it was still quite flexible and changing
                    from one field of expertise to another was not unusual.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>My boss in the Office of Fuels and Energy was Jim Akins, who was quite an
                    interesting character, as I found out and as Henry Kissinger and others found
                    out later. First of all, Akins was brilliant; he was one of the smartest people
                    I ever met. He might have phrased it even more strongly. There was always a
                    trade-off with Akins. Soon after I reported for duty, Jim gave me his basement
                    parking permit; I had to travel a long way and he lived much closer to the
                    office than I did and he walked to the office in the morning. But in exchange
                    for the permit, I drove him home every evening. One evening—I will never forget
                    this experience—as I was chauffeuring Jim home and was approaching Mass Avenue,
                    he turned to me and said suddenly that he had never had anybody work for him who
                    was as smart as he was. “Oh,” I said. “Interesting.” I was not about to argue
                    the point; for all I knew, it may have been correct. But then he added: “As a
                    matter of fact, I have never worked for anybody as smart as I am.” That was Jim
                    Akins! He was intellectually arrogant.</p>
                <p>But he was also fascinating in many ways and taught me some things about the oil
                    business. He introduced me to Ed Levy who was the “guru” of the oil consulting
                    business. I learned about other aspects of the oil business that I had not seen
                    or known about in Jakarta—the more dubious side of the big American oil company
                    operations, which took advantage of producers or competitors. I am not referring
                    to any illegal acts, but simply activities that seem somewhat questionable. I
                    learned a lot about the history of the oil industry—i.e. how extraction
                    companies, like ARAMCO, used to take 90% of the revenues, which by 1968 had been
                    dramatically reduced. I learned about oil pricing—how it was determined, how
                    rewarding it was for the oil companies, even when their share was down from 90%
                    to less than 50%.</p>
                <p>Most of my time in Fuels and Energy was devoted to oil, particularly developments
                    in East Asia and Latin America. Jim and the other two staff members spent their
                    time on Middle East issues. East Asia meant primarily Indonesia.</p>
                <p>I must say Jim had a broad understanding of oil all over the world, although his
                    expertise was on the Middle East in general where he had already spent some
                    time. He was moreover a clairvoyant about what might happen to the oil business.
                    He foresaw the development of OPEC into a major commercial power, able to force
                    up the price of oil. In 1970, he predicted that oil prices—at the time the price
                    was $1.32 posted for light Arabian crude although it actually sold for a
                    discount at $1.19 per barrel—would rise to $4-5 dollars per barrel. There was no
                    one, either in the government or the industry, that agreed with Jim; everyone
                    tried to disparage the notion. Of course as it turned out, Jim had
                    underestimated the steep rise. Oil prices rose to $12 per barrel and today is
                    near $20, after having come down from over $30 after the “oil shock”. Jim was
                    absolutely right when he predicted that OPEC would eventually dictate the price
                    of oil.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Jim got deeply involved in preparing an oil import plan as a contingency matter.
                    The new Nixon administration commissioned a study of oil imports, with emphasis
                    on supply security and US options if the supplies were reduced or if world
                    prices greatly increased. I think one of the driving forces for the study was
                    the notion that the US should encourage prudent use of its domestic production
                    so that in case of an emergency, we would have sufficient reserves available
                    under our own soil. This contingency planning was certainly useful to me as a
                    learning opportunity about the oil business.</p>
                <p>As we began to further develop the oil import policy, we became of course
                    involved in many inter-agency meetings. We met under the aegis of the NSC in
                    their new Executive Office building. Jim went to those meetings and sometimes
                    would take me along. Interior and its Bureau of Mines were key players in the
                    government; DoD was always involved because it had a very real interest in the
                    cost of energy, being the government's largest customer. When issues bore on
                    Asia or Latin America, I would keep the appropriate desk officers informed. But
                    our issues were relatively non-controversial particularly when compared to
                    Middle East ones. As I recall, I don't think the regional bureaus were that much
                    concerned by oil in any case. At the time I am discussing, Akins worked for
                    Jules Katz—the Deputy Assistant Secretary under Assistant Secretary Phil
                    Trezise—who was a very tough, practical man, who later in the 1990s would make
                    major contributions to US trade policies. Partly because of their ability and
                    partly because the regional bureaus really didn't care, I think Trezise and
                    Katz—and Akins in the fuels area—had a major voice in the Department and in the
                    US government in the development of trade and economic policy. This was before
                    the establishment of USTR and the transfer of the commercial function from the
                    Department of State to Commerce. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the Department had
                    considerable more clout on economic issues than it did in later periods, in
                    part, as I said, because of the brilliance of the men in EB and partly because
                    the responsibility for trade and economic policy had not yet been fragmented
                    throughout the government.</p>
                <p>I also again learned that politics and economics are hard to separate. The oil
                    issues were a mixture of both disciplines as they had been in Indonesia. The oil
                    issues moreover were a combination of domestic and international issues, so that
                    bureaucratically, responsibility had to be diffused. But Akins was recognized in
                    Washington as one of the bright lights and an expert in the oil business. In
                    fact, as I was later told, eventually Akins went to the NSC to work directly
                    with Kissinger on oil issues. He wrote a paper which could have become the US
                    oil policy position; unfortunately, I suspect, it was not adopted. Akins ran
                    into Ehrlichman and Haldeman, who apparently did not think very highly of his
                    basic policy paper. Again I was told that they were reflecting the unhappiness
                    of the CEOs of the major oil companies who saw Akins' prescriptions as a danger
                    to their profits. That was enough to kill Akins' paper.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>During my 18 months in “Fuels and Energy”, I managed to squeeze out one overseas
                    trip—Venezuela, Ecuador and Columbia. It was the first—and last—time that I saw
                    Latin America; so it was personally rewarding. The late 1960s was the beginning
                    of the Andean oil industry. Venezuela had been developing its resources for some
                    time, but Ecuador and Colombia were just beginning. We had considerable interest
                    in Venezuelan production, in its heavy oil and tars. Venezuela was a major
                    player in OPEC which made it even more important for us. We had good relations
                    with that country and had no major disputes in those days on oil issues. I did
                    not get involved very much in Mexican oil issues; they had not yet become the
                    focus of attention as they did later.</p>
                <p>Oil has always fascinated me. It is at a key political-economic junction. It is
                    an extraordinarily important and central commodity, which had and would even
                    further become a key factor in our policy determinations. What I learned about
                    oil in Jakarta and in Washington would prove to be useful to me in other
                    assignments, although I never returned to the issue as the sole focus of my
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>There was one personality in EB that should be mentioned and that was Frances
                    Wilson, the Executive Director. There are undoubtedly many stories about her,
                    but the one I remember the best came towards the end of my assignment in EB. By
                    1970, I think I was even more ready for a regular political assignment. I asked
                    Frances Wilson whether she could help me get an assignment to the East Asia
                    Bureau (EA). I put the request to her several times—each time with increasing
                    intensity. Finally, I got a letter from her telling me that I had been assigned
                    to the Office of Finance in EB. That really upset me: in the first place, I did
                    not, as I have said before believe that I was a professional economist—I did not
                    have the prerequisites, particularly a sense about statistics, that a job in the
                    Office of Finance required. I felt that I would have to struggle very hard just
                    to keep my head above water in the Office of Finance. Secondly, as I have said,
                    I had decided that the time had come for me to move to another functional
                    discipline in a geographic bureau.</p>
                <p>The letter reached me at about the time I was making inquiries in the East Asia
                    Bureau about positions that might be available there. No luck until one day Bob
                    Duemling, the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary, my Indonesian boss
                    Marshall Green, asked me whether I would be interested in working in the
                    Assistant Secretary's Office. I leaped at the opportunity; I couldn't believe my
                    good fortunate because it was just the job that I wanted. Even though I had
                    responded positively, I wasn't sure that anything would come of the inquiry. But
                    the next day, I got a call from Green, who remembered me from Jakarta where I
                    think he was pleased with my work. He told me that he would be pleased to have
                    me as his Special Assistant. After that conversation, I went to Akins and told
                    him about the offer and my wish to accept it. Jim said that he would support my
                    wishes. But as the next days passed, it became clear that EA wanted me right
                    away and did not want to wait until the end of my EB tour which still had six
                    months to go. Bob Duemling was leaving and the Bureau wanted his replacement
                    right away.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>When Akins found out about the timing of the immediate transfer, he hit the roof.
                    He said he could not get anyone to replace me. He was so furious he refused to
                    release me. I told him that the timing had come as a surprise to me as well, but
                    that the Special Assistant job was one I wanted very badly, and I hoped that the
                    six months' difference would not scotch the deal. But Akins went to Trezise and
                    complained. At the same time EA asked me whether I was still interested in light
                    of the anger that my transfer had created, and I assured the Regional Bureau
                    that I was still very much interested. In fact, as the storm was brewing, I had
                    already begun to look for employment outside the government. I had made up my
                    mind that I would not stay in EB or in any other economic position. So if the
                    transfer to EA had not come through, I was prepared to leave the Foreign
                    Service. If I was going to be in the Service, I wanted to be in the “front line”
                    and that was a regional bureau in Washington or as a political officer in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>Marshall Green through Bob Duemling in essence told me to sit tight. I didn't
                    hear anything for several days, when all of a sudden, I was told to report to
                    EA. I heard later that Green had called Trezise on my behalf; Trezise reportedly
                    said that he could not turn down Marshall Green in such a case. Akins was
                    besides himself when he heard; he took his revenge by writing a terrible
                    efficiency report on me. That was entirely unfair. I lost all respect for Akins,
                    even though after my complaint, he did improve the first draft somewhat. But one
                    would have to say that even in its final version, it was not a good OER. It was
                    obvious that the report in 1970 was far worse than the previous one, and led to
                    the conclusion that my work had deteriorated in the intervening period, which
                    was certainly not the case. It was that comparison that really aggravated me.
                    Had this happened years later, I would have taken the issue up through the
                    grievance procedure, but that alternative did not exist in 1971.</p>
                <p>There is no question that that ER kept me off the promotion list for at least a
                    couple of years. Fortunately, I had had some good reports between the poor Bonn
                    and EB ones; otherwise I would have been in much greater difficulties than I
                    was. Promotion Panels are not known for their fast reading ability. Rarely do
                    they go back six years in a file; so that I doubt that the ER that George McGhee
                    had written was given much attention after such a long intervening period. The
                    members just don't have the time to read all files from front to back when there
                    are so many files to be reviewed.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: Like most “Front Office” jobs, it is up to an individual what he or
                    she makes of it. There were of course certain requirements: the management of
                    the paper flow in the Assistant Secretary's office including determining which
                    documents had to be seen by the principal and which had to be seen by one or
                    more of the deputies; supervision of the documents that were to go from the
                    Assistant Secretary to the principals of the Department—i.e. made sure that they
                    conformed with the strict rules imposed by S/S; that the Assistant Secretary's
                    decision were implemented; etc. I had two aides and a secretary working for me,
                    primarily on the paper flow.</p>
                <p>After a learning period, like most active special assistants, I became involved
                    in some policy issues. I attended and wrote up a lot of meetings. I tried on a
                    couple of occasions to “correct” a couple of memoranda sent by one officer
                    director or another to Green; that was not welcomed and I stopped doing that. I
                    recall preparing the outline of a speech that Marshall was to give, placing some
                    of the major EA issues in the context of major economic initiatives like Bretton
                    Woods.</p>
                <p>When Dick Sneider became the deputy for North-east Asia, - principally Japan and
                    Korea, he used me to help him. By that time, I knew enough about EA that I was
                    able to contribute some ideas. Dick was the only Deputy who regularly asked for
                    my help on substantive matters; the other Deputies would ask for my help from
                    time to time, but not as consistently as Sneider did. I remember participating
                    in a major paper on Northeast Asian security that Dick was developing. As I
                    said, by the time this happened, I had already been in EA for two years and I
                    felt comfortable with most of the major issues facing the Bureau.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived, Win Brown was the senior Deputy, although he was already a
                    Career Ambassador. But Marshall had convinced him to take the job even though it
                    may have been below his grade level. Brown took the job because he admired Green
                    and the feeling was mutual. Jonathan Moore was one of the Deputies; he was a
                    political appointee—a young, hard charging Republican—who had spent some years
                    working for Elliot Richardson, when he was the Deputy Secretary. Bob Barnett was
                    the Deputy in charge of economic issues; he was followed by Frank Barger.
                    Sneider and Art Hummel became Deputies, later on. Sneider had returned to
                    Washington from Tokyo where he had been the DCM. He thought that he was going to
                    be the senior Deputy—Sneider was very ambitious. But Art Hummel came on board
                    first. Marshall liked Art very much and finally decided that Hummel would become
                    the senior Deputy. I remember Marshall asking me for my advice on this issue. I
                    don't think I gave him an altogether useful reply. I didn't think it was right
                    for me to choose between Hummel and Sneider. I liked them both. I did help Green
                    in trying to soothe Sneider's feelings, although that was not easy.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I remember the major, rather silly battle that occurred concerning the size of
                    the desks that the Deputies used. Hummel came to me because he wanted a desk
                    that was as large if not larger than Sneider's. Dick had been given the larger
                    office, which the senior Deputy usually occupied. I guess that was part of the
                    compromise; Hummel became the senior Deputy but got a smaller office. In any
                    case, the “desk war” broke out, but I can't remember how this “major policy
                    issue” was finally resolved.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of personnel work, which I enjoyed and I think I did quite well. In
                    fact, by the time I left EA in 1973, I was an important player in the personnel
                    assignment process. During this period, the regional bureaus picked the DCMs for
                    their embassies as well as political and economic counselors. The central
                    Personnel Office kept trying to become involved in the assignment process, but
                    it was never able to match our knowledge of the individual officers who were
                    candidates for these key positions. So we in EA had the final word and because
                    Marshall was very busy much of that burden fell to me. I sat in on the EA senior
                    assignment meetings. Since I had been in EA for a couple of years, I knew our
                    personnel well and was therefore able to make a considerable contribution to the
                    selections. Marshall looked to me for background and advice on these assignments
                    and I think I helped him on personnel matters.</p>
                <p>EA had a lot of media attention because we were still in the Vietnam period. I
                    saw the press and TV representatives frequently, briefing them on recent
                    developments. I viewed this media liaison as enjoyable. I did get into trouble
                    one time—the day in 1972 after the Yushin Constitution was introduced in Korea.
                    Tad Szulc of “The New York Times” took me to lunch. He asked me thirteen
                    times—literally—what the leadership of the Department thought about the new
                    Constitution. Yushin was not what anyone would consider a “democratic”
                    Constitution; if anything it was a legal rationale for the Park Chung Hee
                    authoritarian regime. Twelve times I told Szulc that I would not answer that
                    question because it was obviously a sensitive issue. On the thirteenth time, I
                    said: “God damn it, Tad, you know perfectly well how they felt!” That remark
                    turned into a front-page headline about how the State Department leadership
                    viewed the new Korean Constitution with great unhappiness. The story itself said
                    nothing about how the Department leadership felt; it was only in the morning
                    headline. Within fifteen minutes of the time I arrived at work that morning, I
                    was summoned by Green. Don Ranard, the Korean Country Director, was in the room.
                    Marshall asked me whether I had talked to Szulc. I admitted that I had, but that
                    the story was not based on anything I had actually said. Marshall said, “Darn”
                    which is about as strong a word as he ever used; he had hoped, he said, to be
                    able to tell Alexis Johnson, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, that the
                    “leak” had not come from his office. Don, who was a strong human rights
                    supporter even then, piped up and said, “Well, God dammit, Marshall, it is
                    true!” There was no disagreement on that remark.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>There was only one other occasion when I felt badly about a story. I think it
                    appeared in the “Washington Star”. It was about a UN vote on the China issue,
                    where I predicted the US vote to George Sherman. Nobody traced it to me, but I
                    faulted myself. But that was the extent of trouble with the media. All my other
                    briefings and conversations were well received and accurately reported.</p>
                <p>My willingness to speak to the media first started in Jakarta. I didn't think
                    then it was uncommon; several of my Embassy colleagues were talking with the
                    press—it was an interesting time in Jakarta and we could be helpful to the press
                    in understanding what was going on. The events after the coup were mostly
                    positive, certainly on the economic side, and it was important we believed for
                    the press to have an appreciation of the major changes taking place. I also
                    liked the press people. They were useful in that periodically they would pass
                    information on that was useful to me and the Embassy. I would spend a few
                    evenings at the bar of the Indonesia Hotel talking to people like Carston
                    Praeger, later foreign editor of “Time”. Periodically, I would talk to the Kalb
                    brothers, John Hughes—a Pulitzer Prize winner—, Bob Keatley—who is still a
                    friend—, and others who would come in and out of Jakarta to write stories about
                    the “new” Indonesia. I liked them and I learned a lot from them. Fred Emery of
                    the London Times became a special friend in later years.</p>
                <p>I remember reading Harold Nicholson's book on diplomacy; he said that as a junior
                    officer he had learned a lot more from the press than it had from him. So I have
                    always kept an open door to the press. While in EA, I used to see Hendrick Smith
                    and Terence Smith of “The New York Times”, Bill Mader of “TIME”, “NEWSWEEK”
                    reporters, Bob Keatley—then with the “Wall Street Journal”, etc. I never told
                    the press anything that was not true—at least as far as I knew. I always spoke
                    on “background”—never for the record. I was never quoted. My information and
                    discussion was not front page material; I tried to paint the background and
                    framework against which events and decisions were taking place; in other words,
                    was trying to give the media information and insights which would permit it to
                    report a more informed story. This was particularly true on Vietnam stories,
                    where the Washington based reporters were somewhat handicapped by being so far
                    removed from the action. The fact I was also far removed didn't seem to bother
                    me. At my level I was not privy to a lot of the more high level considerations
                    that were taking place; even Marshall was not privy to discussions taking place
                    on Vietnam in Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Bill Sullivan was the EA Deputy on Vietnam. Bill, although officially a member of
                    Marshall's staff, played a lone hand. He had been our Ambassador in Laos having
                    already reached ambassadorial level at an early age, after an assignment as
                    Special Assistant to Averell Harriman. He had a very powerful personality—very
                    tough. Secondly, he had a direct line to Kissinger—a much stronger tie than I
                    had first realized. And then of course he had a direct line to the Vietnam,
                    Cambodia, and Laos desks. But he was not really part of the EA team; for
                    example, he never attended Green's staff meetings. For all practical purposes,
                    he seemed just to be attached to EA Bureau, even though he was a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. He would tell Marshall what he wanted Marshall to know;
                    much he did not share. For example, he never told Marshall about his most
                    critical actions while in EA—the thirteen trips he took secretly to Paris with
                    Kissinger for the Vietnam negotiations. My view was that Sullivan did not treat
                    Marshall as an Assistant Secretary should have been by one of his Deputies; I
                    think that was unconscionable and unforgivable. He should have found a way,
                    although I have no doubt that Sullivan was under orders from Kissinger to keep
                    certain things from Marshall or anyone else. This was not the only example of
                    Kissinger's style of operation, but others in many instances found ways around
                    his dictates.</p>
                <p>Later on, John Kelly, our Ambassador in Lebanon, took orders from the NSC without
                    informing the then Secretary of State, George Shultz. When Shultz found out
                    about that, Kelly was immediately recalled to Washington and came very close to
                    being fired. I certainly have some sympathy for Kelly; it is a very difficult
                    predicament, but my view is that an ambassador or any Foreign Service Officer
                    belongs to a chain of command and that one should accept orders only from that
                    chain. If you are under direct orders from the President, then of course you
                    follow those, but orders from the NSC Advisor or his staff should come to an
                    officer through the established chain or at least be shared with one's
                    superiors. In the Sullivan case, I found it unacceptable that he would not share
                    his directives from the NSC Advisor or knowledge with his boss, Assistant
                    Secretary Green. Since Marshall didn't know, I certainly was not aware of what
                    Sullivan was doing until later. The Vietnam negotiations were theoretically
                    under Green's purview; it was understood internally that Sullivan was the lead
                    man within the Department.</p>
                <p>But this situation must also be seen within the larger context; we were then in a
                    period when President Nixon and Kissinger had in effect sidelined the
                    Department. They were in total control of the conduct of the major foreign
                    policy issues, and had very little opposition from the Department because
                    Secretary Rogers was a patsy, who did not have the knowledge or relationship
                    with Nixon adequate to off-set Kissinger's inside track. So Kissinger had an
                    open field in which to operate.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>This situation was exacerbated by Elliot Richardson's departure. As long as
                    Richardson was the Deputy Secretary, the Department was a major player in many
                    issues; when he left, the Department's role became even less important.
                    Kissinger's modus operandi was to keep the Department busy on many non-important
                    matters, particularly on the subject matters which he wanted to control. His
                    continual demands to the Department for papers and studies kept us busy
                    producing reams of inconsequential material. I recall Mark Pratt did a 400 page
                    National Security Study Memo (NSSM) on Laos. As Marshall once said about the
                    NSSM: “We'll never miss 'em.”</p>
                <p>Another Kissinger tactic: while Marshall and Jonathan Moore and others carefully
                    examined an issue, Kissinger would appear at some NSC meeting and announce the
                    President's position before anyone had had a full opportunity to voice their
                    views. Finally, Kissinger—I am sure with Nixon's blessings—cut experts like
                    Marshall Green out of the process to which they could have been valuable
                    contributors, since they often knew more about the subject matter than either
                    Nixon or Kissinger would ever know. Marshall and other Department experts were
                    left out of the game; that was particularly true on Southeast Asia and
                    China.</p>
                <p>Marshall had no idea that Kissinger was in China preparing for a Presidential
                    trip. I was in his office when Marshall received a call from Secretary Rogers
                    telling him about the Kissinger trip and the planned Presidential trip.
                    Marshall's first reaction was to praise the initiative. He said that he had
                    hoped for many years that such a rapprochement would come about and had begun
                    planning for it in 1960 when Consul General in Hong Kong. But then Marshall
                    asked the Secretary whether the Japanese had been informed. Rogers did not
                    understand the question. Marshall went on to ask again whether the Japanese had
                    been informed. Rogers had to be told of the importance of keeping the Japanese
                    informed; he had to be told that every Japanese Prime Minister had dreaded the
                    day when he would find out from a public source that the American President was
                    on his way to Beijing. Later we saw a picture of Sato sitting in front of a TV
                    set, looking very glum, listening to the news of the Presidential visit which he
                    found out about at the same time as the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>Much later John Holdridge, who was the NSC staffer for the Far East for Kissinger
                    told me that the Japanese angle had been discussed in the White House. This may
                    have been true, but the decision not to give the Japanese advance notice had
                    been wrong and created unnecessary tensions between us and the Japanese
                    subsequently—the Nixon “Shokku”. Holdridge's view was that if the Japanese had
                    been informed, it would have been in the public press the next day. That was not
                    the conclusion that the State Department experts would have reached. They felt
                    that a one-on-one session with the Prime Minister would have insured the
                    confidentiality of the information and would have avoided embarrassing Sato.
                    There is no question that the opening to China was a major foreign policy coup,
                    but the way it was done was a devastating blow to Marshall. As I said, Marshall
                    had hoped for such an event for many years, but when it actually happened he was
                    cut out.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>One final piece of irony on China. Marshall set up two sessions with academics on
                    China in 1971 and 1972 to discuss what we should do. They were exceptional
                    sessions and came up with the need for opening to China. But of course they were
                    irrelevant.</p>
                <p>Let me return to the press for a moment. In all of my conversations, in addition
                    to sensitive material, I avoided references to particular personalities and who
                    did what to whom; that was not my style. I tried to provide the larger picture.
                    I never had any doubt that the media had an important role to play in foreign
                    policy. I felt then, and I do still today, that if you treat the media
                    positively and with trust and were as open as you could possibly be, it would be
                    reciprocated. It is true that most of the people I dealt with were either at the
                    time or became leaders in their profession. With the one exception that I have
                    described, they reported my comments accurately. Of course, I was not their only
                    source, so that they were always able to double check what I might have said. I
                    never tried to deny my press contacts; Marshall certainly knew what I was doing
                    and I suspect that other parts of the Department did as well. But I was never
                    told to cease and desist, in part because I did not try to use the media for my
                    own purposes; I was providing background information, as I have said, to enable
                    the media to do a better job of informing its public.</p>
                <p>One final word: a lot of what I learned about the press and how it operated came
                    from John Hightower, the AP's Pulitzer Prize winning diplomatic correspondent.
                    He was a marvelous human being and a great reporter...and luckily for me a good
                    friend. I got to know him through Carter who was a friend of Martha Hightower,
                    who taught our boys reading.</p>
                <p>I must make it clear that Marshall never complained about being cut out of some
                    of the key Far East policy decisions. But I think he was shattered by the way he
                    had been treated. This was particularly true because while in Indonesia, he had
                    had a long, long conversation—into the early hours of the morning—with Nixon,
                    who was then a private citizen. I think it was clear that Nixon had accepted
                    Marshall's approach to Far East issues, particularly on the theme of helping the
                    Asians to help themselves. The converse of that view was that the US should not
                    be so deeply involved in the affairs of foreign countries. China was also
                    brought up during this long dialogue, with Marshall urging an opening to this
                    huge country. A couple of years later, Green was the originator of the “Guam
                    doctrine” (which later evolved into the “Nixon doctrine”)— a speech in which
                    Nixon said that we were going to help the Asians help themselves. That original
                    Green concept eventually turned into the US exit strategy from Vietnam because
                    the “Nixon doctrine” called for the Vietnamese to do their own fighting. That is
                    not necessarily what Marshall had in mind when he drafted the Guam speech, but
                    that was the seed from which our new Vietnam policy grew.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So the subsequent snubbing of Green by Nixon and Kissinger must have hurt
                    Marshall even more than it would have under normal circumstances; after all, he
                    had been the instigator of some of the most important initiatives that Nixon
                    took in the Far East, except that when the time came to put these new policies
                    into effect, Green was left out of the process. He focused on issues like Laos
                    and Cambodia, when they became a problem. But Marshall never expressed any anger
                    or anguish; he was obviously hurt and upset by the way he was being treated, but
                    he never pouted; he went on doing the best job he knew how. Many years later he
                    said to me while we were talking about Phil Habib, whom he always saw as
                    somewhat of a rival, “Well, in retrospect, I probably should have done it the
                    way Phil did.” I was not sure then nor today what exactly Marshall had in mind,
                    but it was obvious that some underlying bitterness about his career had lasted.
                    In any case, Marshall could never have done the things that Phil did; they were
                    entirely different personalities with different outlooks.</p>
                <p>In addition to the areas I have mentioned—China, Southeast Asia—there was always
                    interest on the Seventh Floor and in the White House on Japan. But this was a
                    period of very little tension and the relationships were positive, except for
                    the three “Nixon Shokkus”. But I was not very deeply involved in Northeast Asia
                    issues; I had not served there and didn't have any particular expertise. I used
                    to repeat the “party line” that Japan was the most important country in Asia and
                    that it was the “linchpin” of our position in the Far East—a phrase that seems
                    to have been immortalized. Sneider handled Japan matters and worried about the
                    “Shokkus”, the China trip, soybeans, etc., all subjects that unsettled the
                    Japanese. But by and large I believe we managed our relations with the Japan
                    well in this period and never had any major uproars.</p>
                <p>I never felt that the Assistant Secretary was stretched “too thin”; i.e. that
                    issues were neglected. We had strong Deputies who made decisions and then
                    Kissinger personally handled the most vexing problems—China and Indochina. In
                    fact, there was a debate on whether EA's jurisdiction should not be extended to
                    cover South Asia. We thought South Asia issues could be handled by either EA or
                    NEA, although we had a preference for jurisdiction over South Asia matters being
                    transferred to EA. It was clear then, as it is today, that the NEA Assistant
                    Secretary had adequate time to devote to South Asia issues, but I am not sure
                    that today's solution—setting up a separate bureau—is a wholly satisfactory
                    answer either.</p>
                <p>One last thing I did for Marshall; I set up weekly think sessions on various EA
                    subjects. Originally designed to bring Secretary Rogers up to speed on Vietnam,
                    Rogers never came. So the meetings became bull sessions on all aspects of US
                    East Asia policy. Because the people were excellent (Art Hartman, Mort
                    Abramowitz) the sessions were stimulating.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The assignment as special assistant was a very useful training ground. After
                    three years—which was an unusually long assignment for someone in my position—I
                    had developed a good grasp of how the Department worked. I also got to know
                    virtually everyone in EA. Finally, I learned something about management style
                    from Dick Sneider, who was a good manager. I once told him that; he answered
                    that he had not started out that way and that he had to work hard to become a
                    good manager. Dick was very exacting; he was well organized. Dick also stood out
                    in contrast with Marshall, who was intellectually brilliantly organized, but was
                    not a hands-on manager. He certainly expected issues to be handled expeditiously
                    and correctly, but he himself devoted greatest attention to the intellectual
                    analysis of a problem. He was more of an ideas leader; he left the
                    responsibility for the day-to-day activities and movement to his deputies like
                    Sneider and Hummel.</p>
                <p>In addition, EA was blessed with good country directors. My favorites were Dick
                    Ericson, Tom Shoesmith and Ed Masters, all of whom became ambassadors. Al
                    Bergson and John Dexter were there and were very good. Ed Masters was
                    exceptionally well organized; in fact I think he was the best organized officer
                    I ever encountered. I think, in retrospect, we would have to conclude that EA in
                    this period ran well; we all worked hard in seeing that it did so. We thought we
                    were the equal of EUR, which had historically had the reputation of being the
                    best staffed bureau in the Department. We were well staffed, led by an
                    intellectual leader, supported by some hard charging and exacting deputies and
                    excellent office directors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1973, you were assigned to Seoul, Korea as the
                        Politico-Military officer. Is that an assignment that you had
                        requested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: It was indeed. It was a job that I wanted. I had asked for it
                    specifically and Marshall fully supported my desire. I had become interested in
                    Korea and in addition it clearly removed me from the economic field. The
                    Politico-Military job was actually the Number Two job in the Political Section.
                    Phil Habib was the Ambassador and Dan O'Donahue was the Political Counselor. I
                    had not known Phil but Dan and I had entered the Foreign Service in the same
                    class and therefore had known each other for many years. My first DCM was Frank
                    Underhill, with whom I was slightly acquainted because he had been the Indonesia
                    Country Director in Washington while I was serving in Jakarta. Frank was
                    succeeded by Dick Ericson, whom I knew well from our days together in EA. So I
                    knew the senior players well except for the Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I had never been to Seoul before. When we arrived at our new post, we found that
                    we were going to have to live in a compound. I have already mentioned my
                    discomfort with those kind of living arrangements; the opportunity to live among
                    locals was one of the reasons why I was happy to go to Jakarta. In fact, once we
                    had adjusted, we found that in Seoul, living in an American compound was not a
                    great hardship or disadvantage; we were able to become completely immersed in
                    the Korean society. Our home was in Compound Two, which was a short walk to the
                    Embassy. The housing area was surrounded by walls, but outside of that we were
                    in the midst of Seoul residential area. I did not find that in Seoul, living in
                    a compound interfered in the slightest with establishing personal contacts with
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>In Seoul it was relatively easy to be in touch with the Korean community because
                    there were a large number of Koreans, mostly American educated and all English
                    speakers, who welcomed American Embassy personnel. Quite a few of them were in
                    influential positions and were helpful professionally as well as personally.
                    Dixie Walker, our Ambassador in the 1980s, when I was DCM, used to say that
                    there were more graduate degree holders from American universities and colleges
                    working in high corporate and government jobs in Korea than in any other country
                    in the world, including the US.</p>
                <p>I don't believe that Seoul was unique in that respect; I think every overseas
                    American government establishment has a group of pro-American local people who
                    want to stay in touch with Americans. I am not saying this in any negative
                    sense, although at times I was a little cynical about some and questioned
                    whether their motives were entirely friendly. Some were extraordinarily nice and
                    helpful; they also helped us to meet other members of the Korean society. It is
                    true, I believe, that perhaps the Embassy in Seoul had more of these local
                    contacts than most other posts. But there were good reasons. In the first place,
                    the US was an unparalleled overwhelming influence on Korean foreign relations.
                    Secondly, we had troops in Korea to protect that country from an invasion from
                    the North. Thirdly, we were then and are today Korea's major trading partner; we
                    bought in the 1970s something like one-ninth of their economy. Finally, we were
                    the number one attraction for Korean emigrants, in addition to being the main
                    attraction for academic studies.</p>
                <p>So Korea and the US had many, many ties which I think accounted for the large
                    number of Koreans who wished to be associated with the Embassy. On the other
                    side, Americans found Koreans, despite their well earned reputation for
                    negotiating toughness and stubbornness, fun to be with. They were open,
                    mercurial in many ways, and most were generous people. I think Americans
                    probably felt more comfortable with them than other Asians—although
                    generalizations like that need to be taken with caution. We got along personally
                    with Koreans well; they were generous in introducing us to their culture, their
                    countryside and their history. We played a lot of golf with Koreans and drank a
                    lot of Scotch with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Seoul had some aspects of a city “under siege”. We had for example, monthly air
                    raid practices, when all the citizens would have to evacuate the streets and run
                    to the nearest shelters. If you traveled north outside of Seoul, you would run
                    into a maze of tank traps, defensive obstacles and blowable bridges which would
                    be used in an invasion to block roads. Everywhere one went in Korea, you noticed
                    military encampments—both American and Korean. The landscape itself was a
                    constant reminder of the threat from the North. I think we all noticed this
                    atmosphere, although, since my job focused on this aspect of Korean life, I may
                    perhaps been more aware of it than others. But I don't think that I personally
                    felt any immediate threat. A study of the balance of forces on the Peninsula,
                    when added to the fire and manpower that we could bring to bear from outside
                    Korea, would lead one to the conclusion that the North had to be either very
                    stupid or very desperate to start any hostilities. Of course, none of us knew
                    enough about the North to be entirely confident that they would not make some
                    dumb mistake. We concluded they were aggressive, but not crazy.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I shared the view of most that the North was un-predictable. I
                    thought that it was perfectly capable at any time of undertaking small unit
                    actions, commando invasion efforts, etc. The North was also a very tough
                    negotiator at Panmunjom. So a threat of a North Korean eruption was always
                    present. It was clearly the North's policy that if any of its nationals got into
                    a tough situation—whether at sea in a small boat challenged by a South Korean
                    vessel or in the DMZ when a North Korean may have strayed beyond the demarcation
                    line—they would shoot first and ask questions later. So that in that sense they
                    were unpredictable and at times provocative.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, when a fire fight would erupt—and I observed the evolution of
                    many—I noticed that control of events would be quickly taken over by higher
                    echelons, both in the North and in the South. That tended to localize any
                    incidents. Phil Habib used to say that one would never know what was actually
                    going on in the DMZ and I think that was correct because we could not cover the
                    zone all the way across the Peninsula. But where we did have observation points,
                    you could readily notice that command and control of a bad situation would be
                    taken over by higher echelon headquarters very rapidly. In the North, that
                    usually meant that Pyongyang would take command; it was quite clear that it
                    would not permit these incidents to get out of hand. My guess was that the
                    policy was that under no circumstances would the North wish to show any
                    weakness; as I said, they would shoot first and ask questions later. But once
                    the initial exchange had taken place, Pyongyang would exercise restraint and not
                    further aggravate a situation by aggressively moving forces towards the South.
                    So I never thought that a major invasion from the North was a very realistic
                    possibility. Although that may have been due more to my naivete than knowledge,
                    that is how things have turned out.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>My view that we were far from a second Korean war was also based on the fact that
                    there hadn't been a major outbreak of hostilities on the Peninsula since 1950.
                    There had been a perceptible rise in tensions in the DMZ in 1968-69 with
                    hundreds of deaths—I learned a lot about that from Dick Ericson who was serving
                    in Seoul at the time. Those tensions, which were accentuated by fire fights, had
                    receded in 1969. There were incidents after that, but they were relatively minor
                    compared to the deaths that occurred in the 1968-69 period, when we had the
                    Pueblo incident and the Blue House raid. The assassination of Madame Park in
                    1973 was a critical moment but in general I believe that by 1973, relationships
                    between the North and the South, although tense, had calmed down from the
                    previous decade; my view was that the North was being less aggressive.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that both the South Koreans and we did not continually harp on
                    the possibility of a North invasion or other aggressive actions. We did. This
                    was due in part to the need for us to be constantly alert and prepared because
                    any sign of weakness or relaxation on the part of the South or the US might well
                    have led the North to make a serious policy miscalculation. (Masters of real
                    politik, Koreans are quick to exploit weakness.) Under such circumstances, I
                    think the risks of an attack would have risen considerably. That perception led
                    me and most other American officials in Korea to the conclusion that the
                    withdrawal of American forces would be a major mistake. I felt that the
                    psychological environment on the Peninsula required an American presence and a
                    well prepared and alert military force south of the DMZ that could be a
                    deterrent to the North's ambitions. It was important not only that the US and
                    South Korean forces be capable and alert, but that we publicly state repeatedly
                    that we were concerned about Pyongyang's intentions, both to maintain pressure
                    on the North and to insure that we ourselves did not let down our guard, which
                    would have been the worst prescription for potential disaster. I think the
                    validity of this thesis grew in my mind the longer I studied the situation in
                    Korea; I am not sure that I had given it much thought before my assignment. But
                    as I learned more about the military situation on the Peninsula, the more I
                    became convinced that a well prepared and ready deterrent force was absolutely
                    essential.</p>
                <p>So in 1976, when President Carter began to talk about troop withdrawal, I thought
                    his position was ill-advised; psychologically, it was ill timed and raised risks
                    where they were not necessary. In fact, the withdrawal of American troops might
                    well have invited a North attack; such an event, as Habib used to say, would
                    have lost us all that we had tried to achieve in the South.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>An American troop presence, in my view, was essential to maintaining peace on the
                    Korean Peninsula. I also thought that if we were to maintain troops in Asia,
                    they should be near the potential battle field as an indication of our resolve;
                    that was important not only for the Koreans, but also for the Japanese who also
                    needed clear evidence of US resolve to maintain stability on Northeast Asia.
                    Korea provided us some of the cheapest and best training grounds in the world;
                    furthermore, if the division was to be removed from South Korea it would have
                    had to be demobilized because we didn't have the resources to accommodate it in
                    the continental US. I don't think there was too much concern about Carter's
                    comments during the campaign; there was probably some nervousness in both the
                    Korean and American community, but a Carter electoral victory was hardly a sure
                    thing in 1976.</p>
                <p>But once he became President in 1977 and announced his plan to follow through on
                    his campaign commitment to withdraw American ground troops from South Korea,
                    then there was a major uproar. The withdrawal announcement was made at a noon
                    White House press briefing. It was made one hour before he was to see the Korean
                    Ambassador, Park Tung Jin, who had no advanced warning. I was as infuriated by
                    that tactic, which showed disrespect and was in very bad taste, as I was by the
                    policy decision itself. I think there was a general consensus in the Embassy
                    that it was a very unwise policy decision as well as an embarrassment on how it
                    was announced.</p>
                <p>I must say that I was not totally convinced that the withdrawal policy was
                    totally wrong because of my view of the threat; i.e. not as great as it had
                    been. I thought that a well thought-out plan, implemented over a period of years
                    and reversible at any time if a threat loomed, might be acceptable. That became
                    Ambassador Sneider's view; whether that was his real view or a tactical
                    compromise with the new President, was not clear. I am inclined to believe that
                    Dick thought that the policy was essentially wrong, but he may well have reached
                    the conclusion that to fight it straight on was not likely to be successful and
                    therefore he looked for some kind of compromise. So he sent to Washington a
                    series of messages which said if the withdrawal goal was immutable, then he had
                    some suggestions on how it might be reached with minimal damage to our position
                    in South Korea and Northeast Asia as a whole. This became an eight or nine part
                    series which involved many of the Embassy's senior officers. The bottom line was
                    that Dick recommended a very slow withdrawal schedule, stretched out over years,
                    so that a sense of catastrophe would not be generated in Northeast Asia. He also
                    recommended that an expanded Air Force contingent be left in Korea and that as
                    our troops withdrew, we increase our investment in the self-sufficiency of the
                    South Korean armed forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In fact, that eight part series covered all aspects of our current and future
                    relationships with South Korea; it covered political, economic and
                    infrastructure issues. It was one of Dick's final reports because he was soon
                    transferred to another position. It was a good series of messages, which
                    unfortunately fell on deaf ears. I later found out from the Korean director, Ed
                    Hurwitz, who had been the Political Counselor in Seoul for one year until 1976,
                    that he had sent the messages to the EA front office with covering memoranda
                    supporting the Embassy's views and recommendations, but that Dick Holbrooke, the
                    new Assistant Secretary, had ignored them.</p>
                <p>As I said, I was assigned to the job of Politico-Military officer and was also
                    the deputy head of the Political Section. My main responsibility was to follow
                    the politico-military scene in Korea. Essentially it was a matter of keeping up
                    to date on events in Yongsan, the US military command post and insuring that
                    political aspects of military questions were considered. I spent a great deal of
                    my time in a liaison capacity with the US military. I had some contact with the
                    Korean military, but that was limited primarily because our own military had
                    such extensive contacts with their Korean counterparts that there really wasn't
                    any need for another channel of communications. So most of my duties revolved
                    around working with our own military on a broad range of issues, such as civic
                    relations between the US military and the Korean communities—e.g. status of
                    forces. I was the Executive Secretary of the Joint Committee on the Status of
                    Forces.</p>
                <p>Korea is one of those places where there is a special problem for US
                    representation. It is vitally important that the Ambassador and the military
                    CINC work together because there have been occasions when the Korean leadership
                    has tried to play one off against the other. The role of the US Ambassador on
                    military issues was first established by Ambassador Muccio and mirrors in some
                    respect the relationship of the President to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
                    An American military which might have proceeded without adequate consultation
                    with the civilian side of the US representation could have gotten us in
                    considerable difficulties. There were political realities, both in Korea and
                    internationally, that made it essential for an American Ambassador to be
                    pre-eminent in Korea. The range of issues went from matters of war potential—the
                    Pueblo incident, the murder of two officers in the DMZ, etc—to the more mundane
                    issues like laying a pipeline through a Korean civilian area or a crime against
                    a Korean by an American GI. Also there were questions of US military
                    strategy—where our troops should be located—that required a political input.
                    Then there were always political questions about the Armistice Agreement and its
                    interpretation.</p>
                <p>There were also many questions about sales of US military equipment, and the
                    JUSMAG came under the Embassy. As in all cases, we had restrictions on the types
                    of armaments that we would sell. These were in major part foreign policy
                    questions, not only in Korea, but in a global context. Should we give the ROKs
                    missiles for example.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>For all these reasons, it was vital that the US Ambassador be given a voice in
                    many military matters and he take strong positions whenever necessary. But an
                    effective US Ambassador had to recognize that he had to deal with a four-star
                    general who was not going to be a patsy for any civilian that came along. The
                    best US position in Korea came when the Ambassador and the CINC worked
                    hand-in-glove, on a voluntary and continual basis. The ideal was not always
                    reached, but we all knew what the right model should be.</p>
                <p>The role of the American four star general was a tricky one. He was the Commander
                    of UN Forces which included Korean Forces—reporting to the UN through the
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs—, the Commander of US Forces—reporting to Commander
                    in Chief, Pacific Forces (CINCPAC)—, and Commander of the 8th Army—so that all
                    US forces could serve under an American general. All of this meant that the US
                    was represented in Seoul by the American Ambassador—the personal representative
                    of the President of the US—, and a four star US Army General, who served both in
                    a US and a UN capacity. On paper, it looked like an organizational nightmare.
                    The effectiveness of US representation is Seoul therefore had to depended
                    heavily on the cooperation of the two principals.</p>
                <p>A couple of months after I arrived, General Dick Stilwell became the Commander in
                    Chief, UN and US forces. Phil Habib had been our Ambassador for a couple of
                    years. As everybody knew, he was an extraordinary powerful man—almost
                    overwhelming. He was very adept at maintaining civilian control over military
                    affairs, which I think was quite appropriate in the Korean context. That Habib
                    style did not encounter much resistance in Yongsan. He was an extraordinary man.
                    Also a fine human being. Habib and Stilwell worked together reasonably well as
                    far as I could tell, although I was just learning my job towards the end of
                    Habib's tour. There were no explosions, although both were powerful men and I
                    suspect that some tension may well have existed.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Dick Sneider followed Habib in 1974, after the attempted assassination of Park
                    Chung Hee and the murder of his wife. Sneider had spent a lot of time in Japan
                    and therefore knew the area well. But unlike Habib, he had never served in Korea
                    before. The Sneider-Stilwell relationship deteriorated rapidly. I don't remember
                    exactly when the problems between the two started, but tensions were high almost
                    from the day Sneider arrived. I believe that much of the difficulties could be
                    attributed to Stilwell's desire to be independent and in charge. He was, of
                    course, a soldier and would follow orders, but it appeared to the Embassy and to
                    Sneider particularly that he would often try to act behind Dick's back, both
                    with Washington and the ROK. At times he would deal directly with the Koreans on
                    matters that went beyond strictly military considerations. Sometimes, he would
                    communicate with Washington, generating differences between the Pentagon and the
                    Department of State. I don't think it would be fair to blame the situation in
                    Seoul on Stilwell entirely. Undoubtedly, Sneider contributed to the high
                    tensions. Dick had a strong personality; he tended to be very aggressive and
                    assertive. If he felt that he was being subverted and that his role as
                    Ambassador was being minimized, he reacted strongly. So the combination of these
                    two strong personalities did not augur for a smooth relationship—and it wasn't.
                    Personal animosity developed; almost everything one did irked the other, down to
                    minutiae such as methods of communications.</p>
                <p>After a while, the situation between the principals became so tense that the main
                    responsibility for liaison and communications between the Embassy and the US
                    military fell on the DCMs—Ericson and later Tom Stern—and secondarily on me and
                    my successors. Dick Ericson's father had been a Colonel in the Army and
                    therefore he had some empathy for the military. He also was much more relaxed,
                    particularly when contrasted with Sneider. As politico-military officer, I had
                    daily contacts with the US military. The Political Counselors had some, but to a
                    more limited extent. I think all of us below the level of the principals were
                    very conscious of the friction at the top and tried our best to keep
                    relationships close and effective. Ericson did yeoman service in plugging the
                    gap. We at lower levels used to discuss the relationships of our principals
                    quite openly; both Embassy and Command officers recognized the problem and
                    worked very hard to overcome it.</p>
                <p>I should make one more comment that is personally important. I think it was
                    because of the situation in Seoul that I became thoroughly acquainted with the
                    US military, both professionally and socially. I developed a great respect for
                    them. As I suspect was true for many Foreign Service officers, before I came to
                    know military officers, I viewed them as conservative and tradition bound. But
                    my experiences in Seoul proved me wrong. I found those that I worked with to be
                    flexible, imaginative and intelligent. They obviously had their own
                    institutional biases and methods, but I never had any major problems in reaching
                    some mutually satisfactory accommodations.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I found that as in every organization, the US military had its own personality
                    problems. The most memorable of those was Lieutenant General Hollingsworth, then
                    in command of I Corps, and the second ranking American military officer in
                    Korea. He had his own problem with Stilwell. Hollingsworth had a rivalry with
                    Stilwell; they both were vying for credit for having developed the concept of
                    the “forward defense” strategy for defending South Korea. This was a radical
                    departure from established concepts which relied primarily on defense in depth
                    to thwart a North Korean invasion. It called for American and Korean forces to
                    fall back as the North advanced forcing the North to extend its supply lines.
                    The new doctrine called for stopping the North Koreans before they got to Seoul.
                    Hollingsworth would take groups of US visitors to the front lines in his
                    helicopter(s) and stand on one of the mountain tops of the ridge that divided
                    North and South. He would point down at the Chorwon Valley and in his inimitable
                    style, which always enthralled his audience, shout in his gruff voice,
                    :”Gentlemen, do you see that large valley down there? That is the Chorwon! That
                    is where we are going to slaughter the bastards!” The notion was to apply
                    overwhelming fire power on invaders who in fact had only a narrow route into the
                    South. He always called the Chorwon the “killing zone.” Holly was always a
                    proponent of the use of massive fire power; he was famous for his tactics from
                    Vietnam days, where he claimed he had dropped more ordinance during the Battle
                    of Anloc than at any time since we had bombed Dresden and Berlin.</p>
                <p>Our earlier military strategy was politically difficult to defend to the Koreans
                    because it had assumed that the North would occupy Seoul. The new doctrine was
                    much more politically palpable because it assumed that North Korean troops would
                    never reach Seoul. The Koreans loved Holly.</p>
                <p>When necessary, I would go to I Corps for liaison purposes. I once took the SOFA
                    Committee, of which I was the Executive Director, there. Most of the SOFA
                    members were Koreans, both military and civilians. Holly, as I suggest, was a
                    colorful character. We sat in his briefing room waiting in silence. All of a
                    sudden the door burst open. Holly strode across the floor to the briefing podium
                    which had on it a big I Corps symbol. Holly grabbed the cover, and flung it
                    across the room with a great clatter, shouting: “Welcome, gentlemen, to the
                    eastern front and the frontier of freedom”. The Koreans were thunderstruck; it
                    was a masterpiece of theater.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I was in Seoul when Major General John Singlaub sounded off.
                    He was the CINC's Chief of Staff and my principal contact—this was in 1977 after
                    I had become Political Counselor. The DCM's—Ericson and then Stern—held weekly
                    lunches with the Deputy Commander. Above them, Sneider had a close relationship
                    with Stilwell's successor, General Jack Vessey. But much of the day to day
                    liaison was supposed to fall to me and Jack Singlaub; we were supposed to meet
                    weekly, but I don't think we did so with any regularity. In any case, we met
                    frequently. I found him to be charming and fascinating. He knew a lot about the
                    French underground with which he had operated behind German lines in France
                    during WW II. Personally I thought we got along quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>On substantive issues, I found Singlaub pretty rigid, however, and quite
                    uncompromising, but knowing that both the Ambassador and the DCM had good
                    contacts with the military, I did not press him too far. If I ever discussed the
                    troop withdrawal issue, I am sure we both agreed that it was not a wise policy.
                    I was not totally surprised by the content of Jack's remarks to the press
                    criticizing President Carter's decision on the troop withdrawal, although I must
                    say I was taken aback by his public challenge to the President. Like most
                    Foreign Service and military officers, I had been trained to carry our
                    Presidential orders once they had ben issued. Jack forgot that fundamental role
                    of a military officer. Since his first comment was made on an airplane as he was
                    returning to the US, I never had the opportunity to talk to him about his open
                    disagreement. Some reporters apparently got to him during a flight back and got
                    him to talk. I think perhaps he was “setup” and may not have recognized the trap
                    he was falling into. On the other hand, he may have been fully conscious of what
                    he was doing; I don't know. It was an unusual and awkward situation for all of
                    us.</p>
                <p>In late 1976, Stilwell left and was replaced by General Jack Vessey. It was a
                    magical change. I remember going to the military welcoming ceremony, including a
                    major parade. As is customary, the press office of the Command had issued a
                    biographic sketch of the incoming CINC. I was struck by the fact the Vessey,
                    although having started as a private in the Army during WW II, had only become a
                    general 6 years earlier, and here he was with four stars on his shoulders! He
                    was really a late bloomer; once he had gotten that first star, the rest came
                    quickly. That was very impressive. I was even more impressed when within a week,
                    there was a noticeable change in the relationship between the Embassy and the
                    CINC. There was first of all a very noticeable change in the relationships
                    between the principals; deep suspicions, anger, open confrontations had been
                    replaced by a close working relationship. I attribute this change essentially to
                    Vessey's diplomatic and personal skills. He was a “soldier's soldier”—having
                    risen from the ranks; he was one of the nicest human beings I have ever known
                    and a great diplomat. In my experience, he was the finest soldier I have ever
                    met. I have always felt, in somewhat simplistic terms, that Vessey was an “Omar
                    Bradley” kind of guy. He was greatly respected and highly regarded by his men
                    and ever loved.</p>
                <p>Stilwell was an “intellectual” general—a planner; Vessey was both smart and
                    charming and a man devoted to his troops—a leader. He had tremendous breadth and
                    scope in his abilities; he was disarmingly simple and straight. He always used
                    to say, after receiving a long and detailed briefing about some battle plan,
                    “Gentlemen, all these plans sound very good and they are well thought out, but
                    they do not take into account the smoke on the battlefield!” As Vessey well
                    knew, there were always unpredictable circumstances that arise in the chaos of
                    battle. That is not a new insight, but to me as a young Foreign Service officer,
                    it struck me as much more pertinent than the analysis that the staff had
                    prepared and worked on for weeks and months. Vessey was both sensible and
                    sensitive. He was always very nice to me personally, although as the Political
                    Counselor, I was junior in the pecking order; we used to play golf together from
                    time to time and he was a great companion.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I am sure that the Stilwell-Sneider problem had become widely known in
                    Washington. I remember one series of exchanges between General Brown, the JCS
                    Chairman at the time, and Sneider. Brown, after receiving a complaint from
                    Sneider had said that he had understood Dick's problems and suggested that he
                    just be patient and firm with Stilwell, who as the good soldier that he was,
                    would take orders if they were clearly and firmly expressed. I suspect that the
                    JCS had also sent a message to Stilwell urging him to be more cooperative. I
                    assume that Vessey was well briefed on the explosive nature of the relationship
                    between the two American principals in Seoul and undoubtedly applied all of his
                    skills to smoothing the waters as soon as he landed. He made a major effort to
                    give Sneider control over those matters that the Ambassador clearly felt fell
                    into his province; he also accorded the Ambassador respect and recognition that
                    in Seoul, the American Ambassador was the senior US representative. That was key
                    issue with Sneider; as long as his self-perception of his role was recognized,
                    he was content. There was a lot of ego at stake. Vessey handled him
                    beautifully.</p>
                <p>I should note that my relationships with the military did not change when I
                    became Political Counselor. In fact, I probably took the politico-military job
                    with me. I did that in part because I thought that by that time, I had learned a
                    lot about the military situation and had made a lot of friends among the
                    officers. I enjoyed playing golf and was reasonably good in those days; so I
                    would periodically be asked to join a group of senior military men. The military
                    had started a tradition of an early Tuesday morning golf game—which met on
                    Thursdays when it didn't play on Saturday—which brought US and Korean senior
                    officers together in an informal setting. I was invited to join that group which
                    helped both to firm up the personal relationships. Furthermore, I was the
                    official Embassy contact with the CINC's Chief of Staff. So I saw a lot of the
                    US military in my four years in Seoul.</p>
                <p>I should also mention, that as the Politico-Military officer, I had developed a
                    process which would allow me to be at military headquarters whenever any
                    potential trouble might arise, such as an incident at the DMZ. Regardless of the
                    time of day or night, if there was trouble brewing, I would be alerted and able
                    to be at headquarters to be the Embassy's “eyes and ears”. That, I think, was a
                    valuable service that I provided. It was particularly important during the 1976
                    “tree cutting” incident, which was a seminal event. But there were other, too
                    frequent, incidents on the border or on the seas. My presence enabled the
                    Ambassador to be up to date on events as they unfolded. I continued this
                    practice even after I became Political Counselor, even though another officer
                    was assigned to the Section; I gave him other assignments and essentially kept
                    the politico-military portfolio for myself. I had developed in the preceding
                    years good close contacts in the US military and I enjoyed that job.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I need to go back in history a little to understand the evolution of my
                    assignments in Korea in the 1973-77 period. As I mentioned, I came as the
                    Politico-Military officer working for the Political Counselor, Dan O'Donahue. He
                    left about a year later to join Phil Habib in Washington and was replaced by Ed
                    Hurwitz. That was somewhat of a blow to me because I had hoped to be designated
                    as Political Counselor at the time. I was behind my classmates, in part because
                    of the unfortunate efficiency ratings that I had received earlier in my career,
                    which I have mentioned previously. Having had been in Seoul for a year and
                    having performed quite satisfactorily, I thought I was the logical candidate to
                    be the Political Counselor. I thought I could have handled it adequately. So I
                    made a bid for the job with Dick Ericson—one of the few times in my career when
                    I “volunteered” for an assignment. But the job was given to Hurwitz, who, I was
                    told, was a first rate language officer whom Phil Habib felt should be rewarded
                    for acquiring that language skill. That was probably the right policy, although,
                    as I said, I was disappointed at the time.</p>
                <p>But Ed, because of personal problems, only stayed for a year. So the job was open
                    again in the summer of 1975. I think Sneider, at that time, was tempted to bring
                    in a new Counselor—Bill Clark, I believe, then in Japan—, but that apparently
                    did not work out and I think Ericson put in a good word for me and the job was
                    given to me.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Hurwitz' language skills. I had no knowledge of Korean when I went to
                    Seoul, but I started to take morning classes. Dan O'Donohue advised me to take
                    the 100 sentence course which would have enabled me to do routine activities in
                    Korea—market shopping, travel, etc.—, but he suggested that I not try to become
                    bilingual because Korean was so difficult that I would just be frustrated. I
                    think that was good advice. I tried to learn Korean for eight years—both
                    tours—and by the end I could speak enough for every day conversation—Kisaeng
                    House Korean—, but I don't believe I could have carried on a very substantive
                    dialogue. I tried very hard, and enjoyed trying, but...I remember standing in a
                    hotel lobby one day, listening to a group of German tourists being briefed on
                    their day's sightseeing. It had been twenty years since I had heard German to
                    any great extent, but I was able to understand that much better than the Korean
                    I had learned. I don't think my investment in Korean paid sufficient dividends.
                    I would call my Korean “survival”; it enabled me to navigate in day-to-day
                    activities, but not beyond that.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I might interject at this stage a comment about the JUSMAAG (The Joint US
                    Military Assistance Group) and its organizational situation. The chiefs were
                    two-star generals—some better than others—, but all quite satisfactory. Both
                    O.D. Street and Harry Griffith were fine officers—the latter is a friend to this
                    day. But JUSMAAG was always an organizational problem. The Chief reported to the
                    Ambassador from whom he received his substantive marching orders. On the other
                    hand, he was an Army general who lived with the other US military officers on
                    the US base at Yongsan, whose efficiency report was written by the CINC. So the
                    JUSMAAG Chief had two bosses to satisfy, which is not easy particularly when the
                    two principals were barely speaking to each other as in Sneider/Stilwell days. I
                    think we in the Embassy were well aware of the Chief's dilemma and tried to make
                    matters as easy as possible. The working situation improved when Jack Vessey
                    came, but it was inherently an impossible organizational situation: reporting to
                    one boss for policy guidance and another for efficiency rating purposes. That is
                    bound to be a recipe for problems and in fact that this what happened
                    periodically, with the MAAG Chief being in the middle.</p>
                <p>As I said earlier, my contacts with the Korean military were far fewer than those
                    with the American, partly because the US military was working with their
                    counterparts daily and party because I think the Korean officers were somewhat
                    leery of the Embassy. So my contacts with the Korean military were mostly
                    social—on the golf course, at Kisaeng houses, etc. On the issue of military
                    sales, although we had a large and effective JUSMAAG, I did participate a little
                    more actively both with the ROK military and defense officials, who were
                    civilians. We did have politico-military issues in these sales programs, both in
                    terms of Korean wishes and the process itself—who would pay, what technology
                    might be transferred. We gave the Koreans large amounts of technology, which
                    although perhaps not state-of-the-art, was much further advanced than they
                    themselves could develop. They “reversed engineered” some of our products,
                    enabling their R&amp;D to progress much further and faster than it might have
                    otherwise.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Although military sales was not perhaps the focus of my attention most of the
                    time, I do remember that they were a concern. The Koreans always wanted to get
                    the best equipment they could get for the least money. They also wanted the
                    rights to manufacture their own versions of some of the equipment; e.g. tanks,
                    guns, etc.—without paying royalties if possible—the biggest bang for the least
                    cost. They were very good at reverse engineering and copying their military
                    acquisitions. The JUSMAAG and the US military were probably more inclined to be
                    forthcoming in satisfying Korean requests—”the brotherhood” of the military. I
                    probably overstate the case, but the JUSMAAG sometimes seemed willing to provide
                    anything at practically no cost. We in the Embassy and in the State Department
                    in Washington were considerably more cautious and restrictive both in the kinds
                    of equipment we would release and the costs. There was some pressure from
                    American companies on us to be responsive to Korean requests; they wanted to
                    make the sales. But I think we in general held the line to limit Korean access
                    to capabilities which they did not really need to have for defensive purposes;
                    in any case, in the event of hostilities, these were capabilities that our own
                    military could provide very quickly. The Koreans of course resented this US
                    military checkrein.</p>
                <p>Related to this question of sales, there were other policy issues concerning the
                    introduction of certain kinds of military operations and equipment into Korea.
                    The one issue which separated me from the US military was that of “aggressive
                    behavior.” Stilwell, as I suggested, was quite aggressive in his war plans. In
                    exercises, he brought B-52s to Korea, flying them up from Guam. He flew them
                    close to the DMZ. I didn't believe that this was a necessary act; it threatened
                    the North unnecessarily. I recognized that the hard-liners wanted to make the
                    point that if the North ever considered an invasion, the total might of the US
                    forces could be brought to bear on it. I had no reason to believe however that
                    the North did not already understand that and thought that the provocative use
                    of B-52s was unnecessary and “over the line.” I also had personal reservations
                    about the introduction of battlefield nuclear capable missiles. Stilwell was
                    able to convince the Pentagon to bring a battery of Lance missiles to Korea;
                    these were dual use missiles that could carry either regular or nuclear
                    warheads. Vessey supported that concept, but I was opposed. It was a capability
                    that I did not think absolutely necessary; nuclear weapons, whether strategic or
                    theater, should be introduced with great care and only after a careful analysis
                    which would have concluded that they were absolutely necessary. I felt
                    therefore, under the circumstances existing in Korea at the time—i.e. no sign of
                    immediate threat—the introduction of Lance was unnecessarily provocative. I
                    think I even would probably have objected to their use in a war situation,
                    except as a matter of last resort. In the late 1970s, we were in Korea for
                    defensive purposes; we were there to react to a provocation, and not in the
                    business of starting a fight. The introduction of Lance, I think raised a
                    question of our policy; those missiles might well be considered as an offensive
                    capability, particularly in the paranoid mind of the North Korean leadership. I
                    think those missiles, just as the B-52s, were provocative.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>“Team Spirit”, which was a large joint US-ROK exercise that went on for weeks,
                    was the center piece of our military activities on the Peninsula. It kept
                    getting larger and larger while I was in Korea; I have already mentioned the
                    inclusion of the B-52s. We brought the 25th division from Hawaii, so that much
                    of the exercise was devoted to the logistical problems of ferrying whole
                    division from thousands of miles away. I didn't have too much trouble with the
                    concept of a joint exercise, but I was bothered by its increasing scope. It
                    began to raise a question in mind about the rationale for the exercise and its
                    importance. It is true that the North Korean military capacity was growing in
                    this period, but I had considerable concern whether the appropriate response to
                    that activity was an ever larger joint US-ROK exercise which included
                    increasingly provocative aspects. Some of it could be justified, but I often
                    wondered whether we weren't “crossing the line.”</p>
                <p>As for civic affairs, fortunately, the Koreans at the time were so appreciative
                    of our efforts that we did not have many problems with farmers whose land was
                    thoroughly trampled or authorities whose roads may have been wrecked by our
                    tanks. They accommodated us to a very large degree and were quite forgiving for
                    the damage that our troops undoubtedly inflicted on their property. What
                    problems were raised were addressed in the SOFA Committee which I left after
                    becoming Political Counselor. Usually, appropriate compensation was quickly
                    dispensed keeping the political damage of these exercises at a minimum. Of
                    course the total government control of the press and exclusures of publication
                    on these matters helped immeasurably.</p>
                <p>I think it is natural that an Embassy always wants more intelligence on the host
                    government's military plans and efforts than it is able to obtain. Korea was no
                    exception to this rule and there were times when we could certainly have used
                    more intelligence. I remember Phil Habib—a very knowledgeable and wise observer
                    of the Koreans—saying that Koreans were very open and friendly, but that if they
                    want to keep some information to themselves they were very skilled in keeping it
                    from us. I think there were many things going on within the Korean military that
                    we never found out about or only found out about after they had occurred.
                    Moreover, I had the feeling—despite my high regard for my military
                    colleagues—that both military organizations—US and ROK—did not share all their
                    knowledge with the Embassy. I cannot say that we were ever lied to, especially
                    after Vessey became the CINC, but whether all information was shared was a
                    different question. Jack Vessey was particularly good at giving us some insights
                    into the ROK military process; the fact that he shared information with the
                    Ambassador was salutary all the way down the line; my own US military
                    counterparts became more forthcoming. Vessey made a real effort to become better
                    acquainted with the ROK military; he actually learned some Korean and used to
                    give speeches, or parts of speeches, in Korean. Jack, when he was a Lieutenant
                    Colonel, almost left the military and became a Presbyterian minister; he was a
                    genuine, decent gentleman. He will always stand out in my memory as one of the
                    finest individuals I have ever met. I once remarked at a farewell dinner, when I
                    returned to Korea as DCM a few years later, that Jack Vessey taught me more
                    about being a diplomat than anyone in the Foreign Service had done.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Let me return to the issue of what we knew about the Korean military. I had a
                    pretty good sense about how the process worked; how promotions and assignments
                    were made; who were the rising stars and who were “over the hill.” The potential
                    stars were usually spotted when they were still relatively junior
                    officers-captains or majors. Private companies had similar systems. They had
                    invariably shined in schools and in their first assignments. They would be given
                    some of the plusher assignments that a company might have to offer and unless
                    they took a misstep somewhere along the line, they would rise to the top. The
                    ROK military had a similar practice. I never heard “buying” promotions by any
                    officers, I had always assumed that that merit and their backgrounds probably
                    were sufficient. The “comers” certainly had better assignments. But in light of
                    today's headlines—the Rho Tae Woo and Chun Doo Hwan bribery scandals—one has to
                    wonder whether the promotions were made entirely on merit or connections. I
                    think it was the consensus at the time I was in Korea in the American official
                    community that some ROK military officers were doing well because they were
                    being paid by private firms—for unspecified “services.” But I think no one
                    really felt that promotions were subject to bribery; they were made on merit.
                    That I think distinguished the Korean military from some of its Asian
                    counterparts, where the assumption was always that officers bought their way
                    into general officers' billets. I always thought that the Koreans had not
                    engaged in those practices because in fact the security of the nation depended
                    on a well disciplined and effective military organization. Corruption under
                    those circumstances could have been very damaging.</p>
                <p>As in Japan and other countries, senior officials—civilian and military—were
                    taken care of after their retirements by being offered plushy jobs in the
                    private sector. Some of these retirees may well have been on the payroll of the
                    private industry even before retirement. One of my close Korean friends
                    described this process to me one day in some detail. On New Year's Day, the
                    Chaebols—the large private megafirms—would go to the offices of the senior
                    officials and leave a white envelope. It was a custom well known and accepted by
                    society.</p>
                <p>The custom of providing retirement jobs for senior military and civilian
                    officials undoubtedly had the support of Park Chung Hee. It reduced the chances
                    for mischief by unemployed generals—a concern that must have weighted on Park's
                    mind who was well aware of the potential of a coup that might oust him. After
                    all, that was the way he had come to power in 1961. It was therefore to his
                    advantage to see to it that loyal senior officials and officers were taken care
                    of in their retirement years. A happy, well paid person, even if retried from
                    his first career, is not likely to jeopardize what in some cases was a rather
                    plush second career by biting the hand that fed him. In fact, I am sure that the
                    private sector gained from these employments as well, not only as a sign of its
                    generosity for those who “played ball” with it during their governmental
                    service, but also from some skills and contacts that these retired generals and
                    officials brought with them to their new assignments. This “safety net”
                    retirement process fit neatly the Korean culture with its emphasis on
                    meritocracy and taking care of the seniors. As I said, to the best of my
                    knowledge, promotions in the military were not due to pay-offs; it was a system
                    based on performance and therefore those who rose high in the ranks were “the
                    best and the brightest.”</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I have mentioned “Kisaeng” houses on a couple of occasions. I should perhaps
                    explain a little about what they were and the role they played in the social
                    life of Korea. “Kisaeng” houses were male bastions where men let their “hair
                    down—in the company of usually very attractive young female hostesses. The
                    Americans could not afford to go to these places, so we were always the guests
                    of Foreign Ministry officials, sometimes the military and sometimes private
                    sector people. I used to go two-three times each month. Some people would
                    describe them as wild drunken orgies. Most of the time was devoted to eating,
                    drinking, singing and playing games. Most of the stuff was in fact not very
                    wild; I would describe the atmosphere more as warm and friendly. But these
                    parties also served a serious purpose; I got to know a lot of Koreans that way.
                    We as American officials, were in some respect their “rice bowls.” We were the
                    excuse for them to enjoy themselves at the government's expense—the
                    entertainment expense account. It is true that two or three drinks—and there
                    were often more—tended to lower whatever social inhibitions might exist across
                    cultural and personal lines. I don't believe that any great state secrets were
                    made public in this fashion, but undoubtedly things were said that might not
                    have been said in a formal office situation. But for most Americans it was a
                    survival course. Unfortunately, I sometimes remembered the following day what
                    had gone on to my dismay and chagrin. I had always understood Japanese Geisha
                    affairs to be sedate and formal occasions where the “hostesses” were usually
                    much more advanced in age than the Korean ones and where these women played
                    instruments and were really formal entertainment. Kisaeng girls on the other
                    hand were young and vibrant and their only job was to see that their “guests”
                    had a good time. For the most part, the men sat cross legged on the floor and
                    large amounts of different food dishes were served. The booze was forced on you
                    through toasts or contests; the Koreans would constantly fill your glass and ask
                    you to join them in some kind of “bottom ups” ceremony. The guest was made to
                    feel that he had to drink to be courteous. If you had a good Kisaeng companion,
                    who was trying to be helpful, she would fill your glass with barley water, which
                    looked like Scotch, but was non-alcoholic; that helped me on many occasions.
                    Sometimes the girls would actually drink the booze on your behalf; that was also
                    helpful. Some of them would drink along with the men and would be drunk by the
                    end of the evening; some of them were drunk quite often—which was not very good
                    for their health. I think it fair to say that the American wives did not like to
                    have their husbands go off to Kisaeng parties. They did not appreciate either
                    the nature of the occasions nor the fact that they were left out entirely. I
                    think in some cases they felt their marriage threatened and in some cases they
                    were indeed correct. I think there were Americans males who actually did enjoy
                    these occasions; it was a heady experience, if I can use that term; the American
                    was wined and dined with a young lady at his side. That was a different
                    experience, although I know many Americans who did not enjoy Kisaeng parties;
                    they particularly resented the amount of booze they were asked to consume.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The “Kisaeng” parties were one form of social occasions hosted by the Koreans,
                    but the normal kind of social activity was much more frequent. We did a fair
                    amount of entertainment at home and we also were invited to Korean homes. That I
                    found one of the nice aspects of Korean life; they did invite us to their
                    homes—more perhaps than was true in other countries where I served. Sometimes we
                    would be invited to regular restaurants along with our wives. So the social life
                    in Seoul was very active.</p>
                <p>Let me now make few comments about other aspects of my job as Political
                    Counselor. First: relations with the Station. When I first became Political
                    Counselor, the Station Chief was Dan Arnold with whom I got along reasonably
                    well because I made a major effort to build a cooperative relationship. He lived
                    next door to me in Compound II. He was a strange duck; he had been a “big wheel”
                    in the Washington headquarters and was even bigger in Laos and Thailand after
                    his Seoul tour. His predecessor was Don Gregg, who was a great guy and a
                    personal friend even today. Arnold was succeeded by Bob Grealy, another
                    outstanding officer, who is also a friend of Carter's and mine to this day. I
                    used to introduce Bob as Don Gregg's successor; that would give pause to the
                    audience who knew that that was not factually true, but after a few seconds
                    understood the meaning of my comment. Arnold was in general held in relatively
                    low esteem by the Koreans; he didn't know Korean, was not sympathetic to Korea.
                    I remember him roaring into my office one day, completely upset about something
                    that he felt the Koreans were doing to him. He was a Southeast Asia expert and I
                    think felt quite uncomfortable in his Korean surroundings. He was a “fish out of
                    water” in Seoul.</p>
                <p>Dan Arnold or one of his staff members was at the intelligence center at Yongsan
                    when we had a serious incident at the DMZ. I rushed to the center myself, but
                    before I had even arrived, Arnold had heard of the incident and had reported it
                    to Washington in a CRITIC message—one of the most sensitive designation in the
                    US government's telegram classification system. It is used—or should be
                    used—only in the rare cases when a major crisis is about to erupt. It would have
                    alerted all the bureaucrats in Washington. I found out about Arnold's premature
                    report and reported it to Ambassador Sneider. As you can well imagine, Sneider
                    did not take it kindly; he didn't like Arnold to begin with and that report was
                    almost the “straw that broke the camel's back.” He immediately called Arnold in
                    and chewed him out. In the first place, the message designator was grossly
                    over-stated; secondly, operational messages on overt activities of a military
                    nature should not be sent through CIA channels; and thirdly, I think Sneider—and
                    I agree with him on this—felt that such a message should never had been sent
                    without his concurrence. Arnold lasted less than a year; his career was not
                    damaged by his stint in Seoul, but it was not a happy experience either for him
                    or the Embassy or the Koreans.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>On the other hand, there were many positive things one could say about the CIA
                    Station in Seoul. It was well staffed, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
                    During my tour, they were tremendously helpful on a number of occasions. I never
                    really worked with Don Gregg because as political-military officer, I really had
                    no reason to have a professional relationship, but the Greggs were our next door
                    neighbors, so that we got to know them well and I came to admire them. Don was
                    an outstanding officer who went on to an illustrious career and eventually came
                    back to Seoul in the late '80s as Ambassador. I did work with Bob Grealy because
                    by that time (1976), I was the Political Counselor. Bob taught me more about
                    what a good Station does than anyone else ever had, and I was extremely grateful
                    to him for all the lessons. He was also a genuinely nice guy and a very capable
                    leader of his team. He was extremely useful in ferreting out political
                    information about what was going on behind the scenes in South Korea which was
                    very useful to us; that was information that we would not have otherwise
                    acquired and helped us better understand the sometime “inscrutable” Koreans. I
                    felt that Grealy and his staff were quite open with me with the information they
                    had collected. I remember once asking Bob to have his people stay away from the
                    political section's opposition friends; they were so eager to tell us openly
                    whatever we wanted to know and it was silly for the Station to go after that
                    information. Bob maintained that eventually these opposition leaders might come
                    to power and therefore he should know them. I didn't want them to be tagged as
                    CIA informers, however. This debate was indicative of the problems the US
                    government encounters sometimes as it tries to develop the best understanding it
                    can of political developments.</p>
                <p>I did have someone in the Political Section who over a period of time cultivated
                    many good contacts in the opposition. That was John La Mazza, the Labor officer.
                    His contacts with the opposition were not necessarily part of his job
                    description, but once he had established them, I encouraged him to proceed
                    because he provided much useful information and some excellent analysis. Our
                    relationship with the opposition in the late 1970s was somewhat tentative, but
                    continual. My view was that the US was supporting the ROK government and people
                    in so many different ways that we had a right to know what was going on the
                    country; we were in Seoul not just to hear the well rehearsed “official party”
                    line, but also to understand other points of view; we had the right, in my view,
                    to talk to any Korean citizen. This view was part and parcel to my general view
                    of human rights. I never thought that it was useful to give public support to
                    Kim Dae Jung or other dissidents; it would not have been helpful to do so to
                    anyone, particularly to the dissidents who already were being watched very
                    carefully on their contacts with Americans. But I did insist that it was proper
                    and indeed our job to talk to the opposition. Accordingly, I saw Kim Dae Jung
                    regularly during this period.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>We had indirect contact with university students through their professors. One of
                    them, Kim Se Jung, was a professor of Constitutional Law at Seoul National
                    University. Dan O'Donahue described him to me as a “cult figure.” I inherited
                    him as a contact from Dan. Physically, he was totally inept—a round man. I
                    remember once when he tried to wrestle a Kisaeng girl to the floor. It was one
                    of the more memorable comic experiences I had in Seoul. But he was an extremely
                    intelligent, sensitive person who was clearly in opposition. He and others were
                    able to keep us up to date on the mood of the university students. So we had a
                    pretty good feel for the campus moods, which in Korea, in the '70s were an
                    important barometer. It is true that in the period we are discussing, the
                    students were more quiescent than they were in the following decades, but even
                    in the 1970s they would periodically show their displeasure with some
                    governmental action or their anti-Japanese feelings. They rarely displayed
                    anti-American views at that time.</p>
                <p>In Seoul I ran into a curious coincidence. I had two Yale classmates living
                    there. One was Steve Bradner, who was a civilian political analyst working for
                    the CINC; another one was Ed Poitras, a liberal Methodist missionary. Ed knew a
                    lot about what was going on in the opposition; we met frequently and exchanged
                    views and information and maintained a good relationship even though he was not
                    always fond of US policy. I also met other American missionaries, almost all of
                    whom were anti-Park. I saw some Korean dissidents—e.g.”Springtime” Kim. On one
                    occasion I really pushed my policy of seeing the opposition. I consciously
                    decided to attend a meeting of dissident leaders which was being held in sort of
                    a tea house. I think they were very surprised by my appearance, but I thought it
                    was a very useful way to send a message to the government about our intentions;
                    going to such a meeting also prevented the government from taking retaliatory
                    action against a single individual, which was always a risk if the Korean
                    associated with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I don't recall ever being told by the government to cease and desist my contacts
                    with the opposition. The ROKG may have made some protests to the Ambassador or
                    the DCM, but I was certainly not aware of any complaints. As I said earlier, I
                    saw Kim Dae Jung. We had a major interest in his welfare. Phil Habib's
                    intervention saved his life after he was kidnaped by the KCIA from a Tokyo
                    hotel. I remember that as I was making my first call on Kim—this was right after
                    his release from jail—it suddenly occurred to me as we—I had one of my junior
                    staff members with me—were on our way that I had not cleared this visit with
                    Ambassador Sneider. I went ahead anyway and had a long conversation with Kim
                    during which I took copious notes. As soon as I returned to the Embassy, I went
                    to see Sneider; I told him that I had just done something that I should have
                    discussed with him first. I apologized. Sneider agreed that I should have told
                    him first, but he was not angry at that time. Later, when I sent a report on a
                    subsequent meeting with Kim, Sneider really got mad. I had reported on our
                    conversation is some detail, but I had commented at the end that obviously what
                    Kim had said had to be taken with a grain of salt since he had an axe to grind.
                    This did not appease Sneider. His comment was that Kim was just a political hack
                    whose comments were not worthy of reporting to Washington. That really upset me;
                    I threw my notebook down and shouted at Sneider that Kim Dae Jung was not a
                    “political hack”; that he was the recognized leader of the Korean opposition and
                    that regardless of the merit of Kim's comments, they had to be reported. Sneider
                    was not a great fan of Kim nor many of the dissidents, as a mater of fact. I had
                    more problems on the subject of contacts with the opposition from my Ambassador
                    than I had from the Koreans. Nevertheless Sneider saw opposition leaders himself
                    from time to time; he was better at that than one of his successors, Dixie
                    Walker. Dick saw them when he wanted to send a message to the government or to
                    the opposition, although he was always quite careful which members of the
                    opposition he did see. I don't remember for example him ever seeing Kim Dae
                    Jung. On the other hand I saw Kim, both at his house and ours. We had a golden
                    retriever and I remember Kim coming the first time and when he saw our dog, he
                    began to shake visibly. That surprised me because the dog was very placid, but
                    apparently Kim was afraid of dogs.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The only one that I guess was really safe to see was Cardinal Kim, whom I saw
                    periodically—three or four ties a year. I thought the Cardinal was the wisest
                    observer in Korea on domestic political issues. But you had to listen very
                    carefully to what he said because he was a careful speaker; once I got to know
                    him better, he was much easier to understand. He was a very important figure in
                    Korea. He knew what was going on; the students and the younger generation would
                    come to his Cathedral as did the opposition leaders; so he was extremely well
                    informed and therefore a unique source. In addition to reporting the views of
                    the opposition, Cardinal Kim was a keen analyst. Whenever the students were
                    beginning to reach the brink of their patience, he felt that and he moved in
                    their direction. As the Pope's senior representative in Korea, Cardinal Kim's
                    primary goal was to maintain a Catholic presence in Korea; so despite his own
                    predilections, he was always careful with his words lest they damage his
                    Church's standing. The Papal Nuncio, on the other hand, was an outright devotee
                    of the Korean government. Cardinal Kim was recognized as a political force, and
                    I always found his insights worthy of reporting to Washington. He was an
                    important figure at the center of much political activity in Korea.</p>
                <p>In the 1975-77 period, I rarely saw Kim Young Sam, the present President of
                    Korea; I did see him frequently during my next tour in Seoul. But during that
                    tour, I hardly ever saw Kim Dae Jung. In the case of Kim Dae Jung, in the late
                    1970s it was relatively easy to see him without running risk of damaging him or
                    us further with government—as long as the contact was being conducted by the
                    Political Counselor and not any of his superiors. In the 1980s, when I was the
                    DCM, it would have been riskier for me see Kim Dae Jung then; it would have been
                    greatly resented by then President Chun Doo Hwan. So during my tour as DCM, we
                    made the conscious decision that for me to see Kim Dae Jung would have been
                    inappropriate and risky for him. What contacts we had with Kim then were
                    conducted by our Political Counselor, David Blakemore. In the '80s Kim was not
                    so important an opposition contact as he had been in the late 1970s.</p>

                <p>One of the very interesting characters that I met in the late 1970s was Chung Il
                    Kwan, then the Speaker of the National Assembly. He was a man who had held every
                    top job in Korea except that of President. Secondly, he was an exceedingly
                    gracious gentleman—he was as pleasant and as a nice as anyone I ever met in
                    Seoul, not only to me but to all Americans. I think he was an extremely
                    effective politician in the Korean context, although he never ran for office. He
                    was well liked by most; he was always surrounded by an entourage of
                    followers—the famous “Tuesday Golf” game that I mentioned earlier was
                    essentially a Chung creation. But despite his Buddha-like exterior, you had the
                    feeling that he was probably a ruthless man. There were many stories about his
                    misdeeds, including one about a young lady who he had sent to her death at an
                    earlier stage of his life—she was pregnant and probably had tried to extort
                    something out of Chung. He had served as Army Chief of Staff three times and
                    undoubtedly had learned some lessons in brutality from those experiences. Chung
                    was also considered corrupt and corrupting. I can remember a young opposition
                    politician—Oh Se Young—(a personal friend) playing golf with Chung and coming
                    back five hundred dollar richer. Chung always let these young politicians win
                    their golf games and always paid them off—enough so they could have a good time
                    that evening. But I am sure that he was involved in much larger corrupt schemes.
                    The Chairman of Hyundai, Chung Ju Jung, was close to the Speaker and must have
                    financed him.</p>
                <p>The economic assistance program was essentially phasing out while I was in Seoul
                    and was not much of a factor in our strategy. USIA which occupied a building
                    several blocks away from the Chancery was headed by experienced PAO's. They also
                    had three branch offices throughout South Korea, which were useful in bringing
                    the US to cities other than Seoul. There was also an active program to engage
                    University students which I thought was useful. So there were parts of the USIA
                    program that were important, although I think in general, the Agency perhaps was
                    not as influential on the Korean scene as other US programs like military
                    assistance. Security issues were paramount in Korea and USIA is not a very good
                    foreign policy instrument in such a setting. I think we were also limited in our
                    outreach program because fluency in Korean was absolutely essential and there
                    were not that many officers in the Embassy—me included—that could satisfy that
                    requirement.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I should make some comments about my external contacts. I had never worked as a
                    political officer and therefore learned on the job. I developed a good
                    relationship with Philip Choi who was a brother of another good friend of ours.
                    Philip was in the office of the “Protocol Chief” to the President of the ROK and
                    therefore was very knowledgeable about what was going on in the Blue House. I
                    suspect that protocol had very little to do with his job; he was more likely to
                    have been a liaison officer with the KCIA. I also met one or two of the younger
                    Blue House secretaries—[the name given to staffers], usually on social occasions
                    which I would then follow up with regular business contact. These contacts did
                    give me some fodder for some of my reports, although these guys were obviously
                    quite circumspect. It was my impression that the Blue House ran quite
                    efficiently; I always had the feeling that the cream of the Korean brain power
                    worked at the top of the bureaucracy and in the Blue House. They knew precisely
                    what they were doing. Of course, Korea not being a democracy reduced the amount
                    of debates on issues; the President would decide and his staff would carry out
                    his orders. After becoming the Political Counselor, I had several opportunities
                    to see Park Chung Hee because I was the note taker at the meetings he held with
                    the Ambassador. There was no question who was in charge; clearly everyone
                    marched to Park's tune. As a newcomer to meetings with Chiefs of State, there
                    was a certain aura and atmosphere about being in the presence of the President;
                    it left a definite impression. Park was a stern, severe person; his military
                    demeanor never left him. I also remember Park as being very quick; if he wanted
                    to answer an Ambassadorial question, he would do so incisively and directly; he
                    didn't ramble and gave a succinct and responsive answer. Park was smart, but not
                    a friendly and warm type.</p>
                <p>I had some contact with the neutral observers on the Armistice Commission,
                    especially the Swedes and the Swiss. We used to see them socially quite often.
                    As time went on, we also became acquainted with the Polish and Czech members.
                    That was useful to us because they were in constant contact with the North
                    Koreans and could provide some insights into the mentality of the forces on the
                    other side of the DMZ. The Commission, staffed by representatives of “neutral”
                    countries, was established to monitor the armistice. It could not enforce the
                    provisions of the treaty, but it did have oversight responsibility and reported
                    violations to both sides. In some cases, the Commission was useful in mediating
                    some sticky points or situations. It would be used by both sides as a message
                    transmission belt. In one case that I remember (in the '80s), the Swedish
                    delegate played a personal physical role in saving the lives of some North
                    Korean soldiers who had invaded the “Peace Village” at Panmunjom. They were in
                    pursuit of a Russian defector—a diplomat—and crossed the border in their effort
                    to stop the defection. As soon as they crossed the line, they were pinned down
                    by South Korean forces. So the North soldiers fond themselves in a little
                    depression in the ground surrounded by the South Koreans. It was very tense
                    situation which could have easily resulted in casualties. Fortunately, the
                    Swedish delegate stepped in and rescued the North Koreans before any damage was
                    done, much to his own peril.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>During my tour as Political Counselor, I had a little contact with some American
                    correspondents, such as Don Oberdorfer, Dick Halloran and Sam Jameson. All of
                    these correspondents were based in Tokyo, but would periodically come to Seoul
                    and drop in on me for update briefings. Only the “Wall Street Journal” had a
                    resident correspondent and I of course saw him frequently. All my briefings were
                    “on background”—i.e. not for attribution—and focused primarily on the Korean
                    domestic scene, with some reference, when called for, on the military situation.
                    I was as forthcoming as possible when the correspondents would call on me. In
                    general, Sneider encouraged these press briefings; I never felt any constraints.
                    The only time I ever felt any restriction was when Habib was Ambassador. He was
                    a curious mixture of greatness and pettiness. At one time, there was a press
                    description about some event in Seoul that didn't fit his views of the
                    situation; then Phil almost made the Embassy out of bounds for correspondents. I
                    didn't have any argument at the time with Habib's reaction; as a matter of fact,
                    at the time I was somewhat surprised that ambassadors had been as open with
                    press as many of them were. As time went on, I learned that talking to the press
                    was of benefit. A closed embassy was bound to be pilloried in the press; that
                    might have been more trouble than it was worth.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a little about our policies toward Korea in 1975-77. I have already
                    indicated that our major objective was to deter any attack on South Korea. It
                    was clear that Habib's maxim “if war breaks out, the US has lost” was still our
                    cardinal rule. We recognized that Korea was the most volatile area of the world
                    and the most likely to be the casus belli if there was one anywhere. There were
                    other points such as Berlin, but the major powers had much greater control of
                    situations of that kind than they had in Korea. The unpredictable nature of the
                    situation particularly of the North was a matter of great concern. As I have
                    said, I had some degree of confidence that the North was not about to launch a
                    major offensive; that was based primarily on the US maintenance of a credible
                    deterrence; it required the US to be seen as staunch and firm in purpose. I had
                    absolutely no quarrel with our basic objective; I had always understood it even
                    before coming to Korea and there was nothing that I saw in the three years that
                    changed my mind. I believed in our basic purpose and do so still today. That is
                    the reason that I had serious doubts about President Carter's troop withdrawal
                    policy. Sneider's approach—i.e. to say to the President that if he had really
                    decided to withdraw the troops, then there were ways to minimize the damage—I
                    now view as probably misguided. I didn't at the time, but in retrospect, Sneider
                    probably should have said “No way.” Vessey, as I heard, actually returned to
                    Washington and had a meeting with the President during which he outlined all the
                    reasons why troop withdrawal was a very dangerous policy. He was up front about
                    his opposition to troop withdrawal. As I said, in retrospect, I think Vessey's
                    approach was far better than Sneider's, but at the time, I probably was too
                    deferential to the Ambassador because I was still a relatively new boy on the
                    block and had not had enough experience with Far East security issues to be able
                    to muster a telling counter-argument to Sneider's approach. I think most of us
                    just followed our leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I have already alluded to our human rights policy. I felt then as I did when I
                    returned to Korea in the early 1980s that the protection of human rights was an
                    important issue for the US, particularly as it impinged on people's rights to
                    achieve a democratic society. People have the right to be the masters of their
                    own fate and we were completely justified in supporting such aspirations. I
                    always opposed the repressive measures that the Korean military sometimes took,
                    which resulted in people jumping to their deaths out of windows, or the KCIA
                    kidnaping of Kim Dae Jung. Those actions were beyond the pale and I found myself
                    quite angry at such brutal Korean measures. On the other hand, I did not believe
                    that active US public promotion of human rights, which tended to embarrass a
                    foreign government, was the most effective means of achieving our goal. It
                    seemed to me that US tactics would only result in Park Chung Hee becoming more
                    hard-nosed. His position that Korea needed a tough dictatorship to maintain a
                    united front against the North was probably accepted by most Koreans
                    particularly when it was combined with a highly centralized economic strategy
                    which was producing an “economic miracle”. My view was that while I was deeply
                    sympathetic with the human rights movement in Korea—which I insisted had a right
                    to be heard and which was one of the reasons that I insisted that I be seen with
                    some of the opposition—public flogging of the government's record on human
                    rights would only increase repression and tensions. I have always felt that the
                    best approach was to let democracy evolve. The middle class was clearly growing
                    and the economic growth of South Korea almost guaranteed an ever increasing
                    middle class. Much of that middle class was well educated and its members were
                    no fools; they knew what they were doing and I was certain they eventually would
                    claim a seat or seats at the policy making table. I felt democracy in Korea
                    should be permitted to evolve at the pace that this middle class itself set; we
                    should not—and perhaps even could not—accelerate that drive to democracy. Even
                    if we were able to step up the time table, I thought that democracy might come
                    too early—prematurely perhaps—which might set it back to a much more distant
                    future than a natural evolution might. I have been gratified to be a witness to
                    the playing out of the scenario just as I had hoped; in fact, democracy came to
                    Korea in a bloodless and peaceful fashion, almost unperceptable until it had
                    reached fruition.</p>
                <p>While Political Counselor, I had to make demarches to the Foreign Ministry on
                    some human rights issue or another under instructions from Washington. Some
                    time, I would make lower level protest and the Ambassador or the DCM would make
                    them at a higher level. I felt that most of the time, out protestations would
                    fall on deaf ears and that our approaches were pro forma, although on several
                    occasions we were seeking a favorable outcome on a specific violation—e.g. the
                    imprisonment of a Korean dissident. In many such cases, after a while, the
                    Koreans did release the individual in question. I didn't recognize it full at
                    the time, but the Director of North American Affairs in the Foreign Ministry was
                    a deeply religious man; I think he was probably more sympathetic to our
                    approaches than many of his superiors. So I suspect that he was helpful to us in
                    many of these individual cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I should note that one of the problems we faced in Korea was that we were
                    perceived by many as the “big brother” with all the obligations that such a
                    relationship carried, particularly in a Confucian society. The Koreans were
                    willing to show obeisance to their “big brother”, but they expected that we show
                    some understanding of our role in such a relationship. It was the obligations
                    that the Koreans would mention most often. This perception often struck us as
                    unwarranted.</p>
                <p>This relationship is not one that we sought; it was one that the Koreans
                    themselves either wished for or perceived. It was the way the Koreans operated;
                    it was part of the Korean Confucian heritage which placed relationships in a
                    familial context. We did not think in those terms. Secondly, the Koreans would
                    always hold us accountable for having “deserted” them in 1905 and many times
                    afterwards. They would try to place that guilt on the West; after a while, it
                    got to be “old hat” and we came to ignore these views in a sense. I was always
                    mindful and respectful of Korean views, but every once in a while, especially if
                    I had been relaxed by some drinks, I would tell my Korean friends what I really
                    thought of their attitudes toward us. No American knew where Korea was in 1905;
                    it would be highly improbable that we then knew anything about the Japanese
                    occupation or that we really cared. But even my temporary outbursts would not
                    deter the Koreans from their long established cultural views of the world; they
                    just continued to try to play on our guilt. In the Foreign Ministry and in the
                    Ministry of Defense, however, those cultural perceptions never interfered with
                    us conducting business in a work-man like fashion; the officials were
                    professional and had a good sense of reality.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>During the 1973-77 period, I think there was always a strong feeling in Korea
                    that we and they were allies in maintaining stability on the peninsula. I
                    learned that catechism from Phil Habib; it seemed to me that, unlike the human
                    rights issue, there should never have been any evolution of our stated purpose
                    to defend the Republic of Korea. That was our first, second and third objective;
                    we should always be the South's ally and should never allow ourselves to be
                    sucked into a brokered deal, like Vietnam. I felt then, as I did in my second
                    tour, that we should never make concessions to the North Koreans; it would have
                    been a foolhardy venture. I believed that we should stand firmly with the South
                    and not fall for the efforts of the North and others to separate us. (While I
                    think that posture was appropriate in the mid to late 1970s; that posture may
                    not be as applicable today.) The South Koreans were always nervous about a
                    US-North Korea bilateral negotiation; they were almost paranoid about that
                    possibility and always reminded us how unhappy they would be in such an
                    eventuality. Sometime these concerns arose in the context of the truce talks at
                    Panmunjom; any concessions made there seemed to the South Koreans to be alien to
                    their culture which demanded that there be an “eye for an eye”; e.g., if the
                    North had its flag a little higher on the negotiating table, then the South
                    would have to increase the height of its flag to be taller. We viewed these
                    extreme positions to be somewhat nonsensical, but they were deeply ingrained in
                    Korean culture. I think that Americans, being more pragmatic, would from time to
                    time tend to make small concessions on DMZ issues, although I think all
                    concessions were minuscule—more form than substance. But whenever we make these
                    tiny concessions, the South Koreans were noticeably nervous; in fact, they were
                    downright outspoken about their fears that we would walk away from them—as “you
                    did in 1905.” I would always tell my Korean friends that we had never heard of
                    1905; I am not sure that made them feel any better because they genuinely feared
                    that we would somehow leave them in the lurch or at least deal with the North
                    behind their backs.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>That is not to say that the South Koreans did not have reason for concern. In
                    their eyes, the future of a free South Korea depended on steadfast support from
                    the US which could not be mistaken by the North. A tight relationship between
                    the US and the ROK—which left no room for even the smallest opening—was central
                    to their survival. The North was viewed as the real enemy and concern. I always
                    thought that the South Koreans probably understood their “brothers” in the North
                    better than anyone else; after all, they were kinfolk. I think if the
                    North-South shoes had been reversed, the South would have taken the same
                    strategy as the North tried—i.e. to wean us away from the ROK—”splittist
                    tactics”, is the term that was often used. The two were mirror images of each
                    other. I have never thought that there was much difference between a North and a
                    South Korean, if you look under the skin of the North's communism. They were all
                    from the same cultural framework and besides the nature of their regimes, they
                    were very much alike—all “nationalists” to the core. We had another triangular
                    relationship apart from the US, South and North Korea one and that was the
                    US-Japan-ROK relationship. The latter triangle had two very good aspects and one
                    less desirable—tension filled dimension. The positive aspects were the US
                    relationship with Japan and the US relationship with South Korea. These were
                    solid as they had been for many decades, despite the occasional frictions and
                    the cultural gaps that had to be filled all the time. It was recognized then as
                    it is today that the US-Japan relationship was the most important link we had in
                    the Pacific area. The Korea relationship, although not as multi-faceted and as
                    extensive as the US-Japan one, was also critical because of the tenuous peace
                    that ruled the peninsula.</p>
                <p>The relationship between Japan and South Korea on the other hand was not good.
                    The two countries maintained working relations. They had many similarities in
                    their administration and organization and legal framework the Korean TV programs
                    were copied from Japanese models. But basically, Japanese and Koreans are
                    entirely different people and in the 1970s they appeared to hate each other.
                    There was a great deal of understanding between the two countries. But no love.
                    That put us in the middle, trying as best we could, to force the two to improve
                    their relationship so that we could operate more effectively. We needed the
                    cooperation of the two not only with us but with each other.</p>
                <p>The tensions really built up when Madame Park was assassinated. We had to work
                    hard to minimize the friction; Dick Ericson worked very hard and diligently to
                    calm the waters as best he could. There were times during the 1973-77 period
                    when we had to work as intermediaries, as Dick Ericson undoubtedly describes in
                    his own oral history. Even when I became Political Counselor and after Dick's
                    departure, there were occasions when we would have to intercede with the Korean
                    government to calm waters or lobby for some Japanese policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>We had constant contact with Japanese diplomats in Seoul. We consciously
                    developed a policy that permitted us—in fact encouraged us—to discuss the Korean
                    domestic scene with the Japanese representatives to make sure that we were all
                    on the same wave length. We traded information with the Japanese which was
                    useful to us as well because they had insights that we did not have. Most of
                    this work was done by me with my counterpart in the Japanese Embassy; I used to
                    have lunch with him regularly. Later, in the 1980s, those lunches were held at
                    the Ambassadorial level, but in the 1973-77 period, I used to see the Japanese
                    Political Counselor about once a month. I also found those sessions rewarding
                    and interesting for the Japanese had different perspectives than we had. Most
                    conversations dealt with political issues including human rights, but
                    occasionally we would discuss security matters. I think our discussions were
                    generally free and wide open. On a couple of occasions, I went to Tokyo to talk
                    to our people there as well as the Japanese Foreign Office; it was mostly a
                    matter of comparing notes and making sure that the American Embassy in Tokyo was
                    up to date. I believed that it was important for the stability of Northeast Asia
                    that the US and Japan cooperate as much as possible in Korean issues and that we
                    sing from the same sheet of music, even though the Japanese did not have as much
                    influence in Seoul as we did. We knew a lot more about what was going on in
                    Korea, at least in certain areas, particularly the security related ones. So we
                    kept them reasonable well informed without stepping over the line of propriety
                    on military matters.</p>
                <p>Let me now refer to some specific events that occurred in the 1973-77 period. The
                    first that comes to mind was the Kim Dae Jung kidnaping from Tokyo by the KCIA.
                    I had been in Seoul for a little over a month and was the politico-military
                    officer. So I was not directly involved, but I was certainly interested in the
                    incident. It became clear soon to Habib and others that the KCIA was the
                    master-mind behind the kidnaping. Phil has been credited by those who should
                    know with responsibility for saving Kim's life. He intervened personally in his
                    usual forceful way and pointed out the damage that any retribution on Kim would
                    do to US-ROK relations. I recall that later I talked to Kim Dae Jung about his
                    experiences of August 1973 and the aftermath. He attributed his salvation to
                    divine intervention which seemed somewhat mystical to me. But he believed in it,
                    along with Habib's intervention; he always felt very much in debt to the
                    Ambassador and Americans in general for the rescue. As I have mentioned, when I
                    became Political Counselor, I met with Kim several times and befriended him.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Then there was Madame Park's assassination in August 1974. I was still the
                    politico-military officer; Habib was leaving, as was Dan O'Donahue. But I
                    remember that incident very clearly because it happened right in the middle of
                    Seoul in a ceremonial hall. Habib witnessed the whole incident and gave us a
                    detailed report when he returned to the Embassy. What impressed me the most was
                    the newsreels taken which covered every aspect of the incident. You could
                    clearly see a person running toward the stage and when shots began to ring out,
                    everyone on the stage dove for cover except Madame Park, who kept sitting
                    straight in her chair and was therefore an easy target, and Park Chung Kyu, the
                    head of the Presidential Protective Force, who came forward from behind Park
                    Chung Hee and fired into the audience, thereby killing an innocent witness—a
                    teen age school girl, I think. It may have been a brave act, but a rash one
                    which resulted in the death of an innocent bystander. The assassin—a Korean who
                    lived in Japan—was immediately apprehended; he presumably had been employed by
                    the North to kill Park Chung Hee.</p>
                <p>Of course, when these facts became known, there were massive demonstration in
                    front of the Japanese Chancery which happened to be close to ours. So we got a
                    lot of pepper fog. One of the secretaries in the Political Section became
                    furious with me because she was convinced that I had opened my window better to
                    see what was going on; in fact I had kept them shut tightly, but even so the
                    pepper fog seeped through and we had to deal with it. The crowds were not only
                    large but also irate; they couldn't get to the Chancery very well because its
                    entrance was on a small alley—it had been built that way on purpose just for
                    such occasions. But one day, I was told that one person in the crowd cut off his
                    finger and threw it into the Chancery courtyard. That tells you a little about
                    the level of anger. We were not the target at any time of the mob's anger, which
                    I welcomed with some relief.</p>
                <p>Student demonstrations were another visible sign of Korean discontent. As the
                    politico-military officer, I was not directly involved, but I did discuss the
                    possible ramification of those demonstrations with our military command. I was
                    particularly interested in the issue of “operational control”; and the right of
                    the CINCUNC, the American four star general to bar the use of Korean troops
                    under his command from taking certain actions in a peace time situation. As I
                    recall, almost all Korean forces were under the UN command, although there may
                    have been some disparate units that were directly and solely under the command
                    of the Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff. I believe that the documented rules
                    specifically stated that the UN command would have to relinquish control over
                    Korean forces. The written ground rules were quite specific about “operational
                    control”—its applicability, its enforcement and the means to be used to
                    relinquish it for certain or all Korean forces. I don't remember us ever
                    relinquishing “operational control”; I believe that whenever in the post WW II
                    period the Korean troops operated under their own command—if they had been
                    assigned to the UN command—they did so unilaterally without CINCUNC
                    blessing.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>The precedent for dealing with students was taken in 1960-61 when the series of
                    major demonstrations took place. The Korean military forces at that time
                    essentially detached themselves from “operational control”—unilaterally, as I
                    recall being told. Those military detachments then were sent to confront the
                    students in an effort to minimize violence—which was often generated by military
                    actions in the first place. The question of peace time “operational control” had
                    then and for decades thereafter become a major issue which at times was always
                    contentious even though on paper there seemed to be some firm guidelines. I
                    recall that I was told that in the 1960 period we were very disturbed by the
                    Korean unilateral action. Korean military units just decided that at least for
                    the period of the student unrest, they would not be under the control of the
                    UNCINC and operated under the instructions of their own military commanders. The
                    Korean military behavior in 1960 left considerable residual concern among the US
                    military because we did not want to be held responsible for acts we could not
                    control. In the mid-1980s, the US military was concerned about the possibility
                    of a repeat unilateral withdrawal of Korean troops from the UN command. After
                    reviewing the issue, we generally concluded that there was very little a CINCUNC
                    could do if the Koreans wanted to abandon “operational control” beyond
                    jawboning. It was clear that Park Chung Hee, if he thought that his regime was
                    in danger, would withdraw the troops from the UN command and use them to subdue
                    any civilian unrest. We also came to the conclusion that the precedent of 1960
                    established clearly that the Korean troops might shoot at students once, if they
                    had to, but never twice. If ordered to shoot a second time, those troops were
                    very likely to mutiny. So the use of Korean troops in a situation of domestic
                    uprising was limited because they were not reliable “keepers of the peace”—they
                    were not likely to kill their countrymen, after perhaps a first warning volley.
                    Those were the two conclusions I recall that the US command reached at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Let me just briefly mention Tongsun Park and “Koreagate”. The apex of that story
                    really took place after I left Korea, but being in Washington, I followed those
                    events closely. I knew Tongsun Park personally; I had met him several times and
                    we attended some social events at the Georgetown Club that he started and owned.
                    I knew his brother, Ken Park, very well; I played golf with him often. Ken
                    unfortunately committed suicide later. He was extremely wealthy. Tongsun was a
                    real “smoothie”—a con man who had to be watched carefully; he was not trusted by
                    the American community in Seoul. I think everyone suspected Tongsun Park of some
                    kind of nefarious activities; he was just too slick. I wasn't responsible for
                    Washington participation in the Justice Department investigation; that action
                    rested with the Korea desk and Bob Rich—its chief.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Now let me turn to August 1976 and the murder of two American officers in the
                    DMZ. As soon as I heard about it, I headed for Yongsan to the command post. As I
                    mentioned earlier, this came as second nature to me; any problem in the DMZ
                    would sent me racing to the command center. I set up a post, so to speak, in
                    Stilwell's outer office. I was concerned from the beginning that Stilwell was
                    taking a very hard line and preparing a retaliatory strike. In a way I did not
                    blame him. I well remember that photographs of the murdered officers came to the
                    office; they were horrendous because these guys had been beaten to death. I had
                    never seen such brutality in my life. It was a very tense situation. I
                    immediately phoned Washington—Phil Mayhew, the deputy director of the office of
                    Korean Affairs. I also called Tom Stern, the Charg� to bring him up to date. But
                    Stilwell's view was of increasing concern to me. I felt that this was the kind
                    of situation that cried for civilian control in Seoul and Washington. I don't
                    remember Stilwell ever issuing orders for retaliatory action, but he was
                    certainly planning for something—and rather quickly. My continual reporting by
                    phone was welcomed in Washington where obviously many people were seeking
                    information.</p>
                <p>At one point, Stilwell became quite angry because he found out that I was
                    reporting events in real time. I explained to him that I was on the phone with
                    my colleague in the Department in Washington; he really could not object to
                    that. I do not remember in any detail what Stilwell's plans were, but it became
                    later clear that he was moving further and faster than Washington wished. I
                    think it was clear to Washington that Stilwell was moving ahead of the policy
                    planners. To the best of my recollection, Stilwell was preparing to have troops
                    move north toward the DMZ, ready to take action. I was most concerned about
                    Stilwell's mindset more than his actions. From the beginning, I agreed that the
                    North had obviously exceeded acceptable limits, but the US military's posture
                    seemed one of revenge. I had serious doubts about that approach in an already
                    abnormally tense situation. Subsequently, a couple of weeks later, Sneider
                    returned from vacation and then there was some “strong” dialogue between the
                    Ambassador and the CINC.</p>
                <p>I certainly had no objections to the Command's wish, expressed almost from the
                    beginning, to restart the tree cutting effort. It was clear to me that we had to
                    enforce our rights in the DMZ and that meant going back to the tree and cutting
                    the limbs that were obstructing our view. That was a perfectly legal activity
                    and I think it was right and proper that we follow up on it and finish the
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I think people have to understand that in this instance the first 24-48 hours
                    were primarily devoted to fact gathering. The first information received was
                    certainly fragmented and it took the Command some time to nail down the sequence
                    of events. But I remained at the command post off and on for several days,
                    monitoring and reporting the information that was being collected and the plans
                    of the military. I was certainly in accord with the Command on finishing the
                    tree trimming exercise, but I was very reluctant to see us go beyond that,
                    unless further provoked by North Korean troops. The Command was right in being
                    prepared to take further action if provoked, but I did not think it appropriate
                    for us to do anything more initially then to finish the tree trimming task.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I have some recollection of Stilwell being quite frustrated by the short-leash
                    that Washington had placed on him. In fact, the Command was on the phone
                    continually to JCS, which dictated every troop movement. I think that tight
                    control stemmed from Washington's early awareness of the tense situation that
                    had developed on the Korean Peninsula. I think Washington was also very aware of
                    the risks involved in any precipitous action and the need to move in a
                    deliberate and thoughtful way. I mentioned that when Sneider returned from
                    vacation (he was ordered back by Phil Habib), there was a confrontation between
                    him and Stilwell. Dick Sneider was highly agitated and very determined from the
                    minute he landed in Seoul that he would now take charge of the US policy and
                    operations in Korea. This attitude was consistent with Dick's general view of
                    his role in Seoul to begin with; furthermore, I don't think he was too happy to
                    have his precious summer vacation disrupted. I remember quite clearly the first
                    meeting that Sneider and Stilwell held after Dick's return from Washington. It
                    took place in the CINC's bunker. There were, I believe, at least 25 people in
                    the room, including a number of Korean generals. The Korean military were
                    sitting along one side of a rectangular table; Sneider sat directly on the
                    opposite side. Stilwell occupied one other side and his staff sat opposite him.
                    Stilwell began with a briefing; he then went on to talk about his views. At that
                    point Sneider exploded; he was “loaded for bear”. He obviously intended to take
                    control of the situation and to make it clear to everyone that he was in charge
                    of all US operation in Korea. As I said, he erupted in anger and then Stilwell
                    responded in kind. At that point, a colonel—whom I considered to be one of the
                    smartest US officers I had ever met—who was standing behind Stilwell in the
                    doorway, intervened. He suggested that the meeting be adjourned and that Sneider
                    and Stilwell continue their confrontation privately in an adjoining room. That
                    took the principals aback; but they agreed and went into the separate room. I
                    considered the colonel's intervention not only appropriate, but also courageous
                    since he publicly reminded the two principals that their public behavior was not
                    really appropriate. So Sneider and Stilwell—alone—retired to the back room; I
                    suspect that Sneider continued to emphasize his predominance; Stilwell had no
                    choice except to acquiesce; he had to acknowledge that the Ambassador was the
                    personal representative of the President and therefore the top dog in the
                    country. I think that session put issues back on the track and after that, we
                    didn't have any more reservations about the CINC and his views. I can well
                    remember the faces of the Korean officers to whom civilian control of the
                    military was a foreign concept; in Korea in those days, the roles were reversed.
                    So they were surprised and amazed by the exchange between the Ambassador and the
                    CINC. I have no doubt that Park Chung Hee had a full report of what had
                    transcribed within minutes of the meeting breaking up. I don't think anyone
                    could have left the Command that day with any doubts on the role of a civilian
                    ambassador even in a semi-military situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I could not know who had actually ordered the attack on the American military
                    contingent that was sent to trim the tree. The question of whether it was just a
                    sergeant or whether it came from higher up is still unknown today, but I had no
                    doubt that the attack was planned before the event ever took place. The North
                    Korean troops had been brought to the site in a truck, who at someone's command
                    jumped out and set upon the American contingent with axe handles. It was
                    obviously a calculated move which had not been decided on the spur of the
                    moment; in any case, the North Korean action was a serious breach of the
                    Armistice Agreement. The provision of that Agreement clearly gave us the
                    authority to trim or remove any obstruction of our view of all areas within
                    Panmunjom, (the Peace Village). The tree had grown and spread so that our
                    observers could not view the “Bridge of No-Return” and the guard boxes that were
                    placed at the bridge. Our military had notified the North Koreans ahead of time
                    of our intentions and the reasons for our action. There may have been some
                    objections from the North—I believe that the tree all of a sudden became “holy”
                    and therefore untouchable, but we were well within our legal rights to trim the
                    tree.</p>
                <p>So it was not surprising that our contingent was taken by surprise by these North
                    Korean troops—at least a dozen of them. It was an illegal and brutal act by the
                    North Koreans—fully captured on film by the way—which resulted in the death of
                    two American officers who were beaten with ax handles. I have no doubt that it
                    was planned and prepared by the North Koreans. But I don't believe that any of
                    us had any solid information to estimate who had given the orders. I think, even
                    today, that the order probably came from fairly senior levels. North Korean
                    sergeants do not take actions of this nature on their own. It was an incident
                    that drew world attention and concern and I think it must have been authorized
                    fairly high in the chain of command.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The whole incident was concluded essentially by us finishing the tree trimming.
                    Tensions cooled after we had taken action, although we were prepared for the
                    worst when our troops went back in with their shears and saws. Of course, the
                    word “cooled” has to be seen in the DMZ context where tensions always ran high.
                    For example, the DMZ is a border which the North tried to bypass by digging
                    tunnels under it. That would have been an unusual effort in any part of the
                    world, but in Korea it was particularly egregious. I was there when the first
                    tunnel was found. That discovery came about when someone observed plumes of hot
                    air rising from the ground; that air had seeped through the layer of earth above
                    the tunnel where it was warmer. In fact a small cloud went straight across the
                    DMZ; that suggested that something unnatural was taking place, and led the
                    UNCINC troops to the tunnel that was being dug under the DMZ. Presumably the
                    North hoped to use them to infiltrate their troops unnoticed in the South. The
                    first one, I believe came out just south of the DMZ; the ones found later exited
                    a considerable distance behind the DMZ. This discovery raised immediate interest
                    and concern, not only about the one found but about other tunnels which may
                    still have been undiscovered. Through the use of listening devices and other
                    means, we soon found other tunnels in various stages of completion. The finding
                    of these new tunnels was the result of very intensive detection efforts. We did
                    learn that finding a small tunnel was very much like looking for a needle in a
                    haystack. We did find some, but no one can really be sure that all have been
                    found, even today.</p>
                <p>I can remember Stilwell having a long discussion with some Italian archeologist
                    who had spent his lifetime looking for catacombs in Rome. I reported that
                    conversation with some amusement. I think Stilwell was deeply interested because
                    the archeologist brought some expertise to the challenge of finding tunnels. As
                    it turned out, finding catacombs in Rome was not entirely applicable to tunnels
                    under the DMZ. The catacombs were huge when compared to the narrow tunnels that
                    the North was digging. The existence of tunnels remained a US concern, although
                    by the time I returned to Korea in the early 1980s, I think everyone had
                    accepted the existence of the tunnels and the continued search for these tunnels
                    was no longer the head-line news that the first or even the first few had
                    become. The discovery of tunnels became a big business. Some outfit had been
                    established which spent its full time on searching and finding tunnels. It was
                    the typical military approach; if there is a problem, you just set aside some
                    resources to try to rectify the situation. I visited the tunnel-searchers one
                    time with our Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I never went into a tunnel. That would have been a violation of the Armistice
                    Agreement. Nevertheless, the military developed a whole program of visitations
                    to the tunnels. It was partly a tourist attraction, but I think it was used
                    primarily as a propaganda device to bring to the attention of the visitors the
                    nefarious ways of the North; the briefings emphasized the perfidy of our
                    “adversary”. Both Ed Hurwitz and I objected to the military's approach to this
                    issue, but we were ignored. It was our view that civilians in the DMZ were a
                    violation of the Armistice Agreement and that we should stick to the letter of
                    the law. It is true that the North was violating that Agreement, but that was no
                    excuse for us to do the same thing. But the desires of the Command prevailed, in
                    part because Sneider was really not concerned about what the military was doing.
                    We did I think manage to convince our Embassy colleagues not to visit the
                    tunnels, even though I am sure the Command would have been glad to bring us to
                    the tunnels. But as far as I know, no one in the Embassy at that time violated
                    the Agreement by visiting the tunnels. I still think that bringing civilians to
                    the tunnels was inappropriate, particularly when these visits were used for
                    propaganda purposes. Later, these tunnels became major tourist attractions, the
                    ROK developed the sites into regular stops for tours.</p>
                <p>We did take VIPs to the DMZ so that they could get a feel for the situation. When
                    General Hollingsworth commanded I Corps, those tours which included his personal
                    briefings were spectacular. We would take the visitor to the DMZ and move from
                    outlook to outlook by helicopter, escorted by Holly. I will never forget
                    standing on one outlook, on top of a mountain peak, overlooking the Chorwon
                    Valley—which was the route that we anticipated the North would use if it ever
                    decided on an invasion of the South. Holly pointed to the valley and said in his
                    booming, gruff voice,: “That, gentlemen, is where we will murder the
                    bastards!!!”. He did that with such relish and enthusiasm that all his audience
                    would also get excited and were themselves ready to plunge into the valley to
                    defend the South. It was a great show! Holly was a very skilled briefer; he
                    could convince even the most ardent opponents of our presence in Korea that he
                    and his men were the only thing that stood between freedom and a return to the
                    Dark Ages. There were very few skeptics left after Holly's briefings. I must
                    admit that when Hollingsworth first arrived to take over his command, I was
                    concerned because I was afraid that he would be too aggressive. He had made his
                    reputation in Vietnam where he had dropped more ammunition on the town of An
                    Loch than had been used since the WW II bombing of Berlin. He was indeed proud
                    of his achievements. In fact that was his approach to battle—overwhelm the enemy
                    with a raging storm of ammunition. In fact, when he became the I Corps
                    commander, he revised the battle plans to reflect his view of how the war was to
                    be conducted. Stilwell approved those plans which were a sharp departure from
                    the past because they called for a “forward defense”—i.e. meeting the enemy with
                    overwhelming force at the point of his attack into the South. The Koreans warmly
                    endorsed the concept because it provided at least some hope of reducing the
                    damage to Seoul. The old plans—based on a “defense in depth” strategy—in fact
                    would have meant Seoul's destruction. Holly wanted to drive the North back
                    before it could reach Seoul and rain severe damage on the city. Seoul was the
                    heart of South Korea; so a strong defense of it was certainly most welcomed.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I took visitors to the DMZ even when I was the DCM, later in the '80s. The
                    substance of the briefings was roughly the same. The major difference was in the
                    truce village itself. When I first served in Korea, the entire area was open to
                    all who were in the Panmunjom area—both North Koreans and Americans. That
                    situation changed as result of the tree trimming incident. A line was negotiated
                    which separated the village into two sections: one reserved for the North and
                    one for us. Neither side was then permitted to cross that line. I think the
                    drawing of the line and the separation of forces made a deep impression on every
                    visitor. It was a visible sign of tensions, which could erupt without warning.
                    The potential for confrontation which could spread quickly was certainly
                    palpable. That of course was one of the reasons we used to take visitors to
                    Panmunjom; it was to impart to them the concern that we felt about the dicey
                    situation in Korea. It was not done for propaganda purposes, but we did want to
                    ensure that the Washington visitors—whether from the Executive or Legislative
                    Branches—could experience first hand the tensions as we saw them. The North
                    Korean observers would sit in their tower and take pictures of all visitors.
                    Both sides would use binoculars to watch each other; every one peered at each
                    other.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the village there were some huts. One was used by the Armistice
                    Commission for its meetings. On each side of the conference table, stood a flag.
                    I think I mentioned before that those flags were the subject of a competition to
                    see which would be taller. It was a silly kind of competition, but a visible
                    indicator of the animosity that existed between North and South. There was a lot
                    of those small incidents when one side would do something and the other side
                    would try to top it. When that game was played long enough, both sides would
                    eventually accept a new balance. I attended a few Armistice meetings; the North
                    was on one side with a Chinese observer sitting at the end of their side of the
                    table. The US was represented by an Admiral, sitting opposite the North side,
                    with his staff arrayed along side of him, including some South Korean
                    representatives and interpreters. The meetings were really staged; that is, the
                    texts were prepared ahead of time and neither side veered very far off its
                    usually narrow instructions. The North was always very strident and
                    uncompromising, giving it a bad image that we used to portray in our
                    briefings.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I should make some comments about my recollections of the South's missile
                    program. Some missiles and rockets were developed by the South, without our
                    assistance. It was a program that was of some concern to us. We did bring LANCE
                    missiles into South Korea; that missile was a dual purpose weapon—i.e. it could
                    be used with a regular warhead or a nuclear one. Our missile was a proven weapon
                    system; the South Korean ones were all experimental. I am not sure that they
                    ever developed a working model which was just as well because we felt sure that
                    the South was also developing a capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Had it been
                    able to develop both a missile and a nuclear weapon, that would have changed the
                    situation on the Peninsula; therefore we were greatly concerned about both
                    development programs. I remember discussing with General O.D. Street, the
                    JUSMAAG chief, the desirability of providing short range missiles to the South
                    Koreans. Those missiles would not have been able to reach Pyongyang and would
                    therefore have been less destabilizing than the ones that the South Koreans were
                    trying to develop themselves. There was some hope that if we provided the short
                    range ones that might stop the Korean development effort for longer range ones.
                    I should make it clear that the South Korean missile and nuclear capability
                    development efforts were surreptitious; all we knew about them we had learned
                    from intelligence sources. As far as I can remember, we never did provide
                    missile assistance to the ROK because it would have involved providing drawings
                    and plans as well as actual systems; that was going too far.</p>
                <p>The nuclear issue arose soon after I became the Political Counselor. The question
                    we faced was how we could get the Koreans to cease and desist in their
                    experimental nuclear development program, which we had learned about through CIA
                    intelligence collection. The ROK was trying to build a nuclear device. I believe
                    that they were working on this program in Duduk, a town they had built for
                    scientific and technical development efforts. To build a nuclear device—or even
                    to develop one—depended on a supply of plutonium—enriched uranium. We suspected
                    that the Koreans intended to get the material from a reprocessing plant which
                    they had ordered from the French. The raw material would come from the waste
                    generated by the nuclear power plants which Westinghouse had and was building.
                    Then that waste would be reprocessed and would as one of its products generate
                    plutonium. We had no doubt about the reliability of the information we had
                    received. The Korean source had been developed by a CIA officer. The recruitment
                    was an extraordinary success.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>There was no doubt in our minds that we had to prevent the South from starting
                    any such nuclear development program. At the same time, we did not want to make
                    this an open confrontation between our countries; we did not want to embarrass
                    the ROK. But the fact that the Koreans had to procure the reprocessing plant
                    from the French gave us an opportunity to derail the development program.
                    Sneider started a series of conversations, starting with the Science Minister
                    and going on to other involved ministries in an effort to stop the procurement.
                    At first, we were met with polite, but non-committal response. The Korean ploy
                    was to question why the US was so interested in what was essentially a domestic
                    issue—a reprocessing plant. I went with Sneider to all of his meetings with the
                    ministers, except the last one, which he held with the Secretary General, who
                    next to Park Chung Hee was the highest ranking official in the Blue House. He
                    told me after that meeting that he had told the SG that US-ROK relations were at
                    stake and a Korean procurement would require a US reassessment of that
                    relationship. If the South Koreans had had any doubt about our concern, that
                    meeting with the SG would have put them to rest. We were greatly concerned and I
                    think we made it very clear to the Koreans. Our conversations also, I think,
                    made it clear that we knew why the Koreans were so anxious to procure this
                    reprocessing plant. Only an issue of the magnitude of a nuclear device
                    development program would have brought such a strong response from the US.
                    Through this process of consultation, we did not openly confront the Koreans;
                    all of our conversations were private and therefore when the Koreans finally
                    decided to cancel their procurement, “face” was not at stake and that made it
                    much easier for them to back away. I learned subsequently that in fact, although
                    the reprocessing plant procurement was canceled, the Koreans did continue a very
                    small and modest nuclear development program, but without a source for the basic
                    ingredient, they could not develop a device.</p>
                <p>I should also mention that following Sneider's negotiations, we entered into a
                    scientific agreement with the Koreans, which was a “fig leaf” that enabled the
                    Koreans to show something for giving up the reprocessing plant. Sneider signed
                    that agreement with the Minister of Science and Technology. I have a picture of
                    that ceremony which has some amusing aspects to it. Everyone in the picture—the
                    Science Minister, the Deputy Foreign Minister, Sneider and I—have the sourest
                    expression that I have ever seen in a group portrait. I think it was just by
                    accident that the cameraman caught us all with our dourest expressions on, but
                    it was reflective of the view of both sides—the Koreans were bitter and we were
                    not very elated ourselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Beyond our general reluctance to accept nuclear proliferation, the discussion was
                    also stimulated by our concern for the ROK taking offensive action against the
                    North. All Koreans after all, regardless whether they lived north or south of
                    the DMZ, were Koreans. They are aggressive people and if there was concern for
                    the North taking offensive action, then it was appropriate for us to be wary of
                    the South's motives and actions as well. As with many oriental cultures, the
                    Koreans were very much concerned about “saving face” and also believed in the
                    “eye for an eye” policy. This always therefore required a prompt response to any
                    actual or perceived injury received from another party. Not to retaliate was
                    seen as an invitation for further action by the adversary because he would view
                    a lack of response as a sign of weakness. It was not that the South Koreans were
                    looking to make war, but their view required a response of at least equal
                    magnitude to any provocation from another party. That attitude and philosophy is
                    bound to cause some concern for a foreign observer, such as the United States
                    even if it was closely allied with South Korea. We were always afraid that in
                    this charge-counter charge atmosphere, developments might spin out of control
                    and we would find ourselves in a battle that we had not sought. Habib used to
                    comment that no one could ever know what went on in the DMZ; it was always a
                    powder keg that could explode at any time. He would sometimes add that it might
                    be just as well that we didn't know all that was going on there; it might
                    prevent any of us from sleeping at all. So the possibility of escalation was
                    never far from our thoughts.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I observed over time that Koreans were almost mercurial in the
                    way they reacted to a situation; they would be quick to return fire with fire.
                    But it was also noticeable that these incidents calmed down as quickly as they
                    arose, particularly the ones that occurred at sea or in the air. Those were
                    incidents we could monitor with our electronic equipment, unlike events on the
                    DMZ which required visual observation. It became clear to me that whenever a
                    confrontation started, it was immediately taken over by a central command, on
                    both sides. Once that control was established—and sometimes we were talking
                    about just minutes—airplanes that were despatched for action, would begin to
                    circle and cease aggressive action. So I felt that at least at the command and
                    control level, good common sense was being exercised with a remarkable—and
                    correct—dose of restraint and reality being exercised—on both sides. These
                    observations further fortified my view that all Koreans, regardless of the
                    regime they lived under, were very similar in their reactions and outlook. It
                    was probably true that the volatility that we were worried about and our anxiety
                    about the actions of Koreans on both sides of the DMZ were probably under better
                    control than we thought. Still, in all, they were all Koreans!</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Before ending the discussion of this part of my career, I would describe one
                    incident because I consider it illustrative of a lot of the issues that we
                    confronted on a daily basis. One late winter evening in February, 1977 (I
                    believe), I heard that a confrontation had taken place at sea. As was my
                    practice, I immediately went to the command post at Yongsan. When I got there I
                    found Admiral Hank Morgan, the head of our DMZ negotiating team and the senior
                    US Naval officer in Korea, sitting in his office looking pensively at the
                    ceiling. He told me a little about the incident, including the fact that there
                    had been a number of deaths. He told me that North Korean fast patrol boats had
                    crossed the so-called “Northern Limit Line” (NLL) at very high speed. That line
                    was an arbitrary extension of the DMZ that had been drawn by someone, both into
                    the China Sea and the Sea of Japan. It was not part of the Armistice Agreement
                    and legally, the North could wander across it into the open seas outside of the
                    12 mile territorial limit as much s they wished. But someone, long before, had
                    drawn this line on a map and by custom it had become a line which we and the
                    South Koreans did not expect the North to cross. And in fact, both sides had
                    respected this line before 1976-77 even though it had no legal status. So when
                    the North Korean patrol boats crossed that line, it became a challenge. Morgan,
                    on his own authority, had ordered a South Korean destroyer out to sea to
                    intercept these patrol boats. He ordered that the North Korean boats be boarded.
                    When he told me that, I instinctively reacted with a question: “But, Hank,
                    aren't these boats on the high seas?”. He agreed that was the fact and then I
                    injudiciously asked whether boarding those boats was not an act of piracy.
                    Morgan flew out of the chair and yelled at me: “Goddamn it, Cleveland, you sound
                    just like a fucking Congressman!”.</p>
                <p>I will never forget those words. Morgan came from the JP Morgan family and had
                    married the daughter of Admiral McCain, Sr., then the CINCPAC and the sister of
                    the current Senator from Arizona. As you can well imagine, the tension was very
                    high. I suggested that in fact, the Admiral just might have to talk to those
                    Congressmen or at least that someone might have to answer to Congress for
                    Morgan's decision. During this discussion with Morgan, I found out that the
                    destroyer had cut a North Korean fishing boat in two and thirty DPRK fisherman
                    had drowned. It was a tragic consequence of a very rash decision which I think
                    was faulty. Later we surmised that the patrol boats had in fact been despatched
                    to round up and bring the fishing boats back above the NLL. It was a purely
                    defensive action by the North in an effort to save their fishermen; it turned
                    out to have tragic consequences stemming from an completely illegal order of
                    piracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>At the end of my conversation with Morgan, I asked him: “Hank, why did you give
                    that order?”. He answered that because if he hadn't, Park Chung Hee would have.
                    My obvious observation was to ask why he didn't let Park take the onus for an
                    illegal act. Morgan's final comment was: “I made an immediate decision to take
                    action to insure that the Command would maintain operational control over the UN
                    forces”. This exchange illustrates clearly the conflicting pressures that all US
                    representatives in Korea faced. There were rare instances when an issue was
                    clear cut; there were always a multitude of factors that had to be weighed. The
                    importance that the Admiral placed on maintaining operational control is
                    instructive because in this particular case, it became the predominant objective
                    regardless of possible consequences, certainly including loss of life. I fully
                    accepted the importance of maintaining operational control, but I was also very
                    aware of the potential risks and dangers that it imposed on us. It was a
                    responsibility that has on several occasions placed the US in very difficult
                    circumstances and I think all commanders had to be aware of the pluses and
                    minuses of having operational control over foreign forces. We thought we had to
                    have Opcon in Korea as long as we were pledged to defend that country, but it
                    was and is a responsibility which has to be handled with utmost care, sensitive
                    to all the nuances, particularly political ones, that come with the authority. I
                    think Morgan's stated thought processes were very interesting; he decided to
                    maintain US operational control at all costs; he was more concerned about the
                    loss of US control than he was of the immediate illegal action that he took. I
                    don't think it was a very good reason to kill thirty innocent people, regardless
                    of their nationality. I don't doubt that Morgan may well have thought that by
                    maintaining operational control in the US command might have prevented an even
                    greater tragedy. But he committed an act of piracy—ordering a South Korean Navy
                    to board North Korean ships in international waters. The second mistake, which
                    was accidental, I am sure, was committed when the destroyer—in heavy winter
                    fog—sliced through the fishing ship. Morgan left Korea soon thereafter and
                    retired from the Navy; I suspect that his action that night may well have had
                    something to do with his early retirement.</p>
                <p>This incident was also a prime example of the importance of civilian control over
                    military actions—certainly during peace time. The action at sea had taken place
                    before any civilian input could be brought to bear and that was most
                    unfortunate; the outcome of Morgan's split second decision might have been far
                    worse than it was. The North Koreans had every legal right to take retaliatory
                    action; what the South Korean destroyer did was sheer piracy and no government
                    in the world would or could have supported Morgan's decision. I accept that
                    there are times when it just isn't possible to bring civilians into the
                    decision-making process; there are undoubtedly times that the military has to
                    react instantaneously for the protection of its own people. But that isn't all
                    that frequently and certainly in the case I have cited, there was plenty of time
                    to seek a civilian viewpoint. Military operational control, as I said earlier,
                    cuts both ways: it is a necessity in the Korean situation, but it is also a
                    weapon that has to be used very, very carefully, fraught with danger and
                    risks.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I should also note that this interception at sea of North Korean patrol boats was
                    another chapter in a long series of events involving the northern limit line and
                    two outposts on the coast of North Korea—Y-Pdo and P-Ydo. These were islands
                    that we had fortified—the one furthest north was heavily fortified. Undoubtedly,
                    the existence of these fortified islands right off their coast were of concern
                    to the North Koreans. Sometime in the mid-1970s, the North began to send its
                    patrol boats south of the limit line, just to test our response which was
                    forthcoming—one way or another. There was some shooting sometimes when these
                    incursions took place, even though, as I said earlier, there was nothing illegal
                    about the North sending these boats as long as they stayed in international
                    waters. Within the 12 mile territorial waters, the South could legitimately
                    claim jurisdiction which it did for the waters around the two fortified islands,
                    which were South Korean territory as specified in the Armistice Agreements.
                    Shooting at North Korean boats sailing in and around the waters of the two
                    islands was a legitimate use of self-defense—at least in our eyes. The North
                    viewed it somewhat differently because it felt—and probably accurately—that
                    these islands were being used for intelligence collection. The situation was
                    further complicated because the northern island's territorial waters overlapped
                    with the North Korea's territorial waters. So the North tested on many occasions
                    our resolve to defend these islands and the waters around them. As I said, the
                    mid to late 1970s was a time when the North tested our resolve on these islands
                    on several occasions. Both Stilwell and Vessey improved the fortifications on
                    the islands. We put Marines and big guns on the islands.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: I had hoped that after my tour in Seoul as Political Counselor, I
                    would be assigned as an Office Director in the Department. I was ready to return
                    to Washington, not having spent very much time at headquarters during my career
                    to that date. Unfortunately, no directorship in EA was available, particularly
                    since Dick Holbrooke had just been appointed as Assistant Secretary and was
                    making major changes in the staffing of the Bureau. He did send me a telegram,
                    asking whether I would be interested in working with him as his assistant for
                    congressional relations. Unfortunately, I did not understand at the time how
                    important Congress was to the Department in general and to Dick Holbrooke in
                    particular. So, I said: no. I later found out that he spent an enormous amount
                    of time and effort on his congressional relations; had I understood that, I
                    think I might have been happy to accept his offer because it was obviously a key
                    job in Dick's mind. I believe that Dick was somewhat unique in his approach to
                    congressional relations. All assistant secretaries had one person in his or her
                    bureau that focused on congressional relations, but those people normally worked
                    through the Office of Congressional Relations (H). Dick on the other hand wanted
                    someone who would represent him directly on the Hill; someone who was right in
                    his office who could take care of any congressional issues that arose on the Far
                    East area.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Not knowing Dick's approach to congressional relations, I felt that the job that
                    was offered was not really a progression in my career; I had hoped for something
                    that I thought sounded better. In any case, I went back and forth with the
                    Bureau and returned to Washington in fact unassigned and then, thanks in part to
                    the intervention of Bill Gleysteen, who was Dick's senior deputy, I was finally
                    assigned to the Inspector General's Office. This was a new operation under Clay
                    McManaway established to inspect our assistance programs around the world. In
                    fact, this program never got off the ground because Senator Hollings stopped it;
                    he did not want a separate inspector general for assistance program. I must
                    admit that I did not handle my assignment after Seoul with much adroitness. I
                    managed to upset Holbrooke because he thought that I didn't want to work for
                    him; I then took a job that never got started.</p>
                <p>After several months, when it became clear that the McManaway operation was not
                    going to be viable, I drifted back to EA without an assignment. They kindly gave
                    me an office and asked me to write a paper on Korea, which was essentially
                    make-work. Eventually, Holbrooke called me and told me that I was going to be
                    the Deputy Director of the Office of Regional Affairs in EA. I took it, although
                    I was still disappointed. I became involved in the issues that a regional
                    affairs office handles; in EA, one of those was refugees, Vietnamese and
                    Cambodians. Herb Horowitz was the Director, but he stayed only a few months and
                    then I was promoted to his job as Director of Regional Affairs.</p>
                <p>The Bureau in 1978 was headed by Dick Holbrooke. He had four deputy assistant
                    secretaries—three of whom were political. Then there were ten office
                    directors—eight country oriented and two regional ones.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The Regional Affairs Office handled all the “cats and dogs”. EA/RA was entirely
                    different from its counterpart in EUR because in that Bureau, the Regional
                    Affairs Office backstopped our representation in NATO and EC and other regional
                    European institutions. EA was much more bilaterally oriented; it did not really
                    need a large regional affairs office. We handled subjects that cut across
                    country borders—e.g. UN, refugees, labor, human rights, etc. EA had a separate
                    Regional Economic Office, so that we did not get involved in issues falling
                    under that rubric. I think Dick hoped that I would take on the speech writing
                    responsibilities, but I really wasn't up to that—I didn't know him well enough
                    nor did I have enough specific knowledge of all the issues in the Bureau. Mike
                    Eiland, who worked for me, did write a speech for Dick on Vietnam that was very
                    well received. But that is as far as our speech writing efforts went. I served
                    in RA for about 12 months. I mentioned human rights. Starting in 1978, this
                    became a serious issues for the Department with the advent of Pat Derian to the
                    office of Assistant Secretary for Human Rights. We viewed the issue a little
                    more dispassionately than the people in the Human Rights Bureau (HR) wished us
                    to do. We did not see eye-to-eye at all with them. They wanted to condemn all
                    governments and people who in their eyes were violators of their concepts of
                    human rights. To that Bureau, East Asia was a ripe target. I don't think it made
                    sense to publically argue that many of the governments in our region were
                    dictatorial and deprived their citizens of freedoms that we believe in and that
                    these regimes could be brutal at times. Of course, to allege violations of human
                    rights was one thing; to prove them was an entirely different matter. I don't
                    think we really had a firm enough grip on the extent of the human rights
                    violations; there were indications, but no solid proof. We had many allegations
                    from those who wanted to perhaps acquire power and therefore found it in their
                    own interest to make the charges of abuse. But these opposition groups seldomly
                    were able to provide us with concrete proof-such as might stand up in a court of
                    law. So public condemnation was risky.</p>
                <p>In addition, we had some reservations about making our policy one dimensional. We
                    had a lot at stake in places like Korea; this was a situation fraught with
                    political and military peril with the North standing aggressively on the other
                    side of a fragile demarcation line. We thought it unwise to continually berate
                    the South Koreans for their human rights behavior when we had so many other
                    objectives that we wanted to achieve. But there was no question that Korea and
                    many countries in East Asia were ripe for cries of anguish from the Human Rights
                    Bureau. We had many very tense meetings with the HR Bureau people. It was in
                    this period that the administration decided to issue an annual report on human
                    rights conditions for every country in the world. There were many officials in
                    the Department who challenged the wisdom of issuing such reports because in
                    addition to adding to bilateral tensions, it was not at all clear that such
                    reports would be efficacious. Eventually, these reports became a Congressional
                    mandate so that now they have become part of the process. The reports became
                    central to our relations with many countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>So, as I said, we were in constant arguments with HR. I became deeply involved in
                    these, particularly when Korea was the issue because I knew the country. By and
                    large, the office directors dealt with the issues pertaining to their own
                    countries with HR. In most cases, compromises were quickly worked out;
                    eventually we would work out language in all cases, but not until there were a
                    number of very tense meetings with HR staff. The Embassy would send in the first
                    draft of its country report; then the desk would tinker with it as well as HR.
                    HR would invariably harden the language and then the negotiations would start.
                    Sometimes, the issues would have to be forwarded to a Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    or even the Assistant Secretaries. Holbrooke, in most cases, was very sensible
                    about these reports. Sometimes he would make concessions that we might not have
                    made, but he certainly resisted any sharp attacks on East Asian countries or
                    leaders, especially since these were unclassified documents that would end up in
                    the press. He understood that sharp public condemnation of another country or
                    personality was not usually the way to conduct relations or to achieve our
                    goals. I certainly at the time agreed that public censure was ill-advised. I
                    must confess however, that as time has passed, my views have changed to some
                    degree. I now think it more feasible for the US to publicly describe a human
                    right situation as it sees it for all countries around the world without running
                    the risk of a major or severe reverberation. At least, my mind is not set
                    against these reports as it was when they began to be issued.</p>
                <p>Let me mention the refugee problem briefly. The East Asia refugee problem stemmed
                    from Vietnam and the aftermath of that war. We were primarily concerned by the
                    boat refugees from Vietnam, who were becoming a major problem in the area. We
                    wanted to know who the refugees were and how we might assist in taking care of
                    them. The refugees were landing in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the
                    Philippines and Hong Kong. The issue was how to insure their safety. The Asian
                    countries were afraid that the Vietnamese would settle permanently in their
                    countries which could have been a major drain on their scarce resources.
                    Essentially, we struck a deal with these countries—that is we and other
                    developed nations and these developing nations. We agreed that the developed
                    countries—Australia, Europe and the US—would become the permanent havens for
                    these refugees. That greatly eased the fears of the Southeast Asian countries;
                    enough at least so that they would permit the establishment of “temporary”
                    refugee camps in their countries, where the refugees could wait until permanent
                    settlement. Some of the “temporary” camps have become long lasting, but the
                    assurance of the West that they will accept the refugees still stands.</p>
                <p>I think over time the deal that was made was a good one for both the refugees and
                    the Southeast countries. In general, the refugee problem has been handled
                    relatively well, with perhaps the exception of the those that landed in Hong
                    Kong during a later period. I was certainly opposed to forced repatriation; I
                    don't think anyone in the government supported that approach at the time. By
                    1981-82, perhaps our views of why people left Vietnam changed, but in 1978-79,
                    we assumed that these people were all political refugees and we certainly would
                    not have repatriated them. Eventually, I believe that the US took about 1
                    million boat refugees. It was a generous contribution to world stability.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Louise McNutt, who worked for me, had served in the Bureau for many, many years.
                    She was our expert on UN affairs and every year would be kept busy with the
                    General Assembly session which always began with ministerial level talks.
                    Regional Affairs would from time to time also become involved in labor issues,
                    arising either from the treatment of working laborers in their own country or
                    from labor union issues in East Asia.</p>
                <p>ASEAN issues were not handled by RA, but by an Office that Holbrooke had
                    established which dealt with Philippine, Indonesia, Malaysian, Thai, Burmese and
                    Singapore issues. Those were the core ASEAN countries and therefore even those
                    the issues were not bilateral, they were primarily handled by that new Office,
                    headed by Bob Fritz. It was Holbrooke's idea to put relations with all ASEAN
                    countries under one Office to insure some uniformity of US policy toward all of
                    these disparate countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In early 1980, you transferred to another job. How did
                        come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Early one Sunday morning of the winter of 1979-80, I received a call
                    from Holbrooke at home. He wanted to see me immediately in his office. I
                    wondered what I had done to deserve such an honor. As it turned out, he had
                    reached the conclusion that Fritz, as good an officer as he was, was just
                    overburdened and could not give Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, then in Thailand,
                    enough time to suit Mort. So Dick asked me to take over responsibility for Thai
                    affairs; he gave me an office directorship and two assistants plus a secretary.
                    He wanted me to concentrate on taking care of Mort's concerns in Washington.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Mort's prime interest at the time was the porous border
                    between Thailand and Cambodia through which masses of refugees flowed out and
                    rice and equipment flowed in. This major flow of people and assets was caused by
                    Vietnamese attacks on Cambodia. In fact, a major crisis had been created at the
                    border. What I didn't realize at the beginning was that Mort was in the process
                    of taking over responsibility for border issues. In effect he took over the
                    leadership of all the NGOs, the UN and other governmental agencies just by the
                    force of his personality and his exceptional ability. Mort is one of the most
                    forceful, creative and finest officers I have worked with. It was not long after
                    he started his efforts that he was de facto in charge of all border operations.
                    It was educational for me to work in supporting him. He did a remarkable job of
                    making all agencies work together and deliver whatever services each was
                    responsible for. The UNHCR in Bangkok was wringing its hands half of the time
                    because Mort was moving ahead without worrying about bureaucracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Mort's activities kept me on the phone for most of the day. First of all, Mort
                    was always inquiring whether his instructions or requests were being complied
                    with and if not, why not. Or why things were taking longer than he thought
                    necessary. I think we spent roughly $18,000 in long distance calls between
                    Washington and Bangkok in 18 months, which is a sizeable bill any time and real
                    money in the early 1980s. It was a great experience for me. I felt useful—for
                    the first time since leaving Seoul. I also learned a lot about moving
                    bureaucracies. The Regional Affairs directorship was fine, but being the Thai
                    Office Director was continual action. Having good superiors also helped; my
                    first one was Mike Armacost and then John Negroponte. Both were very good to me
                    and rose subsequently to some of the most important jobs in the Foreign Service.
                    John, when he took over, called all his office directors to a meeting to tell us
                    that he had a terrible temper. He predicted that he would on occasions be in our
                    face and there would be terrible scenes. He suggested that we not take it
                    personally and that we not let the experience linger because it was not directed
                    at us as individuals; it was just his temperament. In fact, everything went very
                    smoothly for the eight months I worked for John, he never blew up at me.</p>
                <p>I guess I probably had more slack than most office directors because everyone in
                    Washington knew that I was Mort's representative in town and that whatever I did
                    or asked was on Mort's behalf. That was very helpful because Mort commanded
                    considerable respect in most places. The Pentagon was the most recalcitrant
                    player; Mort had worked there and was well known. He had had some run-ins with
                    the Pentagon bureaucracy, which, like all bureaucracies, have long memories.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I remember one issue in particular. Mort wanted some A-1 tanks to shore up the
                    Thai militarily, which was part of his whole strategy to secure the border. He
                    wanted these tanks to be provided the Thais under the military assistance
                    program. So I started a dialogue with DSAA (Defense Security Assistance Agency),
                    ISA (International Security Affairs) and the Army. The Army claimed that it had
                    no surplus A-1 tanks; they needed all they had. It refused even to consider
                    giving up even one, much less the four or five that Mort wanted. So we had a
                    bureaucratic fight. I kept going back to the Pentagon, pleading our case day in
                    and day out, trying to find some way to satisfy the requirement. One day, we
                    received a telegram from Mort that said on the following day he was going to see
                    Thai Prime Minister Prem. The meeting would start with the usual exchange of
                    pleasantries over a cup of tea. The Prime Minister was bound to ask about the
                    tanks. Mort wanted to know how he should respond to the Prime Minister; should
                    he tell him that the tanks were on their way, or was he to give the PM the
                    standard “crap” that he had been feeding him for months. That line got to the
                    Army; it did not take kindly to the Ambassador's phrasing and I think it
                    stiffened its back for another period of weeks. Eventually, we wore the Army
                    down however, and I finally suggested to Armacost that he call the head of DSAA.
                    That finalized the deal and the tanks were declared surplus and provided to the
                    Thais. Months later, the tanks arrived in Bangkok on a ship; a big ceremony was
                    held with the American Ambassador turning these tanks over to the Thai command.
                    Later that week, I got a message from Mort reporting that the tanks had been
                    unloaded again. When I called him, he told me that the tanks had been unloaded
                    about five times so that the photographers could take pictures every time they
                    were unloaded. Mort managed to have the four tanks all of a sudden turn into
                    twenty by loading and unloading the same four over and over again. The Thai
                    government and military were delighted.</p>
                <p>During my tour as Thai Office Director, I went to Thailand two or three times.
                    But frankly, my job had very little to do with our foreign policy towards
                    Thailand per se. My job was to support Mort as he tried to get a hold of the
                    border problems. I was something akin to Abramowitz' ambassador to Washington.
                    Sometime during these 18 months, I found that there were three awards being
                    granted by private institutions for “outstanding contributions to US foreign
                    policy.” I think they were for $10,000 each. I nominated Mort for each of them;
                    he actually won two of them. That was very gratifying because he really deserved
                    recognition for his work in Thailand. I sent Mort a copy of my nomination. When
                    I talked to him over the phone later, he said that anyone could have won those
                    awards with the kind of write up that I had submitted—he said that he thought
                    that I might have overstated the case to some degree. But I thought it was all
                    true, and I still do.</p>

                <p>CLEVELAND: When the Reagan administration came into office, it appointed Dixie
                    Walker as its Ambassador to Korea. Dixie wanted to have someone in Washington
                    whom he knew; so I was assigned as Director of the Office of Korean Affairs from
                    mid-1981 to early 1982. In fact, Dixie had asked whether I would come back to
                    Seoul to be his DCM. I had known him for a long time going back to my days at
                    Yale where he had been an assistant professor. In 1972, when I was the EA
                    Assistant Secretary's special assistant, I had recruited Dixie to be part of a
                    China experts panel which Marshall Green used on a couple of occasions. So Dixie
                    and I had a long relationship and when he was appointed, he asked me whether I
                    would be interested in joining him. I was delighted, but before all the
                    arrangements could be made, I had to stay in Washington and I served as Director
                    of the Korean desk during that period waiting for my orders to go to Seoul. That
                    worked out very well because it gave me an opportunity to be brought up to date
                    on Korean affairs. It was an unusual situation which worked out well.In fact, I
                    had managed to remain current on the major developments in US-ROK relations
                    after my return in 1977. For example, although I was not involved, I kept track
                    of Koreagate (the Tongsun Park rice scandal) in part because I knew all of the
                    players in that cause c�l�bre. While on the Thai desk, of course, I was busy on
                    too many things to worry very much about Korea so as I say the six months on the
                    desk were very helpful to fill in what I had missed in the intervening
                    period.</p>
                <p>In the period while I served in Washington there were many events—as always—in
                    Korea. Park Chung Hee had been assassinated; a major uprising in Kwangju had
                    been brutally suppressed and Chun Doo Hwan had become President. So the
                    situation in Seoul had changed, but not radically. The government was still
                    authoritarian, although I don't think it was as effective as it had been under
                    Park. Chun may have been a little less ruthless, but the concerns we had about
                    the South's security, its human rights' policies and its economic policies
                    really had not changed. The changes between 1977 and 1982 were nothing compared
                    to the changes that have taken place in the last 7-8 years.</p>
                <p>I learned about Park's assassination early one morning (evening in Seoul). By
                    sheer coincidence, I had lunch that day with a former Korean general, Kim Woo
                    Joo, at the Jockey Club. He was visiting the Korean Embassy in Washington. I
                    told him what had happened—at least I was able to tell him that there had been
                    an assassination because at the time nobody was quite sure what would happen
                    next. The general took it all in; I think it came as a great surprise to him. I
                    could see him thinking about all the possibilities; he finally said: “Chun Doo
                    Hwan, Chun Doo Hwan.” I asked him what he meant; he told me that was who would
                    eventually take over the government, which is exactly what happened. I think it
                    was no surprise that someone from the 11th Class of the Korea Military Academy
                    was Park's successor. We all had followed the careers of seven of the graduates
                    of that class for years. The only question was which of “the seven stars” would
                    be the leader; a few months after Park's assassination, we found out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1981, you went to Seoul as DCM. You have already told
                        us how that assignment came about. Tell us a little about the Embassy at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Dixie Walker was the Ambassador. I have already mentioned my long
                    standing acquaintance with him. David Blakemore was the Political Counselor and
                    Walt Lundy was the Economic Counselor at the beginning of my tour—he was
                    followed by Don McConville. I knew these people—some better than others. For
                    example, Blakemore had been in Seoul during my previous tour. He was a top notch
                    officer—very bright—and he wrote very well. Our Administrative Counselors were
                    old pros—first George Knight who was followed by Gerald Mandersheid. Both were
                    wonderful officers—solid and competent. The Consul General was Ken Keller. He
                    was one of the most interesting persons in Seoul at the time. He turned down two
                    opportunities for promotion that I know of because he knew he was going to
                    retire after his tour in Seoul and didn't therefore want to take up one of the
                    MC slots. He was one of the most brilliant people I have ever known. He had a
                    photographic memory; he could visualize pages and pages of Korean names. That
                    was important at the time because during my tour, we undertook the largest
                    single visa anti-fraud operation ever attempted by the Foreign Service.
                    Fortunately, it was very successful and I want to discuss that in greater depth
                    later on. The Station Chiefs were Bob Kennedy and Jim Delaney. The PAO was
                    Bernie Levin, who was also a very good officer.</p>
                <p>I think in general the Embassy staff in this period was outstanding. Korea has
                    always attracted some of the best of the Foreign Service because it was one of
                    the hot spots in the world where the US had major interests. We had some
                    language officers—e.g. Spence Richardson (now in Seoul refreshing his language
                    skills in preparation for an assignment to Pyongyang), Don Nichols who was a CIA
                    officer. We of course had Korean employees who had been with the Embassy for
                    many years. They may have worked for the KCIA, but I expected that all of our
                    Korean employees did some work for that organization, and we were therefore
                    careful about what was said to them and what access they had.</p>
                <p>I don't remember Dixie ever sitting down with me to give me his ideas of what he
                    wanted from his DCM. I guess I just did whatever I thought would be useful.
                    Dixie was a political appointee—very intelligent and conservative. On that
                    latter trait, that fitted in very well because Korea lent itself to a
                    conservative approach, although at times he was more conservative than the rest
                    of us. I had two advantages: I was a seasoned officer and I had served in Korea
                    before. I focused on the day to day management of the Embassy, filling in
                    whenever I saw gaps. Dixie provided overall management and did a lot of the
                    representational work—public appearances. That left me with a large task which I
                    managed as I saw fit most of the time. I thought Dixie was a great manager—he
                    listened and took advice and gave the staff considerable leeway. I couldn't have
                    asked for a better set-up.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I also spent time covering the waterfront. I had my own contacts in the Korean
                    community and did some of my own reporting. Most often, I passed the drafts to
                    Dixie; he made very few, if any changes. So I kept my hand in the substantive
                    reporting area. The government officials whom I saw on a regular basis were Yi
                    Song Okay—the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs—, Gong Rho Myong—the Assistant
                    Minister for Political Affairs then and now the Foreign Minister—, and Park
                    Gun-Woo—the Director for North American Affairs, currently (1996) the Korean
                    Ambassador to the US. I saw Park most frequently; he was an old friend. The
                    North American Directorate in the Foreign Ministry was by far the largest
                    component of that institution and Park was beginning to expand its function to
                    include Politico-Military affairs. The Foreign Ministry did not have a Pol-Mil
                    Bureau, but Park saw the need and he started to take on the liaison
                    responsibility with the Defense Ministry. I think in part we (the US), were
                    responsible for forcing the Foreign and Defense Ministries to work much more
                    closely because we raised issues that cut across neat jurisdictional lines. Park
                    Gun Woo saw the future; he understood that the Foreign Ministry would have to
                    acquire greater responsibility and therefore greater knowledge as Korea became
                    an increasing force in international relations.</p>
                <p>Outside the Foreign Ministry, I used to have regular contacts with the Trade
                    Ministry—Park Pil Soo, an assistant minister and some of his staff. I had
                    regular contacts with Blue House staff members—Choi Kwang Soo, Kim Kyong Hwan,
                    Lee Bum Suk (he was later killed in the Burma assassination when he was the
                    Foreign Minister). I also saw officials in the Defense Ministry and played golf
                    continually with some Korean generals. Unfortunately, my language competence was
                    minimal; I studied it incessantly, but I could remember my German—learned
                    twenty-five years earlier—far better that Korean; I did learn enough Korean to
                    get along in the Kisaeng house and in the marketplaces and on the golf courses
                    with the caddies. I could probably even maintain some kind of dialogue with an
                    old Korean general who didn't speak much English; between his broken English and
                    my broken Korea, we could maintain some kind of dialogue. But I found Korean a
                    very, very difficult language.</p>
                <p>Dixie maintained contact with the CINC. Unlike my previous experience, he had a
                    good relationship with the CINC and the American military in general. We did not
                    face the tensions that had existed in the mid to late 1970s. There were of
                    course differences in views between the diplomatic and military arms of the US
                    government, but that was to be expected. I think Dixie's relationship with both
                    Bob Sennewald and Bill Livsey—the two CINCs while I was in Seoul—was pretty
                    good.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>That gave me more time to pursue my own interests; Dixie had no problem with that
                    because he knew that I had good contacts from my previous tour. Also, the fact
                    that I played golf was an asset. It enabled me to talk to high level people,
                    like Cabinet ministers, in an informal setting; it would not have been
                    appropriate for me to call on them in their offices, but out on the links, good
                    conversations could be held. The availability of a golf course—in Yongsan—and my
                    interest in playing the game gave me access to many people whom I might not have
                    been able to see, except perhaps the highest level—the President. Dixie and I
                    shared the contacts; he knew many members of the cabinet and the business and
                    academic community and he focused on those, while I cultivated the
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>In addition to this contact/reporting function, I also was the overseer of the
                    day-to-day Embassy operations making sure that we were responsive to the
                    Ambassador's and Washington's wishes. As I suggested earlier, the consular
                    operation became an increasing work load for me, although the details of our
                    efforts were left to Keller.</p>
                <p>In general, I think the Embassy sections worked well together. There was a little
                    friction periodically between a couple of the sections, but that didn't
                    interfere with our tasks or our productivity. I can remember one funny situation
                    involving Walt Lundy and the Agricultural Attach�. Walt was skinny and the son
                    of a peanut farmer. Jim Frechman, the Ag Attach�, was fat and the son of a dairy
                    farmer. He always used to complain about the lack of rain. Lundy on the other
                    hand used to say that his father had always complained about too much rain. So
                    there were differences—particularly about the size of the next rice crop. The
                    continual bickering ceased after I called both of them into the office and told
                    them to cut it out. But that was a very minor situation; on the whole, I think
                    the Embassy worked well as a unity despite the many disparate Washington
                    agencies represented in Seoul.</p>
                <p>Carter and I lived in an old Japanese house which was on Compound 1, right in the
                    middle of town. I used to walk to work; sometimes I walked home for lunch. The
                    security strictures in this period were not particularly onerous; I did not use
                    a personal guard and never felt threatened, even towards the end of the tour
                    when the security issue got a little more attention. We may still have had the
                    monthly practice air raids for a while after I arrived, but I believe they were
                    suspended before I left. The curfew, which was in effect during my last tour,
                    had been abolished- -unfortunately, because it meant later hours in the evening.
                    The curfew was very beneficial to diplomats because you could be certain that
                    almost all social occasions would end by 10:30 or 11:00. In fact, life in Seoul
                    during the 1981-85 period was very relaxed. Of course, we were always busy;
                    there is something about Koreans that makes life always interesting from a
                    professional point of view. If there wasn't a crisis in the morning, you could
                    be sure that there would be one by the time the day ended. The social life was
                    always busy; there were very few nights that Carter and I spent at home alone.
                    Some of the occasions were stag—Kisaeng parties—but most were with Carter. So we
                    were busy, but it was most enjoyable.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The city had changed considerably in the intervening five years. The Lotte Hotel
                    had been built right opposite City Hall. I was stunned on return by the change;
                    new buildings had sprung up all over the city. The buildings were marble
                    faced—not just concrete as had been true in the 1970s. It was the third
                    generation of buildings in Seoul, following funny buildings ten story high and
                    then some high-rise buildings which had little grace. The new buildings were
                    impressive; the Koreans were beginning to use new materials and new
                    architecture. By the mid-1980s, traffic was still manageable because the Korean
                    car manufacturers had not yet developed production lines for domestic cars.
                    Motorcycles and small Hyundais were quite popular, but the major surge of
                    traffic didn't really begin until the late 1980s and the early 1990s. So in the
                    early 1980s, one could still drive through town at a reasonable pace. The
                    pollution was as always atrocious, caused primarily by the “Ondol” heating and
                    the diesel buses. The buses downtown looked like railroad trains—one after
                    another in an endless stream. When I walked to work in the morning—particularly
                    in winter time—I could cut through the pollution with a knife and could feel the
                    impact of that stuff on my lungs.</p>
                <p>During the 1981-85 period, Korea was still under a dictatorship, following a
                    military coup led by Chun Doo Hwan. I don't believe that Chun's background was a
                    disadvantage to us; that is, unlike Park Chung Hee, he did not show preference
                    for discussing issues with the CINC rather than the Ambassador. In any event,
                    Bob Sennewald was a top flight human being, and I didn't notice any competition
                    between the CINC and the Ambassador for Chun's attention. I also didn't notice
                    the Koreans trying to play the two elements of the US government one against the
                    other. Of course, in a situation such as existed in Korea, the US military has
                    an advantage because it maintains close contacts with its Korean counterparts,
                    many of whom were close to the President. I think in general, the US Embassy in
                    Seoul probably has never known enough about the Korean military, but I don't
                    think, at least in the period we are discussing, that had any direct effect on
                    our policy and actions. It was not an issue that I spent much time on.</p>
                <p>We still had a JUSMAAG, run by a succession of major generals. There was always,
                    as had been historically true, some friction about who was in charge of the
                    JUSMAAG. On paper, that unit was part of the Embassy, but the general's
                    efficiency report was written by the CINC. That made for a difficult situation
                    for the JUSMAAG chief; some were more skillful than others in bridging this
                    organizational divide. One of the chiefs—Hugh Quinn, who was there for much of
                    my tour—became a close friend of Dixie's. That helped smooth any ruffled
                    feathers that might have arisen.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>While I was in Korea the second time, we established a consulate in Pusan. For
                    many years, we had had a USIA branch library and offices there, just as we had
                    in Kwangju and Taegu. The Pusan USIA operation was the largest—Pusan being
                    Korea's second largest city. We decided to add a consular officer there because
                    it was such a key center. He became the senior US government representative in
                    Pusan, causing considerable dismay among the USIA staff, including and perhaps
                    particularly among the USIA local employees, who until then had been the masters
                    of the ship. I don't think that USIA felt comfortable working under the
                    supervision of a State Department official; we were well aware of the
                    possibility of that reaction when we reached the decision, but we felt that
                    Pusan needed a Foreign Service official in light of the increasing demand for
                    services, such as consular, commercial and political reporting. Pusan was a city
                    of 3 million people with a view that was different perhaps than Seoul's with
                    which we needed to be more familiar. Major Korean firms—Daewoo, Hyundai,
                    etc—were all headquartered in the Pusan region; that became an increasing matter
                    of interest to us. Had we only had a consular workload, I don't think we would
                    have established a post in Pusan; in fact, the consular section in Seoul had
                    concerns about establishing a consular operation which would have been outside
                    their day-to-day supervision. It was concerned that if Pusan refused to issue to
                    a visa, the applicant would try in Seoul and vice-versa, increasing the need for
                    more policing of applications lest we have even more fraud than we were
                    encountering. In fact, I am not sure we ever did issue visas in Pusan. Also
                    there was a growing American population in Pusan—both military and civilians.
                    They needed to be supported by an American official and that was one more reason
                    for our action. Our one officer therefore offered a US presence, provided US
                    citizen protection services, did some political reporting and assisted in
                    commercial work.</p>
                <p>I maintained contacts with the press, probably because of my own preferences
                    rather than of necessity. The 1981-85 period was relatively quiet and we did not
                    have many situations that raised the interest of the press. The government
                    controlled the Korean press, of course, and was inclined in this period to
                    maintain good relationships with the US. It therefore protected us from the
                    local press to some extent; I don't recall that we ever had a confrontational
                    moment with the Korean press. I thought that it was unfortunate that the Korean
                    press was not permitted to be freer; it gave us a free ride, and I am not sure
                    that was a good thing necessarily. I dealt a lot with the American press; I was
                    quite open with them—most of the time—on a “background” basis. The American
                    press was not major work-load because there was only one resident American
                    newspaper man—from “The Wall Street Journal” in Seoul during this period. The
                    other newspaper were covered by reporters stationed in Tokyo who would visit
                    Seoul from time to time. Sam Jameson, of “The Los Angeles Times” was very well
                    informed about Korean matters having covered Korea for many, many years.</p>
                <p>Human rights in Korea was always a big story with the press. Here is an
                    illustration. When Pat Derian returned to Korea with Kim Dae Jung in 1984 or
                    1985, she was escorted by a mass of newspaper people. We had our hands full. It
                    was quite a story, when this troublesome lady got off the plane with Kim Dae
                    Jung.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Pat Derian was well known because of her service as Assistant Secretary for Human
                    Rights during the Carter Administration. She was a strong liberal, if not a
                    radical. She was well remembered for the fervor with which she pursued human
                    rights violations—actual and alleged. I can remember meetings chaired by Warren
                    Christopher, then the Deputy Secretary and now the Secretary of State, held in
                    the late 1970s when he would have to ask Derian to restrain herself,
                    particularly when she advocated actions that may have seemed justified from her
                    human rights' point of view, but would have caused severe damage to US interests
                    in some foreign country. In any case, Derian and Bob White, a former US
                    Ambassador in Central America—well known for his extreme liberal
                    views—accompanied Kim Dae Jung when he returned from the US after a long period
                    of exile. They felt, I suppose, that their presence would save Kim from
                    immediate arrest or some other provocative action. In fact, the
                    KCIA—stupidly—immediately rushed to the plane and after a brief scuffle, took
                    Kim off in a car, leaving Derian and White standing alone at the bottom of the
                    stairs. There are tapes which record Derian screaming, presumably at some KCIA
                    agents: “Get your filthy hands off me, you—.” Derian and White came to the
                    Embassy and raised hell with Dixie. Then they went to the press. As a counter, I
                    was holding “deep background”—no attribution whatsoever, even to an “Embassy
                    official”—briefings for the press. Clyde Haberman, a very good “New York Times”
                    correspondent somehow managed to get a quote from Dixie which described Derian
                    in something less than flattering terms. That quote ended up in the “New York
                    Times” giving its editorial writer food for a very nasty piece about US
                    ambassadors criticizing Pat Derian. Dixie was the subject of several negative
                    comments in the US press. That was too bad because I felt that both Derian and
                    White came to Seoul to foment trouble and Dixie, with his comment, fell into
                    their trap and gave them an opportunity to create mischief.</p>
                <p>The bottom line: this episode was a twenty-four hour story in Korea; it had no
                    impact on Korea's human rights policy, which was not good. The human right
                    situation in Korea in the early 1980s was not a nice picture, as it had not been
                    for a long time. But Pat Derian did nothing to improve it.</p>
                <p>I might just say a word about our policies towards Korea in the 1982-85 period,
                    primarily as a contrast to the policies that existed during my tour five years
                    earlier. In the first place, as it had always been, our principal objective on
                    the Korean Peninsula was the maintenance of peace and stability. That had been
                    true for decades and still is true today. The US could not afford to run the
                    risk of an invasion from the North; too much investment in the well being of the
                    South Koreans could have gone up in smoke in a very brief moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Our second objective, within the security context, was to pressure the ROK
                    government to take as enlightened a political path as possible. There were two
                    major political fault lines in Korea: first, North vs South and second, the
                    Korean military—or government—vs the South Korean people. We worked as best we
                    could to impress on the military and the government the need to modernize the
                    political process and minimize the human rights violations. We did this by
                    continually talking to the government and sometimes even, on background, giving
                    our views to the press. The Korean government of course always connected the two
                    divisions; that is to say, they used to point out to us the dangers from the
                    North as a way to alleviate the pressure we put on it for opening the domestic
                    political process. The Koreans always maintained that their political
                    restrictions were imposed because of the threat from the North. My personal view
                    was that democracy in South Korea was on its way and that sooner or later,
                    democracy would come to that country. The people were highly educated—thousands
                    and thousands had had their education outside of Korea, most in the US. Those
                    people brought back with them democratic concepts that they had seen work well
                    in other countries. It was obvious to me that the 5,000 or so graduates of the
                    Korean Military Academy could not hold out forever against the tens of thousands
                    of their countrymen who had personally witnessed democracy and an open political
                    process. The military had been very useful to the country because they had
                    technical proficiency which was essential to economic development and
                    organizational skills also required for economic development. But by the early
                    1980s, the civilian population had acquired the same skills—perhaps even more
                    sharply honed than the military's. So the contribution that the military had
                    made to economic development was no longer a necessity for South Korea. So I
                    felt, as I said, that democracy would come to the fore in Korea sooner or later.
                    I must frankly admit that I didn't know whether the advent of democracy in South
                    Korea might be a security risk; the opening of the political process could be a
                    messy process and might invite some kind of adventure from the North. I just
                    didn't know the answer to that question, but it did make the timing of the
                    opening a matter of vital importance.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>The real issue was whether the advent of democracy should be forced. I was
                    opposed to pushing the process ahead of what the Koreans themselves were willing
                    to try. It was up to them to dictate the pace of political development.
                    Democracy is not an easy process; the Koreans themselves had to be satisfied
                    that they were mature enough to handle it. Democracy does not come naturally to
                    Koreans as shown by the way their culture and society worked. But inevitably, as
                    the middle class grew—as it was doing rapidly—it was clear to me that enough
                    people would have the desire and intelligence to wish to be in charge of their
                    lives. I was sure that eventually this middle class would eventually demand
                    greater and greater share of the governmental power. I was confident enough in
                    this judgement that I was willing to let this process develop naturally; that is
                    without overt, outside interference or pressure. I did not believe that it was
                    the US' role to force the pace of the process. I thought that we promoted
                    democracy the best when we stood as an example. This is not to say that we
                    should not have remonstrated about human rights violations; we should have and
                    did, often quite forcefully—I always believed in speaking in strong terms to
                    Koreans because that was the way they communicated with each other. I had no
                    objection to being tough with the government—but privately, not publicly. Again:
                    I thought the question of democracy and the pace of political development had to
                    be decided by Koreans themselves. If South Korea were to become a true
                    democracy, it had to be done by the citizens on their own and for themselves. To
                    do it just to please the Americans, a) would not have worked and b) would not
                    have lasted.</p>
                <p>I was not overly concerned that the process of democratization would increase
                    instability on the Peninsula because I think the Korean military, as it had done
                    so often in the past, would step right in and quell any movements that might
                    endanger the security of the nation. In any case, I did not believe that there
                    would be a revolution. I did admit that it was a possibility; I was willing to
                    grant that there might have been a repetition of the 1960 student uprisings. I
                    thought that if such an event were to occur, let it happen; it might have been
                    necessary for the political development. It would have been a case in which the
                    Korean people might be taking serious risks, even endangering their lives. I
                    full expected that some blood might flow in the streets. I felt very strongly
                    that the US, in no way or shape, should have promoted that or even given any
                    kind of sign of approbation. I fully anticipated another 1960 uprising, but I
                    certainly was opposed to us being cited as an instigator or opposer under any
                    kind of pretext. One could see the political pressure building up as the middle
                    class grew. All of my Korean contacts would essentially give me the same
                    message—in carefully phrased words. It was time to open the political process.
                    Toward the end of my tour, there were occasional student uprisings, but I think
                    the prevailing mood in the middle class was that of anger and resentment and
                    disrespect for Chun Doo Hwan particularly, but no desire for open
                    confrontations.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Neither Chun or his wife ever won the respect of the Korean people—at least those
                    with whom I had contacts—the middle class, academics, business people and even
                    some military. All of them referred to Chun Doo Hwan in disparaging terms; they
                    called him “stone head”—he was bald. They thought that Chun's wife had a very
                    sharp chin—i.e. they thought that she and her family were deeply involved in
                    major corruption. This was a strong negative under-current, which grew as the
                    middle class grew and felt stronger and stronger. I think that at least some of
                    the government officials understood what was going on in Korea. On one occasion,
                    Park Gun Woo at a session at the Nadja Hotel coffee shop—where we met when we
                    had important matters to discuss—literally broke down and cried. I was stunned;
                    I had never seen a Korean cry and to have an official do so was unforgettable.
                    Park had just been in the US with Chun Doo Hwan on a visit. He and the Foreign
                    Minister had during the flight back been called into the President's cabin for
                    dialogue. Park said that the only thing Chun could talk about was “his personal
                    survival.” He was deeply embarrassed and outraged that the President of his
                    country would be so obsessed with that issue. It was clear to Gun that his
                    government had become so dictatorial that the leader of it was solely concerned
                    with his own survival. He thought that Korea deserved better than that. And he
                    sobbed.</p>
                <p>That much was very different from my experiences in 1974-77. I never had (then) a
                    Foreign Ministry official break down like that. It is true that even during my
                    first tour, I would occasionally pick up rumblings of discontent with Park Chung
                    Hee, but they were not nearly as audible as during my second. That in part may
                    have been also the result of not knowing the Koreans as well during the 1970s as
                    I did in the 1980s, but I don't believe the contempt that my contacts showed for
                    Park Chung Hee was anything compared to that which they exhibited towards Chun
                    Doo Hwan. It may well have been that as Park tightened the political screws,
                    people got madder and madder, but I think Park always commanded more respect
                    than Chun.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>As I said, there were rumblings about corruption at the highest level. But I must
                    confess that I was not aware of the depth and extent of the corruption as has
                    been subsequently made public. I assumed, as my Korean friends used to tell me,
                    that corruption was part of Korean life and that contractors were paying some
                    bribes in exchange for being given business. The Korean business process was
                    just rife with that kind of corruption. I was once told by a business leader
                    that every New Year's Day, he would pay calls and leave envelopes stuffed with
                    money on the desks of the bureaucrats he and his corporation did business with.
                    But I don't think I really understood the extent of this practice. I didn't know
                    of instances of corruption. American firms were banned by US law from
                    participating in these practices and I think few if any firms behaved in corrupt
                    ways. They may well have had Korean agents that did the dirty work for them, but
                    I don't know that for a fact. I don't think we ever had evidence that US
                    companies were involved in bribery; I talked to many American businessmen, whom
                    I knew well and trusted, who told me that there probably were Korean agents that
                    paid off officials in order to get contracts for American firms. Of course,
                    these agents made a handsome profit themselves if the awards were granted and
                    could well have shared their profits with some Korean officials, but we never
                    got any specifics or even allegations that we could pursue. However, the Station
                    Chiefs may have specifics.</p>
                <p>There was one exception to my general comment, which concerned me deeply. In
                    Korea, there was a Saemaul (New Village) movement—started many years earlier by
                    Park Chung Hee and designed to help the rural communities. Chun Doo Hwan put his
                    brother in charge of that movement. Saemaul was always a grass roots operation;
                    the participants all wore distinct baseball hats with logos on them. I always
                    thought that it was essentially a political movement. Money was given to members
                    somewhat akin to “walking around” money known in some US cities. These funds
                    were intended to buy for the government political support in the communities—by
                    1982, it had spread far beyond the rural areas; you could find subgroups
                    belonging to the movement in every city and even in the government's ministries.
                    But when Chun's brother took over, it became clear to me that the he was using
                    this organization to corrupt the country politically—it became an enforcer of
                    government policies and a propaganda tool. Saemaul, in 1982, was a much more
                    powerful and more worrisome organization than it had been in the 1974-77 period,
                    although even then I was concerned about the possibility of the movement being
                    perverted to suit the President's political motives and becoming a troublesome
                    political issue. Under Chun's brother's aegis, it reported directly to the
                    President and became a tool for his repressive regime. So it was more powerful
                    and more insidious.</p>
                <p>There was a government party of which Chun Doo Hwan was the leader. But the
                    Saemaul movement became a personal, political and economic arm of the
                    President's through his brother. It became an avenue through which the President
                    could exert influence and pressure on the population. That concerned me deeply.
                    There were three Ho's—three people with the same last name who had been colonels
                    and who Chun had brought into the government in key jobs. One of the
                    Ho's—perhaps the smartest and the toughest—was assigned to Saemaul after Chun's
                    brother took over.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>One day, in the summer of 1985, Carter and I were virtually summoned—”It would be
                    in your interest to be there”—out to Saemaul headquarters—a large park near the
                    Seoul airport with lots of exhibits—for its annual celebration. I thought at the
                    time that the request for my appearance had somewhat of a threatening tone to
                    it.</p>
                <p>Our “invitation” may have come because I may have been reported to the government
                    as having been critical of the movement. An American company was getting
                    involved with the Chuns on a very sensitive government contract and I was
                    following that deal closely. There was an “open” bidding procedure, but it
                    became clear to us that Chun's brother was being used to help this one American
                    company to win the competition. Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering (CE), and
                    General Electric were bidding for the contract to construct two new nuclear
                    power plants. Combustion Engineering had come to me at the beginning of this
                    process and I had given them the standard briefing about the situation in Korea.
                    Westinghouse had been in Korea for many years and therefore didn't need the
                    briefing. Soon after that briefing, Combustion Engineering brought a consultant
                    to Seoul from Southern California. That gentleman told me a little about their
                    strategy which included somehow joining forces with Saemaul, which would make
                    the President's brother their agent. I immediately told him about my concerns
                    about this movement because a CE alliance with Saemaul would involve the
                    American company in some of the darker parts of Korean politics.</p>
                <p>Later, the Seoul representative of CE came in to see me and I again repeated my
                    concerns about his company's plans to use Chun's brother as their agent, using
                    Saemaul in some way or other. I told him that if CE wanted to use brother Chun
                    and the movement, that was CE's business, but that the company should be aware
                    of my concerns about getting in bed with Saemaul. I told him quite a lot about
                    that movement—the CIA as well as many of my own contacts knew a considerable
                    amount about what was going on—, including specific case citations which were
                    the cause of some of my concerns. I told the CE representative that he and his
                    company were going to run some serious risks by using Chun's brother. I had no
                    doubt that it might have been a good way to get to the President; on the other
                    hand, if the whole story were told—as it probably would be eventually—there was
                    a serious possibility that CE would be barred from doing any further work in
                    Korea. I thought that CE should have all views before it reached a decision. I
                    was rather blunt in my assessment and the CE man left thanking me profusely. I
                    think he was grateful for the information.</p>
                <p>In about two or three weeks, the CE consultant from California came to see me
                    again, furious—he was close to threatening me. He pointed out the stakes for CE
                    and the involvement of a lot of high level people in the Korea deal. He told me
                    that Judge Clark, the former Assistant to President Reagan for National Security
                    affairs, was a member of the consulting firm. So this was a high stakes game. I
                    might add that this representative of the consulting firm had also worked in the
                    White House. I suspect that he had a hand in the “invitation” I received from
                    Saemaul. I frankly cannot remember his name.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>As I said, the “invitation” to the Saemaul celebration came almost as an order,
                    in threatening tones. I did go with my wife, Carter. She was sort of bemused,
                    but I wanted her there as a witness. We were given a lot of time and attention
                    by Chun's brother, shown around as VIPs, etc. I was given the “premier” tour
                    with all the propaganda about Saemaul's great achievements and deeds. It was a
                    Potemkin Village operation if I had ever seen one. I listened carefully and
                    smiled everywhere. My assumption was that Chun's brother and Ho had heard of my
                    misgivings about the movement and were trying to influence me to take a
                    different point of view.</p>
                <p>Following the tour, I was asked to come see Judge Clark. I should mention that at
                    the time I was the Charge'—the Ambassador was away. I went to the Chosun Hotel
                    to meet with the Judge. He talked to me in his most gracious and disarming
                    manner—about nothing that was of great interest to me (essentially about all the
                    projects he was involved in, including the “Three Gorges” project in China which
                    he had just visited). Finally, in a very soft voice, he said that he hoped that
                    the Embassy would support the CE bid. I told him that since three American firms
                    were bidding, we certainly couldn't favor one over the others. He said he
                    understood that, but he hoped that we would give CE advice and support “as
                    appropriate.”</p>
                <p>As I was being ushered out—still wondering what this little act was all about—out
                    of the suite's second bedroom appeared another American. I immediately
                    recognized him. It was Lynn Nofzinger—a major player in American politics. We
                    had never met, but I knew him immediately from photographs that I had seen in
                    the press. He came over to me, put his arm around my shoulder as we were walking
                    to the elevator and said: “Paul, we are not going to have any troubles, are we?”
                    It was obvious that he was referring to my concerns about Saemaul, about which
                    he had undoubtedly heard from the Combustion Engineering. I knew that at that
                    time, my name was in the White House as a candidate for the ambassadorship to
                    New Zealand. There was no question in my mind that Clark and Nofzinger knew that
                    too. I was furious with their tactics, but there really wasn't anything further
                    I could do. I felt that I was personally threatened and that in their subtle
                    way, these guys had put me on notice that my future in the Foreign Service was
                    at stake. I think that Nofzinger in fact even referred to my “golden future” in
                    the Service. I certainly felt that a message was being sent to me; I resented
                    that deeply and was furious. I have told this story to many people, including
                    the press—on background. I am still mad about.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>What upset the consultant firm I presume was that I was giving advice to CE—as
                    well as them—which was at odds with what it was saying to CE—in fact they told
                    me that outright and that was confirmed to me by CE. As I said, the CE
                    representative in Seoul had listened very carefully to me and appeared
                    appreciative of my briefings. He had obviously reported what he had heard back
                    to headquarters in the US. It was the same comments that I had made to the
                    representative of the consulting firm. In any event, CE hired Chun's brother as
                    their agent and did indeed win the contract for the nuclear plants. So my advice
                    may have not been good, but it was clear to me that any American firm that asked
                    should be given the benefit of all of our knowledge about Saemaul and my
                    concerns about the risks of dealing with Chun's brother.</p>
                <p>There was another major business transaction that was very much alive during my
                    tour. I refer to the F-16 vs. F-18 competition, which actually began when I had
                    been in the Political Section in the 1970s. I remember when the General Dynamics
                    people first arrived in my office in the mid-1970s. At the beginning of the
                    competition among American manufacturers of fighter aircraft, Northrop with its
                    F-5 was also involved, but it dropped out of contention fairly early in the
                    game. So by the time I became DCM, it was General Dynamics' F-16 vs. McDonald
                    and the F-18. I don't remember any allegations of illegal activities involved in
                    this huge sale potential. Both companies used to come to the Embassy for
                    briefings and discussions. I was always as even handed as I could be. In fact,
                    there wasn't very much that the Embassy could do in that situation.
                    Representations on the companies' behalf was really unnecessary; both had good
                    connections with the Korean military and the Ministry of Defense. We would just
                    tell them what we had heard when they came to the Embassy and the
                    representatives of both companies would tell us some of what they knew.</p>
                <p>The 1982-85 period was quite active on the commercial side. There were many
                    American companies eager to do business in Korea. The corruption that was rife
                    in Korea—unrelated to US business—was partially known to us, although, as I
                    said, the magnitude that was uncovered later came as a surprise to me. It was
                    well known that Chun's wife and her family were involved in bribery. I suspect
                    that the corruption was probably worse than it had been during my previous tour.
                    That may have been due to Chun or perhaps I was simply more knowledgeable about
                    Korea during my second tour than I was in the first. I think the Chun regime was
                    more venal than Park's had been, just as I thought it was more dictatorial than
                    Park's had been. I never had the same respect for Chun Doo Hwan that I had for
                    Park Chung Hee. But I could be wrong. Neither were kind and gentle rulers; both
                    were very tough; and Park was very smart as well. It is this intellectual
                    capability that I think distinguished Park from Chun.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>We did initiate a long term battle with the Korean government in those days over
                    what we considered unfair trade practices—import restrictions, high tariffs,
                    etc. These practices of course were in effect when I served in Seoul the first
                    time, but by the early 1980s, the Korean economy was bigger and US commercial
                    interests in Korea had increased greatly. That meant that as a government, we
                    became much more active in the 1980s in trying to get the Koreans to open their
                    economic system to US investments and imports. Korea exported about one-third of
                    its GNP of which 1/3 went to the US. That made us a major market for Korean
                    exports. But the trade was not reciprocal. As I said, there were major
                    barriers—both tariff and non-tariff. The Koreans were also stealing our
                    intellectual properties. The IBM representative told me one time that the
                    Koreans were such good copiers of memory chips that they used to even mark the
                    US patent number on the chips they manufactured—without paying royalties to the
                    US patent holder.</p>
                <p>So we faced major trade impediments, as there had always been, except that by the
                    early 1980s, Korea was beginning to be a major producer in the world, no longer
                    dependent on hand-outs. I decided that it was time to go after the Koreans on
                    their trade practices. I started to chair a weekly meeting with the three senior
                    economic officers in the Embassy—the Economic, Commercial and Agricultural
                    Counselors (Don McConville, George Griffin and Dan Conable). Initially, this
                    meeting was intended to bring them up to date on political issues which they
                    felt had not been adequately brought to their attention. But it became very
                    apparent that they really weren't that interested in political issues; so we
                    made trade issues the main agenda topic. I think it was one of the best things I
                    have ever done in the Foreign Service. The three officers began to vent their
                    frustrations and I began to understand the major barriers that the Koreans had
                    erected against imports and investments. Finally, I asked the three to develop a
                    series of messages to Washington, describing the problems as they saw them—in
                    detail—and concluding with a series of recommendations on actions that should be
                    taken. I also charged them to draft a speech for the Ambassador which would be
                    delivered to an audience of top Korean economists and industrialists. The tone
                    of that speech was to be tough because we did not want Korea to become a second
                    Japan—highly protectionist. It is true that for years, Washington had raised
                    these issues with the Koreans, but they weren't really pursued very diligently.
                    I wanted a different, more comprehensive, more public approach to an old
                    subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>So we put together some massive documentation of Korean delinquencies. I think we
                    really stirred Washington up with this series of telegrams. In fact, we must
                    have been the first—or among the first—to take a host country to task for its
                    commercial behavior. Washington seemed to receive our communications with some
                    pleasure. So over the years, starting in 1984, we started a major campaign to
                    break Korean protectionism. Dixie's speech was the first shot. Nam Duk Woo—the
                    former Deputy PM and senior Korean in the commercial field—was visibly annoyed
                    by Dixie's speech; he was not accustomed to an American ambassador calling “a
                    spade a spade.” When I asked him about the speech, he shrugged his shoulders,
                    suggesting that if the American Ambassador wanted to talk that way, he couldn't
                    prevent it, but it would not be taken very seriously. I think the speech was
                    only a first step and by itself, would not have made much of an impact. It was
                    followed by a comprehensive enduring program which through our actions was to
                    make it clear to the Koreans that we would do everything within our power to
                    prevent them from becoming another Japan. I think Washington came to the
                    conclusion that if an embassy could do this—an institution not known as an
                    aggressive combatant of host country mistaken policies—it should join in. I
                    don't know what the Washington institutions did on their own to pressure the
                    Koreans, but I do know that they welcomed our proposals and supported us
                    fully.</p>
                <p>As I suggested, our program started about 12 months before my departure. I was
                    not there long enough to see the fruits of out initiative, but I was very
                    pleased that we started the ball rolling. I can't say enough for the efforts of
                    the economic counselors. Dan Conable—a nephew of the Congressman and World Bank
                    President—was our Agricultural Counselor; George Griffin was the Commercial
                    Counselor following a stint as a Political Counselor in India—where he was
                    accused by Indira Gandhi of being a CIA agent, forcing him to change
                    specializations for a while—and Don McConville, the Economic Counselor. The
                    three were superb and worked together in admirable fashion. The reports to
                    Washington and the recommendations were essentially theirs; I served primarily
                    as a catalyst. The local American Chamber of Commerce was appreciative of our
                    efforts. The days of “kudos” from US private business had not yet arrived fully,
                    but the Chamber was supportive. I used to see a lot of the American business
                    community; the Embassy's doors were always open to them. Dixie had excellent
                    rapport with the business community. He spent a lot of time with them. We saved
                    the Chamber on one occasion when it may not have been altogether happy with us.
                    It had prepared a booklet of a 150 pages or so of “do's and don'ts in Korea.”
                    Fortunately, they brought the draft to us to read before issuing it. That was
                    fortunate because had it been published as written, American business in Korea
                    would have been dead for many years thereafter. It was a most undiplomatic
                    document; it referred to Koreans as always smelling of “Kimchi”, as being “back
                    stabbers”, etc. I found it hard to believe that anyone living and doing business
                    in Seoul would have written that sort of stuff. Not only was it wrong on its
                    merits, but that anyone would have ever dreamed of saying things like that about
                    their hosts was hard to believe.</p>

                <p>I might note that I did detect some change in Korean attitude towards the US in
                    those days. I think that the students' resentment of US policies in the early
                    1980s was greater than it had been in the mid-1970s—certainly I was more aware
                    of it. In my second tour, everything was somewhat more radicalized; there was no
                    question that political pressures were building as I have suggested. The Kwangju
                    events of 1980 were still resonating in those years as indeed they still
                    periodically surface even today. The students would not let go of that subject;
                    that increasingly put us on the defensive trying to explain why we were not
                    responsible for the actions of the Korean military because we had not released
                    those troops from the UN command. It is doubtful that even if we had wished or
                    commanded, that we could have stopped them from marching on Kwangju and
                    committing the mayhem they did. I think it was clear that if the ROK military
                    decided that it was needed to quell domestic unrest, no orders form a US general
                    would have stopped them. But the question of US involvement or complicity kept
                    arising, particularly during the student riots in 1984. Kwangju became a
                    political football, used by the opposition parties to bring pressure on the
                    government. I remember that Steve Bradner, who was the CINC's political
                    advisor—whom I have mentioned before—and I worked very diligently on a “White
                    Paper” which was intended to be a description of the actual events of 1980. The
                    bottom line of the paper was that the US was absolved of any responsibility for
                    the actions of the Korean military for the reasons I have mentioned. In fact,
                    1980 was somewhat of a repeat of 1960 when we had also found that we had no
                    control over Korean military when it was faced by prospects of domestic unrest.
                    Then, Park Chung Hee had taken troops right out of the front lines on the DMZ
                    and moved them into Seoul to occupy strategic places. In any case, when Steve
                    and I finished the report, we wanted to issue it publically, but it was not. I
                    believe the Department thought it wiser not to, that it would create more
                    controversy and not resolve the issue. We wanted to issue it because we thought
                    it desirable to be out in front with our story to try to head off any more
                    adverse publicity. In fact, after I left Seoul, a “White Paper” was issued by
                    the Department; I think it would have been better if we had done it earlier
                    because when we did release it, I believe it was under pressure from the
                    National Assembly and then it looked a rationale, rather than a forthright
                    statement of events and the limitations of the UN command structure. Both Steve
                    and I assumed that sooner or later, the US would have to publish a written
                    commentary and we thought sooner would be better.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>As I said, the Kwangju issue never seems to be buried. Most people have a natural
                    instinct, and that is certainly true for the Koreans, to blame someone else for
                    their own misfortune. Kwangju is also a convenient issue for those who would use
                    it to pursue their own political agenda. Some people—like Americans—blame their
                    government for their problems. In the case of Chun Doo Hwan, there was certainly
                    cause to blame the Korean government for some of the misfortunes that afflicted
                    the Koreans; but it was also convenient to blame the US because we did have a
                    pro-consul image in the minds of many Koreans. We did indeed help sustain a
                    series of Korean governments that might not have passed the “democratic”
                    standard. We did maintain a relationship with Chun, Park and Rhee because the
                    stability of the Peninsula was our most important objective. So in the minds of
                    the opposition and the students, we were seen as power behind the throne and
                    therefore subject to their criticism. I think historians will have a major
                    debate on whether we unnecessarily propped up dictatorial regimes thereby
                    placing political development in Korea far behind stability and security. I
                    think if we were prepared to use the full range of our powers—using only legal
                    means—and if we were prepared to run the risk of a North attack, we probably
                    could have undermined the Chun regime. We would have had to use economic
                    sanctions, troop withdrawals, etc. and even a public attack on Chun. Then, we
                    might have brought Chun down. Such actions, however, even if successful, might
                    not be responsible in light of the risks that they engendered. I don't think
                    that there was any sentiment in the US government to take such drastic actions,
                    given the risks and in light of the economic development blossoming in Korea,
                    which was going to create a base for gradual political development. As I said,
                    it was always my opinion that democracy would come to Korea when the Koreans
                    themselves were ready for it—i.e. when economic growth had resulted in a
                    critical middle class mass.</p>
                <p>I believe that in fact that is how matters developed in Korea. The peaceful
                    passage of political leadership from Chun Doo Hwan to Rho Tae Woo to a complete
                    democratic process really was beyond my wildest dreams and hopes. I had
                    anticipated a violent passage from autocracy to democracy. If the US was
                    responsible for anything that went on in Korea than we should be given credit
                    for assisting this expansion of political rights to the Korean people. We
                    assisted first in the economic recovery of the country after the war, then in
                    its economic development and then in its political development.</p>
                <p>The issue of political growth in Korea was an issue that we discussed frequently
                    in the 1982-85 period. I wrote about the size of the middle class, its
                    continuing growth and the political demands for power that it would eventually
                    make on the government. During the 1984-85 period, I saw Rho Tae Woo
                    periodically; he was then the head of the Olympic Committee. He was much more
                    reasonable, accessible and diplomatic than his classmate Chun Doo Hwan. I
                    thought that Rho was undoubtedly a powerful figure who might be instrumental in
                    some way in bringing change to the Korean political process. I viewed him as
                    someone who could be a good influence, although I had no idea that he would
                    succeed Chun—after I left Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>David Blakemore and I felt very strongly about the need for increased political
                    power sharing to include the ever growing Korean middle class. After Dave's
                    departure, our faith in Korea's future was really tested. In 1985—I think—a
                    group of students took over the library in our USIA building. They sat down and
                    refused to leave. They started to write political messages on the windows. That
                    started a major debate with the Korean government. The police immediately wanted
                    permission to enter the building and drag out the students. I opposed that
                    vigorously; I wanted to try to see whether we couldn't convince them to leave
                    peacefully. So we sent Harry Dunlop, our Political Counselor, to start a
                    dialogue with the students; that lasted three days. He just kept talking to
                    them. He did a magnificent job. In the meantime, in the Embassy, there was major
                    ongoing debate. I, Steve Bradner and several other senior officers wanted to
                    continue the dialogue; there were others, like the Station Chief and the
                    Security Officer, who wanted the students ejected forcibly. We did not want to
                    use the police; we thought that given time, we could talk the students out of
                    the building. We had a very responsible and thorough discussion, chaired by
                    Dixie. He was a great chairman listening patiently to both sides and maintaining
                    order and civility. The pro-police action people were concerned about the US
                    image—we looked “weak” and “vacillating.” The Korean government would certainly
                    never have permitted this “disorder” to continue. In the final analysis, Dixie
                    sided with us “weak kneed diplomats”, even though the government—including the
                    Foreign Ministry, I believe—began to apply increasing pressure on us to let
                    their police into the building to drag the students out. The government felt
                    that the incident was an embarrassment to Korea, as I suppose it was.</p>
                <p>By the third day, the events at the USIA building were becoming well known
                    throughout Seoul, even though the media was not allowed to give it any coverage.
                    The students wrote their political testaments on the windows so that all
                    passerby knew what was going on. Of course, with each passing day, the number of
                    Korean spectators increased, so that what the US was doing about the student
                    invasion was well known throughout the city.</p>
                <p>While Harry Dunlap continued the dialogue with the students, we also talked
                    incessantly with Washington. CIA experts on “hostage” situations were brought in
                    to counsel us over the phone. There were questions about whether we should bring
                    food and liquids to the students. I talked to Paul Wolfowitz, the Assistant
                    Secretary on a couple of occasions. We received a tremendous amount of attention
                    and good support. One day, when I had to go to the USIA building to talk to
                    Dunlap, someone took my picture which then appeared in the “New York Times”.
                    Then I got calls from all over the US, from friends who wanted to know what I
                    was doing. I think the US press gave us very good and favorable coverage. My
                    Korean friends—like Yi Hong Goo (recently the Prime Minister and then a
                    university professor), who were essentially spectators, gave me good feed-back.
                    They advised us to continue down our path; it was good advice which we followed.
                    Eventually, the students left the building and the issue was resolved peacefully
                    and I think to our credit.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>My motivation during those days was my belief, shared by Steve Bradner—who
                    essentially represented the UN command—and many others, that the USIA incident
                    was an opportunity to show the Koreans how democracy really works. It is a
                    system that required dialogue and patience and certainly abhors force such as
                    the police would have undoubtedly used—when the issue was a political one. The
                    great irony was that when Dunlop, after three grueling days, finally talked the
                    students into leaving the building and we had negotiated a peaceful exit and
                    departure, as the students hit the street, the police grabbed them and threw
                    them in paddy wagons. You could see the billy clubs flying inside the wagons,
                    but we made strong representations and most of the students were released by the
                    police within 12 hours and sent home. Some of the ring leaders were jailed and
                    sentenced to jail, even though we did not press trespassing charges against the
                    students.</p>
                <p>All this happened in a period when we were having problems with hostage taking in
                    the Middle East and other places. Our situation was not a hostage situation, but
                    some saw it as US inability to protect its own people and property. In fact, it
                    was a signal lesson on democratic development, which rarely moves without some
                    disruptions.</p>
                <p>Let me now return to comment about the security situation on the Peninsula. By
                    1982, we had passed through the time during which President Carter had announced
                    plans to withdraw the 2nd Division. Although that never materialized, the very
                    announcement raised the threat of a Northern invasion. Our intelligence
                    indicated that the North had moved more troops and equipment to the front lines.
                    Whether the North's movements were linked to Carter's words or happened
                    coincidentally, I don't know, but it as clear that the North was strengthening
                    its position above the 38th Parallel. By 1982, the North was in a much more
                    threatening posture than had been true in 1977. Nevertheless, I did not believe
                    that the North was a greater threat than it had been earlier. In fact, I
                    remember Dick Ericson telling me that in about 1968, the North had really been
                    aggressive and that there had been many serious fire fights with many
                    casualties. That was followed by the “Blue House raid” and the “Pueblo”
                    incident. So in the late 1960s and early 1970s the tension were very high. I did
                    not think that that was the situation in 1982.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>My concern for the troop build up was also always ameliorated by the fact that
                    there hadn't been any prolonged major instances of North-South violent
                    confrontation either along the DMZ or anywhere else. There were incidents such
                    as the one in the China Sea that I mentioned earlier. I mean there were always
                    minor incidents of fire exchanges—in which people died—but I didn't feel that
                    any ever developed into serious situations. The South of course always painted a
                    very dark picture of the threat; after all, it was in Chun's interest to do so
                    since it gave him reason to maintain a high state of security alert and to
                    repress his own people in the name of “security”. In my mind, the Korean
                    government's continual harping on the threat from the North became something
                    like the little boy who continually cried “wolf.” It kept talking about the
                    imminent major attack, which of course never came. After a while, I think that
                    line ceased to have much impact on me, although from time to time, tensions
                    along the DMZ rose and fell, as they had done since the end of the Korean war.
                    There were periodic clashes, but, as I suggested, none that indicated that the
                    North was considering any major attack. Our intelligence collection capability
                    had increased technically from my previous tour, but we never had agents in the
                    North and therefore lacked real good intelligence. Without that input, it was
                    very difficult if not impossible to divine the thought of Kim Il Sung and his
                    cohorts. What we knew—which was militarily important—was from technical means
                    observations, but on political questions, we knew practically nothing.</p>
                <p>One event that I can well remember was Private White's defection to North Korea.
                    That raised a major concern for General Sennewald, who took it as a real blow to
                    our military, and it occupied the command's attention for an extended period.
                    Another was the defection of a young Soviet diplomat, who was on the North
                    Korean side of the truce village and all of sudden dashed to the South across
                    the line that had been drawn down the middle of the village after the “tree
                    cutting” incident of 1976. He was chased by a horde of North Korean soldiers,
                    who were immediately surrounded by Southern troops. Fortunately, the Swedish
                    Armistice Commission representative happen to be there at the time and at some
                    risk to his own life, managed to prevent any further collisions—probably the
                    death of the North Korean guards who were shooting ducks surrounded by our and
                    South Korean troops. He ordered the North troops to get back to their side of
                    the line and the incident never developed further. The Soviet defector was taken
                    by helicopter to Yongsan, where he was placed in a golf car and driven across
                    the golf course to a safe house. He was there for several days, undergoing
                    interrogation both from American and South Korean representatives. When he was
                    released by our authorities he went to Boston, attended Boston University I
                    believe and put himself through school by being a waiter. He was very bright; I
                    think I met him briefly while he was in one of our guest houses. He was well
                    guarded the whole time he was in Seoul for his own protection as well as ours.
                    As a relatively junior officer, he was not a fountain of information, but he was
                    important as a Soviet defector.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I have previously mentioned my opposition to taking visitors to the tunnels that
                    the North had dug under the DMZ. In the first place, it was a violation of the
                    truce agreement and secondly, it just reinforced that atmosphere of tensions
                    that “could break out in major fighting at any time.” As I said, I didn't think
                    that to be the case at all and therefore never took visitors to the tunnels nor
                    did I go myself. The US military did and some of our Embassy people may have
                    done so. When Livsey succeeded Sennewald, the South Koreans proposed the
                    construction of a restaurant in the DMZ, along with observation towers to look
                    at the “perfidious” tunnels. It was a sheer propaganda effort. The South felt
                    that since the North had violated the truce agreement by digging the tunnels,
                    the South had the right to build a restaurant and observation tower so that
                    people could see concrete evidence of the North's aggressive behavior. My
                    opposition was overridden and the building was begun in the DMZ.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Kim was still a major figure in Korea. I used to see him in the 1982-85
                    period as I had done earlier. As he was in the earlier period, I still found the
                    Cardinal to be one of the keenest observers of the Korean political scene. He
                    was very reliable, although he was very careful in his choice of words. You had
                    to listen very closely to understand his message. I certainly had the impression
                    that he felt that the domestic political situation was more tense than it had
                    been during my earlier tour and that in fact the situation was becoming
                    increasingly tense. I am sure that my views, as I have expressed them earlier,
                    were greatly influenced by the Cardinal's observations.</p>
                <p>I don't believe that our relationships with the American missionary community
                    improved much from the mid-1970 period. We were not in close contact with the
                    radical element, although we saw all of them and got along well with those
                    espousing more conservative views. I doubt that the more liberal missionaries
                    had any more favorable view of the Embassy than they had during my previous
                    tour. I think we had less contact with them, partly because the Maryknollers led
                    by Father Cochran were somewhat less vigorous in their condemnation of the South
                    Korean regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Father Bransfield—a scion of a rich brewery family—would come to see me
                    periodically. I liked Mike, and he used me as sort of “father confessor” which
                    is a strange role reversal in itself. He found it useful to talk to me. He
                    worked with Korean teenagers in Inchon; many of them apparently needed a lot of
                    help and the Father was doing his best. He did get involved to some extent in
                    “liberation” theology, which was alive and well among the Maryknollers. He came
                    to me one time because he had published a book, the writing of which I think was
                    still within tolerated limits. What was not acceptable was the drawings in the
                    book. One that I remember well was of Christ on the Cross, with a thousand
                    bleeding mouths all over his body. It was strange and horrifying, drawn by a
                    Korean youngster who in his anxiety to make a statement, had gone over the
                    bounds of decency. There were other drawings of big fat businessmen sitting on
                    small people from labor unions, etc. The drawings were just too much for the
                    regime and the book was banned. The government had suggested some remedial
                    action that might have taken the Father off the hook. He was faced with being
                    expelled—essentially—or doing what the ROK government had suggested. He wrestled
                    with the issue for a while and decided to accept the Korean government's
                    suggestions and stayed for a while longer working with the Korean kids.</p>
                <p>There were many incidents of that kind in the 1982-85 period. I once attended a
                    dinner meeting of radical Korean ministers. I did that partly at least to irk
                    the government. My attendance was well noted and a lot of people got really
                    upset with me. I admired those people who risked their lives to pursue political
                    issues about which they felt very strongly. I did spend a lot of my time on
                    political dissidents, such as Kim Dae Jung, Moon Ik Kwan and other “professional
                    prisoners”; i.e. people who dared the government to put them in prison. Some,
                    like Moon, I thought were kind of nutty, but I gave considerable thought to what
                    the US government could do about those problems of human rights violations. I
                    knew that we could only have a marginal impact, but every once in a while, when
                    some outrageous action had been taken by the government, I would go to a
                    Ministry and pound my fist on a desk.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I had known Kim Dae Jung from my first tour when I used to have regular contacts,
                    but in the 1982-85 period Dixie and I made a conscious decision that it would be
                    inappropriate for either the Ambassador or the DCM to see Kim; it would have
                    inflamed the government without any benefit either for Kim, the cause of human
                    rights or the US. But the Embassy did maintain contacts with him through the
                    Political Counselor. We also saw Mrs Kim at the Embassy on a couple of
                    occasions. In retrospect, perhaps I should have put up an effort vis a vis KDJ,
                    but it was clear that Dixie didn't want either of the top officers of the
                    Embassy to be seeing Kim Dae Jung. At one point, I think we received a cable
                    from Mike Armacost, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs asking whether
                    either the Ambassador or the DCM shouldn't make an effort to see Kim. Our
                    response was that any such action would bring a major response from the
                    government without benefit to anyone; it was not worth it. On the other hand, I
                    did see Kim Young Sam all the time; the two of us would occasionally go a
                    “Kisaeng” house—places which I knew; I would arrange an evening there with him,
                    although he didn't drink very much so that it was more or less a “working”
                    social occasion. Both Kims, I believe, came to the Residence at least once for a
                    Forth of July party in 1985. Kim Young Sam came to my house for lunch a couple
                    of times. He was an opposition leader but the government didn't fear him nearly
                    as much as it did Kim Dae Jung. In light of the political situation in Korea at
                    the time, it didn't really seem that either of the Kims nor any of the other
                    opposition leaders had much of a future.</p>
                <p>I must say that I viewed Kim Young Sam as a political opportunist. His
                    reputation, particularly among some of my academic friends, was that he was not
                    too smart. I suspect that that feeling may not have changed even now that he is
                    the President. My first hand impressions were not quite as stark as that; I
                    don't think we ever got many insights from him, but I suspect that he felt that
                    it was worthwhile having people know that he had contact with the American
                    Embassy; it was probably a plus for him. He always tried to cover all the
                    bases—that was a modus operandi that he had developed much earlier in his
                    career, and he kept it up for as long as I knew him.</p>
                <p>We had very good relationships with the Japanese Embassy. Ambassador Maeda had
                    served in Korea when he was a young man; so he knew the language. Unfortunately,
                    he also had learned to speak English, but his pronunciation was so bad one could
                    hardly understand him. Nevertheless, he, his DCM, and we had a “home to home”
                    lunch arrangement; one month we would meet at his residence and one month at
                    ours. I always felt that those exchanges benefitted the Japanese more than they
                    did us; we always had better information about Korean affairs, which is
                    understandable in light of the bitter view the Koreans and Japanese had of each
                    other. This was particularly true on military matters, where we obviously had a
                    major edge since we worked with the Korean military on a daily basis. We tried
                    to keep the Japanese informed on matters that raised tensions on the Peninsula
                    such as tunnels or planes flying near or over the DMZ or events in the Sea of
                    Japan. On the other hand, I think they may have withheld some material from us.
                    They viewed the Koreans through a different prism than we did. But the Japanese
                    did cooperate with us and I think in general it was a very profitable
                    relationship for both of us. There was not any discussion of commercial
                    issues—an area where we competed with them in Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>That brings me back to the nuclear plants. We did have European competition for
                    the construction of additional plants—the French and the Swiss. Framatone and
                    Asa Brown Boveri had been bidding for nuclear plant contracts for many years and
                    they were still involved in 1982-85. But I don't think we ever had to complain
                    about an “uneven playing field” or “unusual” French or Swiss tactics. The French
                    Ambassador was a very good personal friend—he just retired as Consul General in
                    New York and I don't ever recall complaining to him about any Framatone
                    tactics.I mentioned earlier our major anti-fraud visa efforts. I would like to
                    talk at greater length about that. Ken Keller, the Consul General, and I arrived
                    in Seoul at about the same time. My first reaction to Ken was that he was a
                    somewhat dour man; he was certainly taciturn. He was born near the Idaho-Canada
                    border where he lived on a “stump” farm—i.e. where all the trees had been cut
                    down leaving just the stumps. As I mentioned, I learned that he was in fact a
                    brilliant officer; he had graduated from the University of Montana with a
                    straight 4.0 grade average. As part of my general routine, I used to have
                    regular meetings with Ken, during which he would keep me informed about the
                    operations of his section. Bruce Beardsley was Ken's deputy. They set up a
                    rigorous system of inspections of the visa operations. There had been rumors
                    about fraud in the Consular Section for many, many years with allegations being
                    made that it was possible to buy visas. Ken apparently had done a lot of work on
                    this issue even before he arrived and when he arrived, he issued a set of
                    guidelines for his young officers. Following these guidelines not too many
                    months later, one of these young officers—Mark Fitzpatrick, a brilliant fellow
                    who later worked for me in Wellington—was reviewing a visa petition from Los
                    Angeles, in support of a Korean trying to emigrate. It looked funny to him; so
                    he reviewed the previous day's visa petitions and found a petition filed
                    allegedly by some one in New York. He concluded from the identical “typewritten
                    signature” that the two petitions must have been typed on the same typewriter.
                    That brought him to the hypothesis that in fact both petitions had in fact been
                    typed in Seoul, down the street in one of the many visa broker's offices.</p>
                <p>That was a first clue. By going through files, Keller and his staff found
                    approximately 1000 fraudulent visas—immigrant and non-immigrant—that had been
                    issued in the previous six months. This was the result of a careful, thorough
                    step by step investigation which finally resulted in the termination of 11 local
                    employees and police raids on four visa brokerage firms. Among other things, we
                    found that our messenger, a Korean employee who used to deliver the unclassified
                    mail in his shopping cart, used to screen all the visa material that had come
                    from the States. He would take all interesting visa correspondence to one of
                    these brokerage houses, turning those outfits into replicas of an Embassy visa
                    office—filled with all the forms and petitions. In fact, these brokerage houses
                    could process all visa applications with these, forging all the required
                    documents. Whatever official assistance they needed, they got from our Korean
                    employees.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>With the assistance of those eleven corrupted employees, the brokers were making
                    small fortunes. They were charging $10,000 for an immigrant visa and $5,000 for
                    a non-immigrant visa. Ken Keller deserves the full credit for unmasking and
                    pursuing this fraud; it was brilliant work. He recruited assistance from a
                    variety of intelligence and military units. He managed to penetrate one of the
                    fraudulent operations. From time to time, Washington experts would come out and
                    provide advice, but it was mostly Keller and the Embassy.</p>
                <p>There was minimal assistance from the Korean government; that was very
                    frustrating and upset me no end. I took Ken to see then Secretary General Lee
                    Bum Suk—a friend and a well known Americaphile, who was unfortunately killed in
                    Burma along with many of his colleagues in that North Korean terrorist action.
                    In any case, Lee listened, but nothing happened. The ROK was just not
                    interested; it was in its interest to have as many Koreans leave Korea as
                    possible; perhaps it made control easier. In any event, it didn't care that
                    someone got an illegal immigrant visa or that one person moved ahead of his or
                    her fellow citizens in the long wait for a visa. It was no skin off the
                    government's nose. What actions the government did take were symbolic at best.
                    At the root of all the problems was of course the fact that although we issued
                    30,000 immigrant visas each year to Koreans the demand far outstripped the legal
                    limitation. Given that situation, there was bound to be bribery and malfeasance;
                    I don't know how far it went, but it certainly did involve a number of our own
                    employees—almost entirely Korean although there was at least one American
                    suspect. There may over the years have been more Americans involved in this
                    traffic, but we will never know.</p>
                <p>Keller was very distressed by his predecessor's lack of action. In fact, that
                    officer went on to Manila where I believe he was caught in a corruption case.
                    Apparently he was not a paragon of virtue. Ken's serious pursuit of the fraud
                    started in 1982 and lasted through my tour in Seoul even after Ken was replaced
                    my last year by Andy Antippas. It was Ken's view—a correct one, I believe—that
                    you can never in a Korean situation completely eliminate fraud and bribery; you
                    just had to be continually vigilant. Andy was not quite as diligent about the
                    issues as Ken had been; neither were some Ambassadors who followed Dixie. These
                    people I think were much too cavalier about caring whether someone illegally
                    went to the head of the waiting list; their attitude was almost “Oh, well, they
                    are all Korean and what do we care which Koreans get in?” I think that was a
                    totally unacceptable view. The last person on the waiting list might come up for
                    eligibility in ten or fifteen years; if he or she kept getting bypassed by line
                    jumpers, they would never get an immigrant visa. The applicant who jumped the
                    waiting list did so by bribery and obtaining fraudulent petitions. I think it
                    was an entirely unacceptable practice which we, as Americans, could absolutely
                    not condone. It may not have made any difference to the number of Koreans who
                    would have immigrated into the US; that was set by law, but it did make a
                    difference to which Koreans were admitted, when.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>In addition, there were non-immigrant applicants who through these fraudulent
                    brokerage system obtained visas with full intention to remain in the US and then
                    apply for “green cards” or somehow set up permanent residence in the US. Again,
                    there were too many of our staff who were not sufficiently disturbed by that
                    practice. They couldn't care whether the Koreans cheated on each other or even
                    on us. As I said, I think that view was erroneous and damaging to our own image.
                    By the time I left, we had cleaned out the corruption in our own visa section—at
                    least that we knew about. But the pressure to get a visa continued and I suspect
                    that some of the fraud was still going on and probably still does today—as it
                    probably does in every visa issuance establishment where demand exceeds supply.
                    My view was that although I knew that we would not put an end to the fraud and
                    abuse, we had an obligation to pursue it and minimize it to the greatest extent
                    possible. That was Keller's view and he convinced me of its correctness.</p>
                <p>Let me now briefly comment on my recollections of the KAL 007 incident. I believe
                    that the first report of the incident came from our military, although it took a
                    number of days before we really knew what had happened. It was a tremendous
                    tragedy that brought shock to all. I knew the sister of one of the victims; many
                    of the people in the Embassy knew someone who was either in the plane or was
                    related to one of the victims. So the tragedy was heartfelt in the American
                    community, as well as the Korean one. The first days were consumed by general
                    grief and concern. Dixie was at his best under such circumstances. Then began
                    the difficult task of reconstructing events. We knew fairly early that Flight
                    KAL 007 had gone down, but why and precisely where took time to discover. It was
                    the Indication Center at Yongsan (a military intelligence unit) that began to
                    put the pieces of information together. From Northern Japan—a listening post—it
                    had taped the conversation between the Soviet fighter pilots and their ground
                    controllers. That gave us clear evidence of what had happened. The pilot had
                    been ordered to shoot by a controller in Central Russia. I believe that the
                    incident was not a deliberate provocation by anyone, but rather a Russian error
                    in judgement—that is confusion about the nature of the plane that had wandered
                    off course. The Soviets simply made a wrong decision to shoot it down, and I
                    think the tapes proved that.</p>
                <p>Washington was soon heard from trying to get information. We then became very
                    busy trying to fill in the blanks. In a few days, President Reagan took to the
                    airwaves blasting the Soviet action in his characteristically “evil empire”
                    fashion. He blasted them for purposefully shooting down a civilian flight and
                    killing many innocent civilians. I was not at all happy with the Reagan speech
                    because by that time we in Seoul had come to understand the error that the
                    Soviets made; I thought Reagan's accusation did not altogether fit the facts—at
                    least as we knew them. I don't condone the Soviet action; it was bad judgement
                    and they should be held accountable. But they were not guilty of the perfidious
                    behavior of which Reagan accused them.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I think that Washington over-reacted to the downing of KAL 007 and I thought that
                    the President was espousing his hard line for political reasons—not necessarily
                    supported by the facts, at least as I knew them. He exaggerated the Soviet
                    iniquity; I thought that that was unfortunate. Somewhat in contrast, the South
                    Koreans were not nearly as bombastic. They were never as concerned about the
                    Soviets as we were; they were much more paranoid about North Korea. I am sure
                    they were happy with the Reagan speech and they may well—behind the scenes in
                    Washington—have urged that the President give a speech of the sort he did. One
                    of the problems of being in an Embassy such as Seoul is that you are never
                    certain what is happening in Washington.</p>
                <p>I had early confirmation of my view of what happened by talking to the director
                    of intelligence at the command in Yongsan—a brigadier general. I had a long
                    conversation with him during which we reviewed all aspects of the incident and
                    he agreed that the exchange between the Soviet pilot and the ground controllers
                    was evidence that the shoot-down was a tragic accident and not a deliberate mass
                    murder. The Soviets didn't fully understand what they were doing; they also had
                    obviously been concerned by the presence of one of our “spy” planes which had
                    been spotted some hours earlier.</p>
                <p>Soon after the accident the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board
                    people came out. They were very careful in their analysis and very professional;
                    I was greatly impressed. I knew something about flying safety and procedures,
                    having served as an Air Force pilot. I thought that their findings as provided
                    us in their last briefing was right on the mark. They thought that the Korean
                    pilots of 007 had probably accidentally programmed a 10% error into their
                    computers before they left Anchorage and that despite the checks that were made
                    before flight, it was perfectly possible for the same mistake being repeated
                    three times during the three checks that a pilot goes through before take off.
                    It was clear that this scenario was most likely if one looked at the track of
                    the plane from Anchorage until it went down. The plane was continually 10% off
                    in its flight path before and after it left the Alaska Air Defense Zone and that
                    mistake was never corrected. I think that is what Seymour Hersch concluded in
                    his book on the subject, by the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Charlie Cho was the CEO of Korean Air Line and came under a lot of fire. Dixie
                    was close to him personally and knew what troubles Cho was going through. I
                    think KAL acted responsibly; it tried to get information out as soon as possible
                    and then to help the families as much as possible. It was clear that KAL had a
                    major problem on its hands; Cho was under tremendous political and public
                    pressure and condemnation. The downing of KAL 007 was a major tragedy,
                    especially in Korea. There were many rumors about why the plane had wandered off
                    course. One of the suppositions was that the airline or the pilot was just
                    trying to save fuel and took the more direct route which would have taken him
                    over Soviet territory. In fact, Cho had offered incentives to his pilots to try
                    to speed up their flights at reduced fuel consumption. That just added fuel to
                    the speculation that KAL was trying to “cut corners.” I think that was a cynical
                    Korean view of fellow Koreans, which horrified us to some extent. Because there
                    were some Americans on board, we had to pursue this issue for several months
                    after the incident, but that was not a major problem for us.</p>
                <p>While on the subject of tragedies, let me talk a little about the Burma
                    assassinations. The North Koreans perpetrated a terrorist attack on a Korean
                    official delegation, headed by Chun Doo Hwan. It took place at a major Burmese
                    shrine—pillars, domes, etc. The explosion collapsed the roof killing 16 members
                    of the Korean delegation, including the Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk and Kim Jae
                    Ik, the senior economic expert in the Korean government, Han Byung Chun, the
                    former Korean Ambassador to the US, and the Trade Minister. We knew most of the
                    deceased and some were very close friends of the Embassy and had been for many
                    years. Chun Doo Hwan, the presumptive target, was late in arriving for the
                    ceremony at the shrine and therefore was never in danger.</p>
                <p>The first thing that had to be done was to figure who was the perpetrator and
                    capture him if possible. We assumed that it was the North Koreans because the
                    target surely was Chun Doo Hwan. I think we put all the troops on the DMZ on
                    alert because we didn't know what the North Korean follow-up actions might be.
                    In fact, there was not any change in North Korean military posture. What was
                    interesting was the exchanges about the terrorists—two of whom had been captured
                    by the Burmese. As I recall, we in Seoul had a lot of exchanges with Charlie
                    Salmon, then our Charge' in Rangoon. One of the captured terrorists had a
                    grenade and had tried to blow himself up. Finally, the Burmese got confessions
                    from these two terrorists. Dixie did a wonderful job during this period; he paid
                    his respects to all of the families of the assassinated Koreans. He spent a lot
                    of time with them and I think, in light of Korean culture, this was a
                    tremendously important gesture which was warmly appreciated not only by the
                    families but by the Koreans generally.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I was horrified by the North Korean action. It was a terrible heinous deed. It
                    was such a clumsy effort to try to over-throw Chun Doo Hwan. I think they
                    expected to destabilize the South through their efforts and perhaps bring to
                    power a regime more to their liking. I don't remember that tensions had risen in
                    the previous few weeks or months, but I think it was probably more an
                    opportunity to take a crack at Chun Doo Hwan because he didn't travel outside of
                    Korea very much. Burma was a country which was accessible to North Koreans and
                    where security was not as strict as it was in other countries. It was an
                    incredible act which reinforced my view that the North Koreans regime was brutal
                    and cruel. In fact, the attempt on his life gave Chun some sympathy from his
                    people that he would not have gotten otherwise. Unfortunately, as I remember,
                    Chun came back and gave a speech in which he gloried in the fact that he was
                    still alive and that therefore all was well for his country. I think that
                    seriously dampened the sympathy that might have lasted longer had he not opened
                    his mouth; the speech made it clear that he was primarily concerned about
                    himself and only secondarily about his government's officials who had given
                    their lives in the service of their country. I suspect that Gun's tears when he
                    had coffee with me at the Nadja Hotel—an incident I have described
                    earlier—stemmed from the characteristic showed by Chun's reaction to the Burma
                    incident. Chun was an egomaniac and a terrible human being besides. He deserves
                    his current address—jail.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I think the 1982-85 period was one when we pursued our fundamental
                    objectives of stability on the Peninsula and the maintenance of good
                    relationships with the South Korean government with moderate success.</p>
                <p>1) First of all, peace was maintained.</p>
                <p>2) We served to a limited degree the cause of human rights, although probably not
                    as vigorously as any of us would have liked. The Chun Doo Hwan regime was not a
                    plus for Korea in this respect. There was obviously a growing desire among
                    Koreans for more political participation, but it was repressed by the regime. As
                    I said, it was not clear what the US could have done to accelerate political
                    growth; it was a Korean issue that had to be resolved by the Koreans themselves,
                    which I think by now they have done.</p>
                <p>3) The political cooperation between the two countries was quite satisfactory.
                    For example, semi-annual talks between the Department's Policy Planning Staff
                    and its Korean counterpart started during this period. There were also meetings
                    between representatives of other sectors of American and Korean society.
                    Parliamentarians visited back and forth. We had some academic exchanges and
                    meetings. There were meetings between businessmen, journalists, etc. There
                    weren't as many such meetings as there are today because Korea was not as
                    significant a power as it is today. But even in the 1980s, I went to conferences
                    in Aspen and Washington on security and other issues on the Peninsula. Then of
                    course there were the annual meetings of the Korean Defense Minister and the
                    Secretary of Defense. Korea has always been a pet subject for warriors. I am not
                    sure these confabs produced many concrete results, but they did stimulate
                    thinking and kept Korea in the forefront of top US policy makers.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>4) We served our interests beyond the Peninsula during this time. We were always
                    aware of Northeast Asia regional security concerns. Whenever I went through
                    Tokyo, I would take some time to discuss Northeast Asia issues with my
                    colleagues in the Embassy. There was considerable exchange of views among our
                    embassies in Northeast Asia and even in Southeast Asia. These were a plus.</p>
                <p>5) The economic relationship, in which we pursued diligently the opening of the
                    Korean markets, as we are still doing today, was conducted in our mutual
                    interest. In general, I think both the political and economic US-Korean
                    relationships progressed during this period, providing a base for both economic
                    and political growth in South Korea. We added to the base for the progress that
                    took place subsequently and which I think will continue to take place.</p>
                <p>For me personally, my tour as DCM was the most fulfilling and rewarding
                    assignment of my Foreign Service career, even including my two subsequent tours
                    as ambassador. As I think all of us who have served in Korea have noticed, if
                    things seemed quiet in the morning, you could be sure it would not last for a
                    whole day. It was always a five ring circus: political issues—stability and
                    human rights—, economic, consular as well as security were a constant. In
                    addition, there were two other matters that kept us engaged. One, which had been
                    a thorn in our sides for many years, was the need to obtain a new Chancery. When
                    there was nothing else to keep me occupied, I could always tackle the building
                    issue. I could always find a new angle to work on, as is still true today. We
                    still have not built a Chancery and are still occupying a ROK building that
                    according to written agreement we should have returned to the Korean government
                    certainly by the end of 1970s.</p>
                <p>Then there were always administrative problems of all sorts that could take up my
                    time. I enjoyed administrative challenges. I used to meet once a week with Jerry
                    Mandersheid, the Administrative Counselor, to see what was on his mind. For
                    example, some of our houses had asbestos in them. We worked out what to do about
                    that—remove it! Then one time we had one American employee who tried to kill
                    another. We had a man who molested his daughter. There was never any lack of
                    administrative problems. So Seoul was never quiet. If it wasn't some substantive
                    issue, then there were many others to keep me busy. Not only was I busy all the
                    time, but I learned all the time, so this was a period of personal growth. Being
                    an Ambassador in New Zealand was not nearly as challenging nor as active as
                    being the DCM in Korea. I certainly preferred to be the Number 2 in Seoul than
                    being the Number 1 in Wellington, although the perks that go with an
                    ambassadorial post as well as the credit that is given you are better than those
                    of a DCM. But from a work stand point, Seoul was more fulfilling. I suppose in
                    the end though it was due to the fact that there was a great difference in the
                    importance of Seoul to US Interests. If things went awry in Korea, that could
                    have major consequences. I was not especially consciously cognizant of the
                    consequences of our actions while in Korea, but in retrospect I have become
                    aware of this fact.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1986, you were appointed as Ambassador to New Zealand.
                        How did that occur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Dixie Walker, I believe, was the catalyst. He did not have an overly
                    enthusiastic view of the incumbent Ambassador—Monroe Browne—who was very, very
                    conservative. I think that Monroe Browne probably tried his best, but he may in
                    some part have aggravated some of the problems we had with New Zealand at the
                    time. Dixie had met Browne at some of the Chiefs of Mission conferences and used
                    to return muttering that if anyone thought that he, Dixie, was conservative,
                    they had not heard of Monroe Browne. Browne had been in Wellington for three
                    years and it was time for him to leave, even though he was very reluctant to
                    leave. In the final analysis, I think I was chosen as a replacement because I
                    was a professional Foreign Service officer and the US needed someone experienced
                    to handle a growing political problem revolving around the question of keeping
                    New Zealand nuclear free and the visits of US ships. That issue had gotten out
                    of hand and I think the administration felt that a professional was required to
                    deal with it...or to be seen dealing with it. In fact, I think I was the first
                    Foreign Service officer to be appointed Ambassador to New Zealand since the late
                    1940s, and there weren't many before that. I left Seoul at the beginning of
                    November, 1985 and arrived in Wellington on January 8, 1986. The processing and
                    confirmation of my appointment was unusually rapid. I had no problems with the
                    Senate or any other part of the process. Monroe Browne was not a happy man; he
                    came to Washington but refused to see me for a while. He finally “granted me an
                    interview” during which he stared at the opposite wall throughout our
                    conversation. This meeting took place in his suite in the Madison Hotel. There
                    was no question that he was hurt by his recall and may also have resented being
                    replaced by a Foreign Service officer. He had not been offered another mission;
                    in fact, he told me that he had had greater ambitions than being Ambassador to
                    New Zealand—he originally (in 1982) was shooting for Japan or China. Since he
                    did not get either of those posts, he had hoped to use Wellington as a podium to
                    comment on issues that touched on the whole of East Asia and hopefully to
                    influence US policy in that region of the world.</p>
                <p>While in Washington, I was briefed on the nuclear ship issue. I was told that the
                    New Zealand Labor Party, then the governing party, had decided on strictures
                    that made it impossible for us to bring our Navy vessels into New Zealand ports.
                    The Party had said—and was in the process of translating into specific
                    legislation when I arrived—that the Prime Minister had to decide whether there
                    were nuclear weapons on board any vessel docking or sailing in New Zealand
                    waters. We had determined on the other hand that we could not answer any
                    questions concerning our armaments as a matter of national security. We had for
                    a long time taken the position that we would not confirm or deny the presence of
                    nuclear weapons on any of our ships. And we could not have a Prime Minister
                    doing that for us. When we refused to divulge that information in 1985 at the
                    time of the visit of the destroyer Buchanan, the government turned us down.
                    Later, we informed the New Zealanders that if they insisted on putting the Labor
                    Party policies into law, it would present us with a serious dilemma. Under those
                    circumstances, if we decided to bring a ship into New Zealand waters, we would
                    either act contrary to our own policy or New Zealand law. We would could not do
                    either. That would leave us with only one answer and that would be to avoid New
                    Zealand waters entirely. That in turn meant suspending our defense
                    commitment.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State, George Shultz, was upset with the New Zealanders as was the
                    whole Department. DoD was upset. In fact, I think the Washington view was almost
                    unanimous both in the Executive and the Legislative branches. Congressman Steve
                    Solarz, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on East Asia, was
                    certainly unhappy with the New Zealanders as were most members of Congress. I
                    think Washington felt that the New Zealanders were just going too far. Not
                    bringing our ships to New Zealand was probably not a military problem; we were
                    much more concerned with the precedent that the New Zealanders were
                    establishing. That point had been made repeatedly to the New Zealanders; our
                    real concern was with Japan where our security position in East Asia could be
                    seriously damaged if that country were made to follow the New Zealand lead.
                    Beyond that region, the same issue had arisen in Denmark—in fact, later on after
                    I arrived, it was a very close call there and Denmark almost followed New
                    Zealand.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Shultz told me personally before I went to Wellington that he had talked to Prime
                    Minister Lange about the Labor Party policy; he thought that Lange had not lived
                    up to his promise to avoid confrontation over nuclear ships. Wolfowitz, the
                    Assistant Secretary for EA, told me specifically that Lange had promised Shultz
                    that he would do his best to convince his fellow Labor Party members to accept a
                    nuclear ship visit policy that we could live with. Lange, as far as we knew, had
                    not done anything along those lines. He had gone to the Tokalu Islands at the
                    time the critical decisions were being made by his Party regarding the Buchanan,
                    and upon his return he accepted the decisions made by the Party, which had been
                    propelled primarily by the left-wing members of the Party.</p>
                <p>My instructions were essentially to try to do the best I could to calm the
                    passions while at the same time making it clear to the New Zealanders that we
                    would not change our policy and that if they persisted in putting the Labor
                    Party policy into legislation, then we would be forced to suspend our defense
                    commitments as spelled out in the ANZUS treaty. If we could not make visits to
                    New Zealand ports and could not navigate their waters, we could not then fulfill
                    our commitments under any defense arrangements. As Congressman Solarz said: “We
                    can't get the stuff there in jeeps!” I did try in my first six months to
                    convince them not to pass the legislation, which had been drafted in damaging
                    terms, but it was a vain attempt, as Shultz had predicted to me it would be.</p>
                <p>Why did this happen? I think some New Zealanders—particularly the ideologues—had
                    become quite uncomfortable with the ANZUS alliance. New Zealand had more than
                    its share of pacifists and military alliances were just not philosophically
                    acceptable. Then there was the general nervousness about nuclear weapons.
                    Thirdly, there was a hangover of Vietnam resentment. Finally, I think many, if
                    not most, New Zealanders saw no threat to their national survival in the world
                    of the mid-1980s. In fact, many did not really see any military threat in the
                    world and felt that the US had hyped the Cold War. Many had forgotten WWII when
                    without us they could have easily become a Japanese colony. So there were a
                    number of reasons expressed, both singly and together, which led many New
                    Zealanders to see the world through a prism entirely different from ours and
                    most of the rest of the world. It was quite clear that a majority of New
                    Zealanders did not want our ships in their ports.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>On the other hand, roughly 66% of New Zealanders wanted to maintain in the ANZUS
                    alliance. In fact, they were never able to resolve the conflict between
                    belonging to an alliance and not abiding by its provisions or at least taking
                    unilateral actions that were detrimental to that alliance. I believe that it was
                    the philosophical view of the left wing members of the Labor Part that drove the
                    debate. At the same time, there were domestic political requirements, such as
                    the necessity for economic reforms, which contributed to the decision that New
                    Zealand took on the nuclear ships. I always felt—although none of the
                    participants would ever admit this directly—that essentially the right wing of
                    the Labor Party, whom one might expect would be more concerned about maintaining
                    ANZUS, was actually neutralized by the promise it received from the left wing
                    that economic reform, as outlined by the right wing, could proceed. That reform
                    called for a fairly sharp turn towards free enterprise and a market economy for
                    New Zealand. Left wing Labor leader Helen Clark confirmed the trade-off in
                    conversations with me in 1996. The left wing would not stand in the way of
                    economic reform as supported by the right wing in exchange for the right wing's
                    acquiescence to the left wing nuclear ship visit policy. Whether or not there
                    was an explicit deal, I don't know for certain—I doubt it was put in writing—but
                    that is what actually happened. The speculation that such a deal had been made
                    became almost conventional wisdom in New Zealand. It is entirely true that New
                    Zealand turned from being one of the most centrally controlled economies in the
                    free world—functioning about as well as the Soviet economy—into an almost
                    unimaginable free market economy, which has become an incredible success.</p>
                <p>I should note that a couple of wives of our officers sympathized with the New
                    Zealanders. I believe that the American staff itself, basically supported the US
                    view and positions. We had considerable discussion within the Embassy on the
                    nuclear war ship issue and I never heard otherwise. In light of that debate, we
                    changed our rhetoric somewhat after I arrived. In our statement of goals and
                    objectives, we moved the objective of “promoting the best possible relations
                    with New Zealand” from first to second place. The first objective became support
                    to the maximum extent of US security interests, including specifically
                    insistence on the US Navy's “neither confirm nor deny” policy. I don't recall
                    that we had any fundamental internal controversy; as I said, I think the staff
                    was in full support of our efforts.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>When I arrived in New Zealand in January 1986, even after hearing Shultz'
                    prediction, I was hopeful that I could reason with the New Zealanders. I didn't
                    know whether I could turn them around, but as the new boy on the block, I
                    certainly had some hopes of having some positive effect on the situation. I had
                    the highest respect for Secretary Shultz and knew that he was a very good judge
                    of situations. So my optimism was certainly tinged with reality. The first
                    question that I had to address was what I would say about the warship issue;
                    would I just mouth the usual line or should and could I put a little more
                    positive spin to our position. I concluded that neither of those tactics would
                    be at all useful. So, after getting off the plane, I answered the expected press
                    queries by saying that I had just arrived and that I first had to listen to the
                    views of the New Zealanders before expressing my views on the situation. I
                    promised that after having learned all I could, I would then comment. I think
                    that approach was well received and bought me some time. But that is all.</p>
                <p>As things developed, the New Zealanders passed the highly restrictive legislation
                    in December, 1986. We never formally withdrew from of ANZUS. To do so, would
                    have created more problems for us: 1) we would have difficulties coming to new
                    bilateral arrangements with Australia—the atmosphere was much different in the
                    late 1980s than it had been in the 1950s when ANZUS was formed; and 2) it would
                    have shut the door for New Zealand to reenter an alliance. By keeping ANZUS
                    going—even in an emasculated form—it left open the possibility for a reemergence
                    of the alliance without further negotiations. We were hopeful that New Zealand
                    would eventually revoke the legislation it had passed and rejoin the alliance.
                    So six months after I arrived, we just suspended our defense commitment to New
                    Zealand.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Washington for consultations in June, 1986, I expressed the
                    view that New Zealand should not be booted out of ANZUS and opposed suspending
                    the defense commitment until New Zealand first took actions that would justify
                    some reaction on our part. I wanted to keep the monkey on New Zealand's back.
                    But I didn't consider my point to be critical, so that when Shultz took a
                    different tack in Manila a few weeks later, it didn't upset me particularly.
                    After Shultz had a bilateral meeting with Lange in Manila, after the ASEAN
                    meeting, he talked to the press and much to Lange's surprise, said that the US
                    remained friends with New Zealand, but no longer allies. Under the
                    circumstances, the US could not continue its defense commitment to that country.
                    I was not in that meeting, although I had requested Washington approval for me
                    to go to Manila, but the Department felt that the precedent of only US
                    ambassadors to ASEAN countries attending should be maintained.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>I think Lange did not expect Shultz to suspend the defense commitment at that
                    time. In fact, it is my understanding that there was no discussion of such
                    action in the private Shultz-Lange meeting. So not only did the decision catch
                    Lange by surprise, but he was also surprised by the public announcement. In
                    fact, there is some controversy about the accuracy of the memcon of that meeting
                    on another issue as well. The US version had Shultz saying that Lange should
                    recognize that an American warship might well enter a New Zealand harbor at some
                    point carrying nuclear weapons. The Shultz statement was conditional; i.e. it
                    “might” happen. He didn't state categorically that it would happen; Shultz just
                    conjectured that it might happen. The New Zealand record indicated that Shultz
                    stated that the US would definitely send such a ship. New Zealand's Secretary
                    for Foreign Affairs, Merv Norrish, who did participate in the meeting, was
                    absolutely sure that the New Zealand record was correct; he was certain that
                    Shultz had said that New Zealand had to face the fact that sooner or later the
                    US would send a warship with nuclear weapons aboard into a New Zealand port.
                    That phraseology was just unacceptable to Lange. Lange later in Bangkok publicly
                    blasted the Secretary for his comments. I believe that in fact the difference in
                    the records was not crucial. I think any mention of nuclear-armed warships in
                    New Zealand ports was just unacceptable. I don't think that whatever Shultz said
                    made any difference to the policy positions of either country. It only became an
                    issue because Lange let fly a broadside against the Secretary and US policy. He
                    tried to place blame for any damage to US-New Zealand relations on Shultz'
                    back.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I would say that we were right in doing what we did. We really
                    didn't have any options because of the precedent problem. After all the Chinese
                    were letting our ships dock in their ports without questions being asked. The
                    Indians were doing the same thing. I was disgusted when Rajiv Gandhi later came
                    to Wellington, embraced Prime Minister Lange and said that the Indians admired
                    the New Zealand's nuclear policy. It was disingenuous at best because while
                    praising Lange's policy, the Indians were allowing our ships into their ports
                    without asking questions. What hypocrisy! So I think we were right and we never
                    tried to soft-pedal our stand. Even Lange admitted that Shultz had been quite
                    clear all along about our position. We gave the New Zealanders lots of warnings
                    about the consequences of their policy and did exactly what we said we would
                    do.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>If I have a reservation about our actions it is that at the beginning of the
                    debate we might have made a greater effort to convince them of the desirability
                    of maintaining an alliance, which required the docking of warships in New
                    Zealand harbors without questions asked, we might then have averted the rupture
                    of the military alliance. We also were not helped when we were essentially
                    forced by Prime Minister Muldoon to bring the destroyer Truxton, to New Zealand
                    in the early 1980s. He in effect ordered us to bring that ship into New Zealand
                    as a show of contempt for the”peaceniks”. We brought the ship into Auckland,
                    although we had serious reservations about the wisdom of doing so. Of course,
                    the appearance of that ship brought a major outcry in the country, which became
                    a major catalyst for the political success of the Labor Party and the eventual
                    election of Lange. It is not entirely fair to look in retrospect with 20/20
                    hindsight, but I do believe that a more attentive policy vis-a-vis New Zealand
                    might have averted the later rupture.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless I think our policy was correct; it was not directed towards New
                    Zealand; it was a global policy intended to bolster our security. We would just
                    not “confirm or deny” whether nuclear weapons were aboard a naval vessel. No
                    other country in the world has ever raised the issue the way the New Zealanders
                    did and that gave us very few options.</p>
                <p>Lange was not the easiest guy to get along with and furthermore, he had his
                    domestic constituency to worry about. We never trusted him. He was brilliant,
                    but as a lawyer, it was said of him that he would perform at peak efficiency if
                    he could figure out the case in the five minutes it took him to walk down the
                    corridor to the court room. You could not expect Lange to give an issue any
                    sustained and prolonged review. He had “attention deficit disorder.”</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Another description of him came from Sir Robert Muldoon, the previous Prime
                    Minister and Lange's arch rival. Both were quite plump. When I asked Muldoon
                    what he thought of Lange, he said that “Lange was a fat boy at the age of three,
                    unloved by his mother, who developed his wit as a defense, but never developed
                    anything to defend.” I think that was a brutal but probably accurate description
                    of the man. Lange did not have any core principles which were sustained over any
                    length of time. He had a squishy love of the poor and the downtrodden, which is
                    commendable, but it was not clear that this was a fundamental principle with
                    him. Many liked him, but very few trusted him, especially those who had to deal
                    with him. I used to go see him quite often; I always felt that diplomats must
                    get out of their offices and talk to the leaders as well as the people to the
                    country to which they were accredited. As time went on and as the nuclear issue
                    receded, I would go to see Lange to chat to him about New Zealand politics and
                    his views about world events. I would then report his views to Washington. Lange
                    and I got along alright; he was always funny and pleasant to me. I wouldn't say
                    we were friends, but we got along and our meetings were pleasant enough. He
                    didn't hold me personally responsible for US policy. In a book he wrote after he
                    ended his Prime Ministership, he did berate my predecessor at some length. He
                    mentioned me in a sentence or two, as Monroe's successor. He did say I was a
                    “harder case”; to this day, I don't know what that meant. Nothing good, I
                    suspect.As a matter of fact, I don't remember being berated by any of the Labor
                    Cabinet officers, except for Mike Moore, who was one of my favorite Cabinet
                    officers. He was the Trade Negotiator and he periodically took me to task for US
                    trade positions and policies. I was never personally attacked by anyone in New
                    Zealand during my tour, even though US-New Zealand relations had seen better
                    days. In fact, the damage to US-New Zealand relations had already taken place by
                    the time I arrived. The last ditch effort I made to try to get the law revised
                    was in vain; so I turned my attention to the future. I made every effort to
                    present the US as a reasonable friend in the hopes that I could calm the waters.
                    I readily admitted that we couldn't change our policy for New Zealand—on
                    disclosure of what our warships were carrying—because of the precedent it would
                    establish—but I emphasized wherever I went that there were many positive aspects
                    to our relationship. I think that this approach, after three years, had some
                    effect on stopping the deterioration of the relations. I don't remember that
                    either I or the US was ever attacked in personal or venal ways; we were severely
                    criticized for our policies by some ideologues periodically, but it was mostly
                    done in an unoffensive way. Sometimes we would be mentioned for our racial
                    problems; we would be derided occasionally. I think that these criticisms
                    stemmed probably from the New Zealand hurt and anger about the suspension of
                    defense commitments. We did have a couple of tiny demonstrations in front of the
                    Embassy by opponents of our nuclear policy. When I made my first speech, three
                    months after my arrival, to the New Zealand Foreign Policy Association—a
                    preeminent group in Wellington—there were demonstrations which forced me to
                    enter the building through the back door. Some of the demonstrators filtered
                    into the building and began to shout. The moderator told them that if they
                    wanted to participate, they would have to join the association. Some paid the
                    dues and then heckled me from the back row. But that was the exception. I really
                    received very little public condemnation.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I talked about our cooperation in Antarctica and the benefits of trade between
                    our two countries; I emphasized the positives whenever I could. There is always
                    some dissatisfaction about trade. The discussions sometimes get pretty heated;
                    in Australia, some farmers dumped a couple of truckloads of wheat on our
                    Ambassador's lawn; that never happened to me. We did receive some criticism on
                    our dairy support policies, meat quotas and restrictions. But I don't think we
                    were subjected to any more criticism in New Zealand than we were in other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Nor do I think our commercial relationships changed much during my tour. There
                    was some concern, especially in the New Zealand business community, that the
                    nuclear ship issue might have some adverse effect on trade. I think Shultz and
                    others as well as I, tried to make it clear all along that we would not mix
                    economics and politics. We would not invoke sanctions because of the nuclear
                    ship policy. When the New Zealanders finally enacted their restrictive
                    legislation, we did stop dialogue at high political levels on political and
                    security matters and suspended our defense commitments, but we did not suspend
                    high level meetings on trade issues. We took no trade retaliatory measures;
                    there were no non-tariff barrier actions taken, such as anti-dumping suits which
                    might have been interpreted by some as mere retaliation for the New Zealand's
                    nuclear stand. In fact, trade between New Zealand and the US grew steadily in
                    the three year period I served in Wellington.</p>
                <p>As we had for some time, we did impose some restraint (VRA) on meat imports as we
                    did with Australia. But these actions preceded the nuclear issue and therefore
                    could not have been viewed as a retaliatory measure. We also imposed some
                    restraints on dairy imports. None of these trade issues became much of a
                    political issue for us; in part because they were an old story and in part
                    because most of the restraints came as part of negotiations which took place in
                    Geneva where most of the trade issues were being handled. This is not to say
                    that we were not given a stream of complaints by the New Zealand Ministry for
                    Trade or Foreign Ministry or Agriculture Ministry, which we duly reported, but
                    it never was the cause for any political problems. The farmers were undoubtedly
                    unhappy about our policies, but in general, I think the new Zealanders accepted
                    them without rancor. I went on many trips to the countryside and found almost a
                    universal pro-American feeling. Trade with the US was not a particularly large
                    part of the New Zealand economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>I did not spend as much time as I might have on commercial issues. There was no
                    question that a change of emphasis in our relations was underway as it was
                    elsewhere at the end of the Cold War. That is, we were moving from security
                    concerns to commercial matters. In retrospect, I probably should have been more
                    active in the commercial area, particularly since I was not making any headway
                    on security issues. That is not to say that I neglected the commercial side; I
                    did do a lot of work in that area. We moved the Commercial Office from
                    Wellington to Auckland, which was the commercial center of New Zealand. I kept
                    one New Zealander in the Embassy to handle commercial matters in Wellington, but
                    our principal focus became Auckland. I spent a fair amount of time speaking to
                    Chambers of Commerce, seeing businessmen from both countries, drumming up US-New
                    Zealand trade. I was sure that there was room for trade growth and we did work
                    on that. As I said, the late 1980s was the beginning of the change of US
                    emphasis from security issues to commercial ones around the world. It was also
                    useful for me to work on commercial issues in New Zealand because that was a
                    positive aspect of our relationship which is what I wanted to emphasize rather
                    than the nuclear ship issue.</p>
                <p>As far as I could tell, all the opposition to US policies was domestically grown;
                    I don't think there were any foreign influences at work. There was a certain
                    amount of competition between the Soviet Ambassador and myself; we did appear on
                    TV and other forums sequentially to discuss the Cold War issues of the day. I
                    did not have a head-to-head debate with him because I think that would have been
                    a poor idea. My whole effort in the three years in New Zealand was to calm the
                    waters; I certainly was not interested in stirring up controversies even if they
                    were not directly related to New Zealand. Some New Zealanders may have played up
                    the “Super Power” differences, but it was not in our interest to do so in that
                    country. I got along with the Soviet Ambassadors increasingly well because
                    glasnost was well under way and they were becoming more and more open with me. I
                    enjoyed talking to both Soviet Ambassadors, who spoke excellent English. But as
                    I have said, my main objective was to calm the waters.</p>
                <p>While in Wellington I sent three speeches back to the Department which saw fit to
                    publish them in its “Bulletin”. In each I tried to be clear on our positions,
                    without increasing the heat of the debate. The three speeches showed the
                    progression in our relations.</p>
                <p>While I was Ambassador, there were a number of attempts made in Washington to be
                    “tougher” on the New Zealanders than I thought warranted. There may well have
                    been some people who wanted to invoke economic sanctions, for example, but
                    Shultz took that issue off the table almost from the beginning of our
                    controversy with the New Zealanders. But there was an effort made to close our
                    post in Auckland. That got me into a serious disagreement with Washington. I
                    think that these ideas came from the Director of the Office for Australia-New
                    Zealand Affairs, John Glassman, probably supported by Jim Lilley, the EA Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>One day, I received a questionnaire about closing the Consulate General in
                    Auckland. I almost immediately responded with a strong negative answer. The post
                    had existed for 130 years, I said, it was a busy place for both commercial and
                    consular work. To close the post would only mean moving all the functions to
                    Wellington because they could not be eliminated. We would be far more
                    inconvenienced ourselves than would be the New Zealanders. In any case, I
                    thought that it would be a poor political decision because it would be perceived
                    as an anti new Zealand act, regardless how we might paint it. It would just give
                    the Labor Party extremists further fuel for their fire; we would be painted as a
                    “big bully” without gaining any benefit.</p>
                <p>Then came another questionnaire, which seemed rather odd to me. It was more
                    detailed than the first one. We filled it out and submitted it again indicating
                    our strong opposition to the closing of the post. I am not sure what happened
                    next, but I do remember that on one of my trips back to Washington for
                    consultations, I was sitting in Mike Armacost's office—he was then the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs. In the middle of our conversation about New
                    Zealand matters, he asked me whether I really wanted to close Auckland. I was
                    stunned. My reply was not only “No”, but “Hell, no!” I told Mike that I had made
                    it as clear as I could in my messages that I strongly objected to the proposal.
                    Mike didn't say anything for a few moments and then said that he had not
                    understood that that was my position. The Director for Australia-New Zealand
                    affairs—Glassman—was in the meeting and said absolutely nothing. I never
                    discussed that exchange with him subsequently. I should have. But is was clear
                    to me that my position had been perverted by the EA Bureau in some report to
                    Armacost. I don't know how else Mike would have gotten the idea that I wanted to
                    close Auckland. As far as I know, the post closing idea did not stem from
                    budgetary pressures; those were the days when the Department could still operate
                    at a relatively effective level. So I assume that the rationale for closing
                    Auckland was strictly political—retribution for a New Zealand policy which we
                    found abhorrent. In the final analysis, the post was not closed, which was
                    obviously the sensible decision.</p>
                <p>But I must say that this episode made me more leery than ever of the support I
                    was receiving from Glassman. I think he was a supporter, if not instigator, of a
                    very hard line policy toward New Zealand. My view was that we had pushed New
                    Zealand as hard as seemed profitable; I saw no reason to continue the pounding.
                    It wasn't going to change the New Zealand position on nuclear warships. We
                    weren't going to change ours—and rightly so—but I thought the time had come to
                    agree to disagree and let it go at that. No further recriminations were in
                    order, nor would they have accomplished anything positive. I always had the
                    feeling that Glassman wanted to punish the New Zealanders; that seemed to me to
                    be a misguided policy. Any negative action we might take would only have played
                    into the hands of the Labor Party's left wing which would have used any excuse
                    to berate the United States as the “big bully.” The left did berate us whenever
                    it could, but without any major US action, its position did not resonate through
                    the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Otherwise, I think I received good backstopping from Washington. After having
                    been in Wellington for a few months and after the New Zealanders passed the
                    legislation that we wanted stopped or amended, I lobbied Washington to develop a
                    public relations campaign. I wanted as many top level Americans as could be
                    found. I wanted them to speak in New Zealand about US policies towards East
                    Asia. People who had sufficient credibility to explain our actions and views.
                    For example, Harry Harding—an outstanding China scholar—came out, Jonathan
                    Pollard from Rand came. We tried to get American participants to foreign policy
                    conferences held in New Zealand. It was a stepped up effort that I really
                    pushed. The Department supported us in this effort.</p>
                <p>We did have one unfortunate development, however, as part of this effort. I
                    wanted an authoritative American to come to explain our policy about reducing
                    nuclear weapons around the world, which the Reagan administration had pushed
                    publicly. I wanted to combat the propaganda that some New Zealanders were
                    spreading to the effect that we were the monster that was driving the nuclear
                    arms race. I thought that some education about our position and our actions was
                    in order. We finally managed to get the head of ACDA to agree to come. But at
                    the last minute, we got a message indicating that he had cancelled the trip. I
                    was dismayed. I found out later that the reason for the cancellation was because
                    during one of the Secretary's staff meetings, our ACDA Chief had mentioned that
                    he was planning to go to New Zealand and Australia and he would be discussing
                    our efforts on arms limitations in Auckland. The Secretary immediately told him
                    to cancel his stop in Auckland; he didn't want anyone at that level to go to New
                    Zealand to discuss nuclear weapons issues. It was his policy that senior
                    officers of the US government were not to talk about nuclear and security issues
                    in New Zealand. That view was consistent with Shultz' long held policy that we
                    would not conduct any kind of public dialogue on security issues with New
                    Zealand by anyone above the assistant secretary level. But I think it was a self
                    defeating decision.</p>
                <p>Most of the UN issues were handled in New York. The Embassy may have been engaged
                    on a couple of occasions, but New York was the focal points for discussions of
                    UN issues.</p>
                <p>I would not wish to leave the impression that we in the Embassy were at odds with
                    Washington. I have mentioned the couple of occasions when we might have worked
                    at cross purposes, but those were rare instances. The policy that I was pursuing
                    in Wellington had been pretty well outlined to me and others by Shultz; so there
                    really wasn't any debate about our strategy in New Zealand. Whenever I returned
                    for consultations, once or twice each year, I would see Armacost. I think that
                    all substantial issues, of which there were very few, reached at least Armacost.
                    We never had any differences; we had known each other for many years. So I
                    cannot complain about the support I received from the Department; the Bureau
                    accommodated my request as best they could. My only reservation, as I have
                    already mentioned, was with Glassman.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>I also think that New Zealand was not very high on either the Assistant
                    Secretary's priority list nor the Under Secretary's. Once the ship issue was
                    resolved, no top level people spent time on the subject. That was alright with
                    me because I really didn't have any major issues on my plate that needed their
                    attention; my actions were basically ministerial, taken to implement a policy
                    that was well established. My major function was simply to explain to the New
                    Zealanders our positions, and I spoke frequently to audiences throughout the
                    country. I put the best possible spin on our position on nuclear warships; it
                    was important that we not be seen as a hard-nose bully who didn't really care
                    about anyone else except ourselves.</p>
                <p>The press was relatively objective. They of course had their differences on the
                    nuclear ship issue. The “Evening Post” in Wellington was pro-American; it had a
                    very conservative publisher and editor with whom I got along well. “The
                    Dominion” was somewhat less pro-American, but not provocative. The Auckland
                    “Herald” was pro-American; the Christchurch “Press” which was a very good paper,
                    was reasonably balanced. No newspaper was in the pockets of either of the
                    parties or any factions thereof. I spent as much time as I could with the media
                    because that was a good conduit for our message. I was interviewed many times; I
                    appeared on TV several times; I appeared on radio shows. One time, I went to a
                    small town and appeared on the local radio show. One elderly lady called in and
                    said: “What a nice man Ambassador Cleveland is.” That made my day! I was very
                    pleased with that reaction because it showed that we could project an image of a
                    decent country and people. My line was always that I understood the New
                    Zealanders' problem with nuclear warships and all I asked in return that they
                    recognize that the US also had a problem. As I said, I spoke as often as I
                    could; I had no shortage of invitations for which I was very thankful.</p>
                <p>Whenever I went into the countryside away from the major cities, where I knew we
                    had some sympathy because farmers are innately conservative and those people
                    were chafing under the economic reforms instituted by the government—it had
                    taken away all the agricultural subsidies. I would often start my speeches with
                    the line; “Friends, I want you to know that I have some good news and some bad
                    news. The bad news is that I am from the government and I am here to help you.”
                    (groans and hisses). “The good news is that I am not from your government.”
                    (loud cheers). I didn't always use that line because it obviously ran some risk
                    of displeasing the Labor government, even though Lange had a good sense of
                    humor, he did not like humor at his own expense. But I enjoyed using that line
                    whenever I could.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I should make it clear that I did not always try to be a nice guy. On the
                    Wellington waterfront, there was a small monument donated by the 2nd Marine
                    Division, which had come ashore during WW II between its engagements on
                    Guadalcanal and Tarawa—two very bloody battles. The division stayed in
                    Wellington for some length of time and left this monument which said: “From the
                    2nd Marine Division: We will always be here when you need us.” The monument got
                    knocked down one day by a truck—accidentally, I believe. It was rebuilt through
                    donations from the 2nd Marine Division veterans. We then planned a ceremony
                    which would be attended by a representative group from the Division. It was all
                    set for a Saturday morning. As I got into my car to drive to the ceremony, I
                    heard the following on the radio: “The Agricultural Minister, Colin Moyle, said
                    today on his return from Tehran that he didn't understand why there was such a
                    fuss about Iran. He found that country to be grand and as far as he could see,
                    was a democracy.” That blew my mind. At the monument, I found about thirty US
                    Second Division veterans and their wives, plus some senior New Zealand military
                    officers. So in my remarks at the rededication ceremony, I included a few unkind
                    words about that radio report. I deplored the thought that any senior
                    representative of a democratic government would go to Iran and declare it a
                    democracy. I found that unbelievable and offensive. I said I thought it was a
                    very sad day for true democracy. My comments got wide and immediate
                    dissemination through the media. I was delighted when Lange later chewed Moyle
                    out publically. It was obviously unacceptable for any member of the government
                    to make such remarks in light of the facts known to the whole world.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Antarctica earlier. By treaty, we had cooperative arrangements with
                    many countries that had some interest in that area of the world. Many countries
                    had made territorial claims on Antarctica, but without surrendering the rights
                    we claimed, we agreed not to pursue them. All the signatories agreed to free
                    passage on Antarctica to all peaceful traffic. The US itself has never claimed
                    any specific part of Antarctica, although we have at times suggested that we
                    could claim the whole area.</p>
                <p>We also had specific agreements with New Zealand because we used Christchurch as
                    the take off point for our planes that were resupplying our base in
                    Antarctica—McMurdo. We had a small resupply base in Christchurch. Those
                    arrangements had worked well for many years and continued while I was in new
                    Zealand. While planes carrying nuclear weapons were theoretically not allowed to
                    land in New Zealand without the PM's decision as to whether they carried Nukes,
                    there was never any prohibition on our flights for Antarctica; it was in every
                    one's interest to have that operation continue. Lange made it very clear that he
                    was not going to raise any questions about our air traffic in Christchurch. He
                    said that everyone knew that neither the US or anyone else would put nuclear
                    weapons in the “veggies”; i.e. the food stuff and scientific material we were
                    shipping to Antarctica. As far as he was concerned, that was the end of any
                    potential problems about using Christchurch as our resupply point. So we
                    continued to have full cooperation with the New Zealanders, sharing planes and
                    other operations. Their base was near ours in Antarctica, so that there was a
                    synergy which made cooperation very sensible.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>In short, our Antarctica arrangement was always a good one and continued without
                    problems—until one day when John Lehman, the Secretary of the Navy arrived. He
                    was a very conservative man, who does not stand very high in my esteem—didn't
                    then and doesn't now. Lehman came loaded for bear. There had been some
                    suggestions made in the past to move our antarctica supply base from
                    Christchurch to Tasmania. The Governor of Tasmania was very anxious to have that
                    happen because the Australians already had their supply base in Tasmania and he
                    thought it would be a dandy idea to have the Americans collocated there. But I
                    didn't think it was a very practical idea; in any case, we had had this long
                    standing arrangement with New Zealand that had worked well for many years and I
                    was strongly opposed to any such move.</p>
                <p>Sometime before the Lehman visit, Secretary Shultz had ruled out any move of the
                    re-supply base out of Christchurch; he did not want Antarctica—a scientific
                    endeavor—tied to a political issue like the nuclear warship visit one. But
                    Lehman came; he was determined that he would find some way to bypass the
                    Secretary of State and move the base. He wanted to punish the New Zealanders for
                    their position on “his” Navy's port visits.</p>
                <p>I flew to Christchurch to have breakfast with him. New Zealand's Secretary of
                    Defense Dennis McLean also came and we used his plane to fly to the South
                    island. I was told later that, after breakfast, Lehman sent a message back to
                    Washington reporting that he had had breakfast with McLean and Cleveland; he
                    said that the Secretary of Defense was easier to get along with than the
                    American Ambassador, which was probably true. I told Lehman loud and clear that
                    I was strongly opposed to moving the supply base out of New Zealand because it
                    was not consistent with our foreign policy and the explicit directions of the
                    Secretary of State. Lehman left Christchurch without saying anything about the
                    re-supply base, went to Antarctica and returned still saying nothing about the
                    re-supply base. Then he went on to Australia and Tasmania, where he had a
                    meeting with the Governor. After that session, he announced that the US would
                    consider moving the Christchurch operation to Tasmania. After my breakfast with
                    Lehman, I had issued special orders to the staff to alert me to anything that he
                    might say on his trip. So, within five minutes of Lehman's statement, I was
                    called and immediately issued a press statement which flatly contradicted
                    Lehman's comments—that had been drafted ahead of time as a contingency item. We
                    said that the Secretary of the Navy does not make foreign policy; that is the
                    responsibility of the Secretary of State who had already given assurances that
                    the Christchurch base would not be moved. Fortunately, this internal US squabble
                    only got page 6 coverage, saying that “US Ambassador refutes comments by US
                    Secretary of the Navy.” Fortunately it did not draw much attention in New
                    Zealand and that was the last we ever heard of moving the Christchurch base. By
                    giving it our immediate response, the story became a non-story, thereby denying
                    the left a new issue to batter the US. That enabled us to move on the path we
                    had set: get along with New Zealand and cool down the rhetoric that our
                    differences on nuclear warship visits had created.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I did visit Antarctica myself. The US Ambassador to New Zealand had some special
                    responsibilities for that area, although it was practically no work load
                    whatsoever. I was designated to sign on behalf of the US a protocol to the
                    Antarctica Treaty, that placed some tough environmental restrictions on
                    operations in Antarctica. Most of the other countries did not sign it; so that
                    the protocol was never promulgated.</p>
                <p>In general, I found a competent American staff in New Zealand. A post like
                    Wellington does not attract the cream of the crop, but I was satisfied with my
                    staff. The DCM when I arrived—Dick Teare—was a good officer; he was replaced by
                    Al LaPorta, who was was an exceptional manager and I felt very comfortable
                    having him run the Embassy on a day-to-day basis leaving me time to do the
                    public relations business and the high level contacts. In between those two, I
                    had a DCM for a short period of time—John Penfold. He was an economic officer; I
                    don't think he was very happy in Wellington, and he left after about a year to
                    go to Honduras. Most of the people from the other agencies were also quite
                    satisfactory. There were some minor problems, but they were very minor. We
                    didn't have any “stars”, but I think the staff was quite good. I was very
                    pleased when we were inspected—I think this was 1988. As a result, I got a
                    letter from the Secretary saying that Wellington was one of the five best posts
                    of one hundred or so that had been inspected that year. I already felt good
                    because the inspectors before leaving for their next post had told me informally
                    that morale in New Zealand was among the best they had ever seen. I credit that
                    to several factors: 1) I was the first professional Ambassador in many years and
                    I spent a lot of time walking around the Chancery talking to both American and
                    local employees. I think that was well received; 2) I used to go out with some
                    of the local employees to sporting events; that was also appreciated; and 3) the
                    substantive and rhetorical approach we took was effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>I should comment a little about New Zealanders' views of the world. They are
                    simultaneously global and provincial. New Zealand is a small country located at
                    the edge of the map. Just that situation alone explains why they viewed the
                    world differently than we did. An Australian historian once wrote about the
                    “tyranny of distance.” That meant that in the beginning, because they were
                    distant, Australia and New Zealand clung to England—the motherland. Neither
                    country developed its national identity until after WW II, when it became clear
                    that England could no longer protect the “colonies.” Both countries tried to
                    turn to the US but we were not psychologically inclined to play the “mother
                    protector” role that England had. So New Zealand was left to its own devices,
                    far away from the rest of the world. It then developed its own sense of
                    nationalism, which became the foundation for its independent policy on nuclear
                    weapons. New Zealand also wanted to be recognized at the same time as an
                    important global player. This posed a real dilemma for New Zealand. It wanted to
                    be important but it was “off the map.” One of their policy decisions which tried
                    to accommodate their situation was the “nuclear free zone” concept they
                    promoted. More broadly, New Zealand took a highly responsible global approach.
                    It sends more troops to support UN peace keeping operations than almost any
                    other country. It has observers as part of the Observer Force in the Sinai. It
                    sent troops to Somalia, Bosnia and many other places where peacekeeping was
                    required. So along with their provincial “nationalism,” New Zealanders have a
                    sense of global responsibility, rooted in a real sense of where they are
                    geographically. They will sacrifice for the maintenance of peace throughout the
                    world, in part on the assumption that if they need help at some time, the world
                    will repay them. I think that their policy on nuclear warships was an exception
                    to their general willingness to participate positively in world affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1989 you were assigned to Malaysia as our
                        Ambassador. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: I think I lucked out as in some ways I had with my Wellington
                    assignment. One day, Larry Eagleburger called me in Wellington to tell me that
                    the administration had selected a woman—a real estate person—from the State of
                    Washington to succeed me as Ambassador to New Zealand. He told me not to worry
                    however, because the Department's new policy was to find good assignments for
                    any career Ambassadors who had been replaced by a political appointee. In fact,
                    he mentioned that Malaysia might be available and asked me whether I would be
                    interested. I agreed and that is how I ended up in Kuala Lumpur. That new policy
                    I think was very helpful to me.</p>
                <p>The confirmation process took a little longer this time. I left Wellington
                    towards the end of April 1989 and I didn't get to Kuala Lumpur until October.
                    Most of the time was taken up with the clearance process and some briefings. The
                    confirmation hearings went smoothly and the Senate approval process was
                    accomplished expeditiously.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I had learned something about Malaysia when I served in Indonesia. I had visited
                    the country on a couple of occasions. So I had some familiarity with the
                    Indonesian-Malay culture in general. But that was the extent of my knowledge. In
                    fact, Malaysia was quite different from Indonesia.</p>
                <p>In Malaysia, there is a convergence of three cultures: Malay, Chinese and Indian.
                    The Chinese population in Malaysia is quite substantial whereas it was only 5%
                    in Indonesia. As a consequence, the Malays, in contrast to the Indonesians, are
                    less secure and feel more threatened by the Chinese. The Chinese in Malaysia are
                    intelligent, traditionally worked harder than the Malay and therefore did better
                    in school and in business. That was bound to effect the Malay view of the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>In 1969 there were major communal riots. In response to this perceived threat of
                    Chinese domination, the Malay had promulgated the largest affirmative action
                    program in the world. They had set up a system which made sure that Malays would
                    get their share—if not more—of the opportunities in academia, government, the
                    military and some of the financial centers—the key control spots. The Chinese
                    were left to take over the business community. The affirmative action had worked
                    extremely well over the years, without increasing the tension between the Malay
                    and Chinese communities. The Chinese, despite their losses in some key segments
                    of society, were left with enough of the “pie” to satisfy them. The success of
                    the affirmative action program was undoubtedly due to a rapidly expanding
                    economy, led by trade. As long as the “economic pie” was ever expanding, it
                    could accommodate the needs of the racial communities, even with their growing
                    populations. So the government could afford to discriminate against the Chinese
                    because everybody's economic well-being was improving. It was always said that
                    if the economy were to stagnate or, even worse, to deteriorate, then the tension
                    between the communities would undoubtedly rise again.</p>
                <p>The Indians were only 9% of the population. They were probably, as a whole, at
                    the bottom of society. Some Indians had some very highly respected professional
                    positions—lawyers, doctors, etc. But on the other hand, many of them were rubber
                    tappers and poor. Since the Indian portion of the population was relatively
                    small, they did not play a major role in Malaysian society. It was the
                    Malay-Chinese schism that drove politics in Malaysia. In practice, the
                    multi-racial society worked reasonably well because of the economic growth and
                    the affirmative action program promulgated by the government. I think it is
                    still working well.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>When I went to Malaysia, our relationship with that country was reasonably good.
                    The trade relations were good. The Malaysian had fewer trade restrictions—tariff
                    and non-tariff barriers—than almost any country in the Far East. We only had a
                    few complaints abut import restrictions—chocolate, chickens and some other
                    agricultural products. But by and large, we were satisfied with Malaysian trade
                    policies. In addition, Malaysia was quite open to foreign investment—quite
                    different than Korea, for example, which was highly restrictive on foreign
                    investment. Malaysians welcomed our technology and as a result became the third
                    largest exporter in the world of computer chips. American firms like Intel drove
                    this growth when they decided to build plants in Malaysia. Although the chips
                    were designed in the US, they were produced in Malaysia. So our economic
                    relations were quite satisfactory and my marching orders were to keep them
                    so.</p>
                <p>The biggest US investor was EXXON—known as ESSO in Malaysia. It had very large
                    oil fields that it was exploiting. ESSO also found major gas reserves which they
                    were bringing up. There were other US investments—e.g. Mattel—in Malaysia. It
                    became obvious to me after a few months in Kuala Lumpur that the trade and
                    investment aspects of the Malaysia-US relations was really the major area to
                    work on; the political side, which I will discuss later, was just not fertile
                    ground to plow. I began by vowing not to become a “salesman”, as the
                    Scandinavian ambassadors were for their fishing and timber products. “That was
                    not my bag,” I said. It didn't take me long however before I decided that I
                    indeed would become a “salesman” for American products. I had in the past spent
                    66%-70% of my time on political and security issues—as I had done in Korea. That
                    changed dramatically in Malaysia; in fact, I spent two-thirds of my time on
                    commercial matters—promoting US commercial interests in Malaysia. The Cold War
                    had passed. It was clear that our diplomatic focus around the world would have
                    to adjust to that fact and in Southeast Asia, it was the economic/commercial
                    interests that had to become the priority focus of my attention. Of course,
                    there were always political/security issues, but they were no longer the time
                    consumers that they had been. I should say that this change of emphasis was all
                    at my initiative; Washington hadn't caught up with the new environment in which
                    its Ambassadors in Southeast Asia were operating. I rewrote our “Goals and
                    Objectives” statement which was the fundamental operating guideline for my
                    Country Team. We used to have two staff meetings each week on a variety of
                    subjects; I changed one to focus entirely on commercial issues. I personally
                    spent more and more time with the Economic and Commercial Counselors—to the
                    chagrin of the Political Section. As time went on, I asked our political
                    analysts to write more and more about the connections between Malaysian
                    government and business, including for example the fact that the ruling party's
                    leadership was part of interlocking directorships that ran many business
                    enterprises. We tried to examine how Malaysian business was run, how it worked,
                    and how it related to the political leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>So we shifted the focus of the Embassy's work. I spent a lot of time with
                    American businessman. I saw every businessman who came to Kuala Lumpur who
                    wanted to see me. I spent a lot of time with the ABC (the American Business
                    Community—now known as the American Chamber of Commerce). When my tour ended,
                    the ABC gave me a commemorative plaque for my efforts on behalf of American
                    business in Malaysia as Honorary Chairman of the ABC board. It was clear that
                    the Embassy had dramatically changed from a time honored multi-purpose
                    organization into one which gave the highest priority to commercial work. We
                    pushed all the trade issues as much as we could. As I said, there weren't many
                    barriers but we pushed to eliminate the few that were standing. We worked
                    assiduously on that—every day in every way.</p>
                <p>One day I was in Singapore visiting Bob Orr, our Ambassador there. He had been
                    the Governor of Indiana, after a career in business. I thought he was a jewel.
                    We were having breakfast on the back porch of his residence. I said: “Bob, we
                    are wasting our time just sitting out here. We should be traveling back in the
                    US, pushing American business to come and invest here.” It was a thought that
                    had just occurred to me on the spur of the moment. But Bob picked up on it
                    immediately and said it was a great idea. He said he was going back to
                    Washington in a few days and he promised to raise the suggestion there. Orr did
                    just that and got Deputy Secretary Eagleburger's support, as well as Under
                    Secretary Bob Zellick's. The EA Bureau said it thought it was a great idea, but
                    didn't come through with any money or support. I think the Deputy Secretary and
                    the Under Secretary did genuinely support the idea, but the Bureau just gave it
                    lip service. But I did get a message from Bob Driscoll, the chairman of the
                    ASEAN Business Council in Washington. He wanted to know what his organization
                    could do to make such a trip through the US successful.</p>
                <p>The first Ambassadorial group that was supposed to beat the US business bushes
                    consisted of Orr, John Monjo—from Indonesia—and myself. Monjo wanted a larger
                    group, however, so we expanded it to include all the US Ambassadors to the ASEAN
                    countries, and included our Charge' in Brunei. In the Spring of 1992, we took
                    our commercial counselors and some representatives of relevant Washington
                    agencies (EX-IM, OPIC, etc) and hit the US road. We visited seven cities. We
                    started in Portland where we had 350 businessmen attend our conference. Chuck
                    Knight, the Chairman of NIKE, was instrumental in making the Portland conference
                    a success. In fact, NIKE financed the whole conference—at its college campus
                    south of Portland. Driscoll traveled with us; he introduced us. Then we each
                    gave short presentations. In the afternoon, the businessmen came to talk to the
                    Ambassadors from the countries in which they were interested. After Portland we
                    went to Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Detroit and several other cities in Michigan,
                    and then Washington and New York. It was a great success. CNN gave us some time
                    on its “Moneyline' show with Fred Dobbs. I think this tour did make a
                    difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>When we got to Washington, we were already pretty well known. So when we met with
                    the bureaucracy there, our meeting was attended by 150 senior officials—deputy
                    assistant secretaries and up. That gave us an opportunity to report on what we
                    had found across the country, what the problems and issues were and what the
                    possible solutions were.</p>
                <p>Our message across the US was that Southeast Asia was the fastest growing part of
                    the globe. The American business community had for too long neglected this
                    growing potential market; it had been too slow and too loath to go to places
                    like East Asia. The Japanese and other Asians were entering the American market.
                    If the trade imbalances were not rectified soon through some aggressive American
                    business activity in Southeast Asia we would lose a golden opportunity that
                    might never be recoverable. It was clear that the Japanese, for example, would
                    be competitive in the US and in East Asia, whereas the Americans would only be
                    competitive in the US. Under such circumstances, we would lose. Our argument
                    might have been somewhat overstated, but there was considerable truth to it. I
                    think we did bring that message home and it did begin to sink in.</p>
                <p>There was another serendipitous plus. We had a USIA man with us and he wrote
                    stories about our sales pitch. The results were evident; I got 25 favorable
                    press stories in the Malaysian press in the course of the two weeks I was on the
                    road. The USIA man just kept writing and the media in Southeast Asia just picked
                    them up and ran them—verbatim. The stories didn't vary very much one from the
                    other, but the Malaysian press ran them. This was an entirely new effort; no
                    American Ambassadors had ever done what we were doing. We got more press
                    attention on this commercial effort than we had ever had before on any issue.
                    They really gave us a lot of coverage and all favorable. They were mystified
                    that a group of American Ambassadors would be in the United States pushing
                    programs that benefitted the Southeast Asia countries. In fact, this particular
                    tour gave rise to subsequent traveling “shows” put on by the ASEAN Ambassadors
                    in Washington, also sponsored by the US-ASEAN Business Council. I have to give
                    great credit to Driscoll not only for the support he gave our group, but his
                    subsequent efforts as well. He managed to get free air fares for us, free rooms
                    at hotels, dinners sponsored by major corporations, etc. Flour in Houston took
                    us around in helicopters and huge Cadillac limousines. Some of the support we
                    got was incredible. It was a great success and that program continues to the
                    day.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>This is not to say that the day after I returned to Kuala Lumpur I was swamped
                    with new American businessmen wanting to seek opportunities in Malaysia. But we
                    did see some evidence of success, although a casual relationship is always hard
                    to establish in a situation such as this. But I have no question that our trip,
                    coming at a propitious moment, did have an impact on American attitudes about
                    doing business in Southeast Asia. It was my sense, and that of my colleagues,
                    that the Japanese were beating our pants off in Southeast Asia because our
                    business community had not made an effort. At the same time, the trade imbalance
                    issue was getting attention in the US; the importance of trade to our economic
                    well being was being increasingly recognized. President Bush went to Singapore
                    and Japan pushing car sales at that time—he did well in one place and not so
                    well in the other. But by 1992, the idea of a President going out to be a
                    salesman for US products was no longer met with raised eyebrows; the country was
                    beginning to understand the importance of trade and exports. So our trip was
                    well timed. It may also have been one of the first efforts by the US diplomatic
                    corps to see that US interest lay in the commercial side and that the Foreign
                    Service would have to adapt to that.I want to emphasize the “beginning” aspect
                    of the Department's interest in commercial work. There was no question that the
                    leadership understood what was going on. The EA Bureau was a little slow on the
                    uptake. But I do believe that the EA Bureau also eventually got the message.
                    When we came to Washington, we spent most of our time with Eagleburger and
                    Zellick. I think Eagleburger was genuinely impressed; he was amazed by the
                    reception we had gotten and the interest we had attracted. Zellick was also very
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>I think it is fair to say—and my later assignment confirmed my views—that the
                    Department of State, as an institution, has never been interested in commercial
                    work. It is true that in the more recent past, the Department has tried to be
                    more involved in commercial work. On the other hands, I think it has been the
                    custom and not the exception to find Embassies rather than the Department
                    working hard on commercial issues. Many are doing a very effective work; they
                    are on top of issues and are helping in pushing US business trying to win
                    contracts for US companies. Many of these Embassies are getting increasingly
                    more effective support from the country desks in Washington. I am sure that more
                    and more Ambassadors found that with the end of the Cold War, the US could best
                    influence events in their countries through economic/commercial channels.
                    Improvements in US commercial activities were the main challenge left for US
                    Ambassadors and their staffs. In addition, commercial work in the field is kind
                    of fun. You can go see a cabinet minister and maybe come away with a $100
                    million contract. That is very satisfying. But I must note that the Department
                    itself has had a more difficult time changing its focus. It is still wedded to
                    political and politico/military issues with which it feels more comfortable, but
                    I think over the years, it has shown some shift in its perceptions of the
                    importance of various bilateral issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>On the military side while I was in Malaysia, there was an ongoing negotiation on
                    a “Status of Forces” agreement. There had been an increasing relationship
                    between the military of both countries. It was never a major program, but it was
                    of some important to both sides. We never had many US military personnel in
                    country at any one time. But we used to hold joint exercises and bring small
                    groups of special forces into the country. We brought naval forces into Lumut
                    and Penang harbors. We also considered deploying some aircraft on a temporary
                    basis. So our presence was never large, but we would on occasions have some
                    military in country on a temporary basis. We did have one military group
                    permanently stationed in Malaysia—probably a dozen officers and families. It was
                    responsible for inspection of US military aircraft being repaired AIROD—a
                    Malaysian government repair facility. Some of our C-130s were sent there for
                    maintenance and repair.</p>
                <p>The most interesting aspect of the SOFA negotiations was fulfilling our objective
                    of protecting our military from the draconian anti-drug laws that were in effect
                    in Malaysia and Singapore. We were negotiating SOFAs with both states
                    simultaneously. Our concern was that both countries made minimal possession of
                    any drugs a major crime which had the death penalty as a possible punishment. We
                    were worried more about the children of our military personnel than we were of
                    the uniformed personnel themselves. Kids have been known to exercise very poor
                    judgement, even in schools and we were anxious to protect against the
                    unacceptable punishments that the Malaysian or Singaporean authorities might
                    mete out under their laws. We finally developed language which gave us an escape
                    and made it clear that the Malaysian would treat any American military and his
                    family in accordance with “the mutual interest” of the two sides or words to
                    that effect. The Singapore government would not agree to such a clause and
                    negotiated a much more restrictive SOFA. The Malaysians were not happy when they
                    found out that they had not been accorded the same jurisdiction as had
                    Singapore. It never became a significant issue, but there were some tense
                    moments in that SOFA negotiation. Fortunately, we never had the need to test the
                    language of the Malaysian SOFA.</p>
                <p>The political relationship between the US and Malaysia was not as good as the
                    economic or military ones. In my view, this was due primarily to the fact that
                    Prime Minister Mahathir had not been invited to the White House by President
                    Bush and he then reacted in a querulous, petty fashion. Reagan had extended such
                    an invitation. But Mahathir had only briefly met with Bush and he then reacted
                    in a querulous, petty fashion.during a Boston University graduation ceremony,
                    when his son was graduating and Bush had given the commencement address. He then
                    had a twenty minute meeting with the President in “the locker room” as Mahathir
                    described it. Bush had to rush off to entertain Mitterrand. That left a bad
                    taste in Mahathir's mouth. So he was upset by his perception of the way Bush was
                    treating him. On several occasions we pointed out to Washington what was bugging
                    Mahathir. Of course, there is always great competition among the leaders of all
                    countries to receive an invitation to the White House. Our President just
                    doesn't have enough time for all of them. In addition, Mahathir was not highly
                    regarded in Washington, particularly in light of his anti-Western statements. He
                    took direct aim at Australians. He also said some things about the US which were
                    not well received in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>In addition, Secretary of State James Baker did not have a very high regard for
                    Mahathir. The question of the EAEG (East Asian Economic Group which later became
                    the East Asian Economic Caucus) arose. Mahathir thought that APEC needed a
                    counterbalance. APEC was an organization which the US had nourished and
                    supported for many years. Mahathir wanted an organization for Asian countries
                    only. That was unwelcome to us because we were afraid that the second
                    organization would divide the Asia-Pacific area into separate blocks, thereby
                    weakening the Pan Pacific structure we were trying to establish. It would have
                    meant that the Asians would be in one block and the rest of the Pacific nations
                    in another.</p>
                <p>While I agreed on that point, my view was quite different than that espoused by
                    the Department on how we should proceed. We did agree that the Malaysian
                    proposal was a bad one; so we had no disagreement with Washington on the
                    objectives. What we in the Embassy in Kuala Lumpur did disagree on were the
                    tactics on EAEG. We did not believe that a frontal attack was the best approach.
                    If we were to openly oppose the idea, it would force the proud Mahathir to dig
                    in his heels and defend his idea vigorously. It was the advice of other Asian
                    countries that the US not oppose the idea outright. Low key, indirect opposition
                    was a better approach, we wrote. The Department at first just told us politely
                    that it was not convinced by our rationale and asked that we not comment in any
                    way on the Mahathir idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>We then suggested in a message that the EAEG be turned into a caucus as a part of
                    APEC. It seemed logical that the Asians would meet separately, but as part of an
                    overall Asian Pacific (APEC) forum. That got a rapid and very forceful negative
                    response from Washington. It was suggested that I just shut up about this
                    issue.Then, unbeknown to me, Dick Solomon—probably at the request of Bob Zellick
                    or the Secretary—asked Mike Armacost, our Ambassador in Tokyo, to go to an Asian
                    Society meeting in Bali and speak against EAEG. There, Mahathir gave a
                    blistering anti-American speech showing his irritation with our negative
                    position on his idea—the EAEG. That was a major error on the Prime Minister's
                    part. He alienated the US businessmen in the audience, but more important he
                    alienated President Suharto. He knew that Suharto of Indonesia—the host
                    country—did not favor EAEG, nor was he in favor of alienating the US. In fact,
                    Suharto was upset that Mahathir would use a venue in his country to support an
                    idea he opposed and to his “friend”—the US. Furthermore, both Suharto and
                    Mahathir were competing for the mantle as spokesman for Southeast Asia which had
                    been worn by Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore. Naturally, Suharto was angry about the
                    speech. The next day, Armacost gave a speech in which he outright rejected the
                    concept of an EAEG. I understand that all the Asian countries just shook their
                    heads at this debate. The Japanese Ambassador—a brilliant man—in Kuala Lumpur
                    had told me repeatedly that the US should just stay out of the EAEG debate and
                    leave it to the Asians themselves; they would kill the idea softly. One day the
                    Ambassador said to me: “Leave EAEG alone. We Asians will lead it into an
                    honorable cul-de-sac.” I think that was a great line, but we nevertheless chose
                    to oppose EAEG openly and forcefully, thereby embarrassing and angering
                    Mahathir. Fortunately, Indonesia and Japan shared our basic opposition to EAEG;
                    neither country wanted to alienate its strongest ally and friend. They managed
                    to quietly downplay EAEG.</p>
                <p>After making this speech, Mike Armacost called me from Tokyo and apologized. He
                    told me that he had given it under instructions. I appreciated the call. But by
                    that time, the damage was done and I had to live with this US tactic. I think
                    that the Asians would have sidetracked the idea without us, possibly more
                    quickly and with less anger had we not intervened. In any case, EAEG did not
                    endear Mahathir to Baker who had reservations about the Malaysian Prime Minister
                    for other reasons as well. But the Bali conference and its aftermath certainly
                    killed any chance of Mahathir being invited to the White House and with that
                    went any hope of our having much influence in Malaysia on political issues. In
                    fact, it became US policy to disregard Mahathir as much as possible and to
                    oppose him openly whenever the opportunity arose. My advice was different; I
                    thought that had we invited Mahathir to Washington and played to his ego a
                    little, that we could have at least neutralized him if not actually won him
                    over. I think that was the best course, but the administration refused to do
                    that. The Clinton administration, on the other hand, did invite Mahathir to
                    lunch and now has a solid friend in Southeast Asia. The Malaysians showed their
                    gratitude by buying F-18s for a sizeable amount of money.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>It was not all our fault. Mahathir had a very prickly personality to go along
                    with his perceived neglect. He was a difficult character to get along with. He
                    complained a lot publically and I thought took every conceivable occasion to
                    make his unhappiness known. Baker had come to Kuala Lumpur in 1991 for a APEC
                    Ministerial meeting. He paid a courtesy call on Mahathir. I heard that he later
                    told some people in Tokyo that he felt that he had been insulted by Mahathir
                    because the Prime Minister had received him wearing a bush jacket—that was not
                    an appropriate attire. I think Baker's views are clearly shown in his book; he
                    was not very kind to Mahathir in that.</p>
                <p>One real insult showing how bad Mahathir could be was his refusal to take a phone
                    call from the President when Bush visited Singapore in the Spring of 1992. Bush
                    had asked me about Mahathir and concluded from my comments that Mahathir was a
                    “proud man.” I agreed. Bush then tried to appease Mahathir by telephoning him
                    from his plane. When Mahathir refused to talk, the Americans were dumbfounded. I
                    took some pleasure in saying to a chagrined Foreign Ministry official that:
                    “Even Saddam Hussein would take a call from the President of the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>I only had one private meeting with Mahathir during my tour; otherwise he would
                    not see me. That meeting didn't take place until I had been in Kuala Lumpur for
                    several months. I finally got in to see him because I was about to return to the
                    US for consultations and I thought that I should at least be able to report that
                    I had seen the Prime Minister privately. The meeting was a dud; he just sat
                    there and said virtually nothing. I would ask questions and get monosyllabic
                    answers. I thought that Mahathir acted rather immaturely. He was just mad
                    because his personal vanity had been wounded.</p>
                <p>I may have exacerbated the problem myself. I tried to be helpful at one time
                    early on in my tour, when we were restricting financial flows around the world
                    of Iraqi funds. I sent letters to the six or seven pertinent Cabinet ministers
                    of Malaysia, informing them of our action, asking some questions about the
                    status of the funds and offering my assistance if they needed it. The Malaysians
                    somehow interpreted this as an effort on my part to undermine their government.
                    I think they found it inappropriate for me to be in contact with ministries
                    other than the Foreign Ministry on this subject, although on many other matters
                    I dealt directly with the pertinent minister; indeed I was expected to do so. In
                    this case however, they wished that I had sent only one letter to the Foreign
                    Minister who then would have contacted his Cabinet colleagues. I guess, in an
                    effort to be efficient, I took the wrong course; in retrospect it would
                    obviously have been better for me to write only to the Foreign Minister. I am
                    still not sure why they took such umbrage at this, but they did. My letters came
                    up in a Cabinet meeting, I was told, and then I was called in by the Director
                    for American Affairs at the Foreign Ministry to be lectured about my “serious
                    error in protocol.” But that was the one exception to what was otherwise a
                    professional relationship with the Malaysian bureaucracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>In 1991, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, Baker went to visit many of the countries that
                    had Security Council membership that year. He couldn't squeeze Malaysia in on
                    his trip but wanted to see the Foreign Minister Hassan in Los Angeles. The
                    Foreign Minister refused to go to LA to see Baker. So President Bush called
                    Mahathir when the latter was in Tokyo. That call was enough to get the Foreign
                    Minister to go to LA to see Baker. There were four countries that were not
                    supporting our position in the Security Council; Malaysia was one of them. When
                    the vote came up, Cuba and Yemen voted against us, but Malaysia was persuaded
                    and voted with us after Bush's call, the Baker-Hassan meeting and some excellent
                    work by Tom Pickering, our Ambassador to the UN. The Embassy was also involved,
                    but primarily as a supporting player to the actions of others.</p>
                <p>The UN vote was a tough decision for Mahathir; he had a lot of opposition among
                    radical Muslims. In fact, there was a lot of support for Iraq as the Gulf War
                    developed. We had the only real riots in front of the Embassy in my time—a
                    couple of hundred people who were hopping mad. These were Muslim radicals
                    showing their support for Saddam Hussein and their opposition to our bombing of
                    their “brothers.” So Mahathir had his domestic problems. The Chancery was given
                    some very heavy protection by the Malaysians because we were concerned that some
                    real “bomb throwers” might have infiltrated from outside Malaysia. It was the
                    only time in my career I felt personally threatened. Happily, Carter was in the
                    US. We took a lot of security precautions like barricades in front of doors,
                    etc. Fortunately, no one was hurt and the Gulf War came to an end rather
                    rapidly.</p>
                <p>As for other threats, there had been a Communist threat in Malaysia, but by the
                    time I got there, that had pretty well evaporated. There were a few communist
                    terrorists in the jungles, but they were not a threat except perhaps to
                    themselves and no one was really concerned.</p>
                <p>I got a good reception in Kuala Lumpur after my trade mission trip through the
                    US. The Trade Minister seemed a little mystified by what I had done; no American
                    Ambassador—nor any other Ambassador for that matter—had ever traveled through
                    his own country publicizing economic opportunities in his host country with such
                    fanfare. These opportunities were in the interest of both Malaysia and the US.
                    Our approach was new and I think the Malaysians were taken by surprise. As I
                    mentioned earlier, our road show did get wide attention in the Malaysian press
                    which I think further increased the government's curiosity. Given Mahathir's
                    personality and view about the US, it was probably hard for any Cabinet officer
                    to be outright pleased by my efforts, but I am sure they did not go unnoticed.
                    Despite my support for increased Malaysian economic growth, Mahathir's attitude
                    toward the US never improved in my time. He never acknowledged that we had tried
                    to help Malaysia.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>As I said, Mahathir's attitude toward the US never changed until the Clinton
                    administration took office and then (my guess is) only because he was extended
                    an invitation to the White House for lunch and Mahathir felt that he had finally
                    gotten the respect that was due him. But during my tour, the Department and the
                    NSC had firmly opposed any step toward Mahathir. As far as Bush's Washington was
                    concerned, Mahathir was just an annoyance. And that made my job in Kuala Lumpur
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1992 you came back to Washington to the
                        Coordinator for Export Controls. What was that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Carter became very ill, so we came home in August, 1992. At the end of
                    my tour in Malaysia, I was supposed to go the National Defense University (NDU)
                    to teach a course on East Asia. In the back of my mind, I also hoped that I
                    would find some time to write a book about my experiences and conclusions. In
                    fact, I did start that assignment, but it wasn't long before one of the
                    Department's senior officials, Frank Wisner, who had been Ambassador to the
                    Philippines and on the ASEAN Ambassadors' tour, called me. He had since that
                    trip become the Under Secretary for Security Assistance and Arms Control. He
                    needed some help on export controls and I accepted his offer. Allen Wendt had
                    preceded me; he had been in the job for several years. It was an ambassadorial
                    level position—Ambassador-at-Large. My name was never sent to the Senate for
                    confirmation. Had Bush won reelection and had Wisner remained as Under
                    Secretary, I think my nomination for an Ambassador-at-Large designation might
                    have been sent to the Hill; that might have been important had I remained in the
                    job.The Export Controller regulated dangerous dual use items to dangerous
                    countries. I should note that the Department had never objected to every export
                    license application for materials or goods going to communist or rogue
                    regimes—Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, etc. DoD used to object to almost
                    anything being sold to these countries. On the other hand, we also didn't want
                    to approve every application, as the Commerce Department was inclined to do. The
                    Department was selective, restricting the most dangerous things to the most
                    dangerous countries. That put the Department in the middle which gave it a
                    pivotal role in these decisions. So essentially the decisions on what license
                    applications to approve were made by the Department of State. That gave Allen
                    Wendt and then me, even though we were supported by a very small staff of four
                    people, a little clout in the American export field. We of course always
                    listened to the arguments of Defense and Commerce, but as the swing vote on many
                    occasions, we were in the driver's seat. The system required Commerce to make an
                    initial judgement on what further action an application might need because it
                    was the original recipient of the application. Once we had decided that an
                    application needed inter-agency review, it would send the application around to
                    all the interested agencies. I think the Commerce Department screening limited
                    the inter-agency review to a relatively small number of cases, but they were the
                    most controversial and contentious and the key ones in the export control
                    regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I performed that job for about four or five months. It was a good assignment. I
                    was pretty much the master of my own ship and had considerable freedom. My
                    approach to export controls was that, with the end of the Cold War, we needed to
                    change the focus of the program. It had already moved somewhat from concern with
                    exports to the Iron Curtain countries to export to the “rogue” states. I thought
                    that the trend was correct but that we should take a minimalist approach. I
                    wanted to focus on the most dangerous exports to the most dangerous countries.
                    In other words, I wanted our attention to concentrate on a relatively small
                    number of potential problems because I felt that if we tried to control too
                    much, we would not control anything at all. We couldn't get our partners—the
                    Germans, the French, the British—to agree to end the sales of all of the
                    products.</p>
                <p>Export controllers are essentially interested in materials which are called “dual
                    use”—e.g. very high tech computers, numerically controlled machine tools,
                    certain alloys—which can be used both for civilian and military purposes. For
                    example, we blocked machine tools for making nuclear weapons. It was those kinds
                    of materials and goods that we were interested in keeping out of the hands of
                    the world's most dangerous countries and people. There were and still are
                    international institutions that are concerned with non-proliferation of weapons
                    of mass destruction. They worried about missile exports and tried to control the
                    sale or transfers of nuclear material and chemical and biological armaments and
                    components. The Political Military Bureau handled those matters. My job was to
                    focus on the truly dangerous dual use items on our watch list. I started to try
                    to change the system to meet the new challenges of the post-Cold War world, with
                    emphasis on “dual use” materials and goods that might be used quite innocently
                    in the civilian sector, but might also be a key components in the manufacturing
                    of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.</p>
                <p>To illustrate our problem let me cite a case. The Department had difficulty over
                    the sale of Mack trucks to Iran; the Iranians loved those trucks but there were
                    some people who felt that they could be used to transport troops and military
                    material. It was a politically sensitive issue in an election year. I took the
                    position, backed by Wisner, that we should go ahead with that sale; the trucks
                    might well be used for military purposes, but there was no way that we could
                    insure that no other country would sell the trucks. Trucks were not the kind of
                    goods that we should worry about, I believed. There were some people who
                    objected the sale of anything to Iran and some other countries. In the final
                    analysis, we did embargo sales of Mack trucks and other American large trucks.
                    The only people that were penalized by our policy was the Mack truck company.
                    Mercedes and Volvo were delighted; they made the sales. Iran was happy; it got
                    trucks even if they weren't their first preference. The US policy was
                    self-defeating.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>As I said, we tried to get our allies to join us in determining a shorter, but
                    much more highly restrictive list of materials and goods that could not be
                    exported. For an embargo to be effective, all sources had to agree to it.
                    Eventually, we hoped to get the Russians to join us. We were also interested in
                    maintaining COCOM expertise. Its Secretariat was staffed with people who had
                    many years of experience and who in general had been very successful in limiting
                    exports to the Soviet Union. I thought that it would be useful to have those
                    people continuing to work on exports control issues; there was no good reason to
                    replace them and lose all that expertise. We were making some headway, I think,
                    towards this new export regime, when President Clinton replaced Bush. The new
                    administration seemed to have little interest in this minimalist approach to
                    export controls. I am not sure to this day what the new administration was
                    trying to do. I think it wanted to broaden the approach to include conventional
                    weapons. I don't think they were very effective; my understanding is they never
                    got our allies to support effectively whatever export control program was
                    developed.</p>
                <p>The Europeans were unquestionably difficult. We took the position of trying to
                    persuade them to support our new direction; i.e. to be very rigorous on a
                    limited number of items. The Europeans of course were looking for markets
                    wherever they could. They were not, in many respects, competitive with us and
                    they consequently were more interested in the commercial aspects of arms control
                    than the political/security issues that were of importance to us as the leader
                    of the Free World. So we were always in the position of trying to persuade the
                    Europeans that certain sales were not in our mutual interest. The British were
                    the most responsive usually; they often shared our concerns, but not always. The
                    Germans were the next most amenable Europeans—although on occasions they could
                    be troublesome as were the Japanese as well—and the Italians would usually side
                    with us. But the French were always difficult.</p>
                <p>I must say that this was my first experience in dealing with the European
                    community; I found it interesting to be able in a matter of a few days, to cover
                    so many capitals and have so many substantive conversations. It was a new
                    challenge that I enjoyed. I believe that if I had been given the opportunity to
                    pursue my goals after the US elections, we might have made some progress. I was
                    optimistic, even at the end, that the Europeans and the Japanese would
                    eventually sign on to our policy. I thought we could reach some agreement on a
                    very limited but tough policy. The goal of limiting access of material and
                    components and arms for certain countries and groups should hold some appeal to
                    all of the countries that might be subjected to threats from the states and
                    groups that practiced terrorism; I really thought that given time, we could
                    bring the Europeans and the Japanese around to our way of approaching the
                    subject of export controls. There were already certain elements in each
                    government that agreed with us; it was a matter of just working at the problem
                    and supporting the elements that agreed with us until governments accepted our
                    views as established policy. I thought we could build momentum.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>I told Lynn Davis, the new Under Secretary for Arms Control in the Clinton
                    administration, that I thought that we should continue to have commercial and
                    security interests compete within the Department, raising issues to the
                    Secretary if necessary. I used the truck to Iran issue as an illustration; there
                    our commercial and security interests clashed. There were many cases I said
                    where the regional bureaus, the arms control agencies and the economic bureau
                    not to mention other agencies differed in their perspectives and therefore in
                    their views on particular export license applications. Sometimes, they could
                    reach an agreed position; sometimes, they could not and if the issue was
                    important enough, I thought it was healthy for the Secretary or the Deputy
                    Secretary to become involved. Lynn Davis did not agree; she and Joan Spero—the
                    new Under Secretary for Economic Affairs—already had had this discussion. When I
                    made this argument, I was not anymore successful than Joan Spero had been. Davis
                    just stared at me—for about twenty seconds. It became an embarrassing situation;
                    she just stared at me and said nothing. I finally said something and left, not
                    only her office, but the position of Coordinator for Export Controls as well. In
                    fact, the position was changed to a deputy assistant secretaryship in the Bureau
                    of Politico/Military Affairs. That made the job part of the PM approach to
                    export controls which generally opposed a wide range of exports. That Bureau
                    kept professing that it had an open mind and was always available to listen to
                    the arguments of the American commercial exporter, but I don't think that has
                    been the case. To this day, American business is annoyed by the Department's
                    process under the Clinton administration. It does not feel that its interests
                    are being properly weighed. As I said, I argued for a balanced minimalist
                    approach to export controls, but that was not consonant with Davis' and the new
                    Administration's views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Lynn Davis in 1993 and became the Coordinator
                        for Business Affairs. What was that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Actually, after I left Davis' office, I went back to NDU. I had been
                    there only a few weeks when I was called by Joan Spero's Executive Assistant and
                    asked whether I would be interested in the Coordinator for Business Affairs job.
                    This was a new job that Joan was trying to establish in her office. So I talked
                    to her and then accepted the offer. She wanted someone who would insure that US
                    economic interests would be pursued with some vigor by the regional bureaus and
                    the overseas posts. She wanted the Department and the Foreign Service to be of
                    assistance to US business by supporting efforts it was making to win bids and
                    trying to sell American goods and services overseas. I told her that if she
                    really was serious about this position having an impact, she should then seek an
                    Ambassador-at-Large designation for the incumbent; that would have required
                    Senate confirmation. I should note parenthetically that the idea for such a
                    Coordinator had really started when Secretary Christopher made a statement on
                    the Hill that as secretary he was going to be the “American Desk Officer.” He
                    wanted to make it clear that the Department would really begin to support
                    American business and that it would view commercial interests as having a high
                    priority among US foreign policy objectives. I thought my suggestion was
                    consistent with that priority.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>But I immediately ran into difficulties. I was never given a Senate confirmed
                    appointment; I never met the Secretary; my position was in fact just part of the
                    Economic Bureau working for Dan Terullo, who was the Assistant Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs. In fact, Terullo seemed opposed to the idea of a special
                    coordinator and I think viewed me as suspect the whole time I was there. So
                    bureaucratically, I didn't have any clout and my boss really didn't give me much
                    time, attention, or support.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I started trying to organize the Department to give some muscle to
                    the Secretary's declaration. I asked each regional bureau to designate an
                    official who would be responsible for promoting US commercial interests in his
                    or her region. On paper, the bureaus would appoint a deputy assistant secretary,
                    who would immediately assign the task to the Office for Economic Affairs where
                    it would be handled by a deputy. I was trying to get the Department organized to
                    participate both in Washington and overseas in this push for American business
                    interests. In Washington, this called for a major cultural change in the
                    Department which hither to had given lip service, if that much, to US commercial
                    interests. Actually, I think there was considerable support for this change;
                    there were many officials who not only accepted but were interested in the new
                    commercial emphasis in foreign policy. To the extent that we could get this
                    large target to be the focus of activity within the US government, I believe
                    that it was a worthwhile effort.</p>
                <p>I think we accomplished a couple of things. First, we set up an office which,
                    even given its relatively low level in the bureaucracy, raised the Department's
                    consciousness about the issue. We held some conferences on the subject of
                    government assistance to US business, addressed and attended by representatives
                    of business and the bureaucracy. We set up a series of breakfast meetings
                    between the Secretary and businessmen, although, after arranging this series, I
                    was not invited to attend it—which seemed a little odd. We also held meetings
                    with the business coordinators in the regional bureaus. We worked with OES on
                    some actions. We undertook to work with some specific companies when they
                    visited the Department. Most important we started to weigh in on some major
                    commercial cases.</p>
                <p>Outside the Department, we participated in a Commerce Department managed process,
                    led by Jeff Garten, the Under Secretary for Commerce. This consisted in part of
                    an inter-agency group—Commerce, Treasury, OPIC, Ex-Imp Bank and State. This
                    group began to work on specific cases; e.g. a large contract to be let by Brazil
                    for radar installations—the American manufacturer was Raytheon. We succeeded in
                    helping Raytheon to win this billion dollar plus contract. One of the major
                    components of the US offer was the Export Import Bank's willingness to match the
                    financial offers included in a French bid. Through our intelligence sources, we
                    found out what the French were offering and then EX-IM matched it. That was a
                    first, I think. In addition, we got President Clinton to write to his Brazilian
                    counterpart in support of the Raytheon bid.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>We had other similar successes, all of which we circulated to the field and to
                    Departmental bureaus, so that they would understand that a new priority had been
                    established in diplomacy. We did a lot of promotional work. We were never able
                    to crack the export control process. American industry was upset with that
                    process which unfortunately offset much of the goodwill we gained. I might also
                    say that Secretary Christopher really never gave US exports the kind of support
                    that Larry Eagleburger, for example, had given. The fellow who was doing
                    business support work—Al White—saw Eagleburger all the time, even though he
                    didn't have the title of “Coordinator.” If Eagleburger received a call from some
                    American businessman, he would call White to his office and give him explicit
                    directions on actions to be taken. As I said, I never saw the Secretary or the
                    Deputy Secretary. I would see Joan Spero who was supportive but busy.</p>
                <p>My conclusion: Our Embassies overseas are now in the forefront of putting US
                    business high on their policy objectives; I think the Washington bureaucracy,
                    however, is playing catch up ball. Ron Brown went around the world plugging US
                    business; he was instrumental in raising the profile of this effort in the minds
                    of Washington and the field. I am not sure whether the policy objective was the
                    priority or raising Ron Brown's visibility was the first goal, but he certainly
                    succeeded in raising the level of support that the US government provides US
                    business. I think the jury is still probably out on the question of how
                    effective in general these efforts have been and whether they will have a
                    lasting impact—in comparison to the efforts of other governments. It is
                    certainly clear that in individual cases, the US government involvement was
                    crucial and perhaps even pivotal.</p>
                <p>It is also certainly true that US imports have grown considerably in the last
                    decade; how much of that can be attributed to US government support has yet to
                    be determined. I think that in the Japanese situation, for example, you can say
                    with some certainty that the involvement of its government in export promotion
                    has been critical. As I say, there is growing evidence that our embassies are
                    beginning to be instrumental, but a total evaluation is yet to be made. It is
                    also true that Clinton may be the first—at least among the first—who has picked
                    up the phone or pen and made his support for an American business venture known
                    to his counterpart in an another country. Nevertheless, I still think that the
                    Washington bureaucracy could have done more and I did leave the Coordinator job
                    in some frustration.</p>
                <p>I was ready to retire in 1994 in any case, but after a year as Coordinator, in
                    light of lack of support from higher echelons, I felt little incentive to stay.
                    Had such support been forthcoming, I might have stayed and perhaps could have
                    moved the ball a little further, but in the absence of that key factor, I
                    thought export promotion should be done by someone else. There are opportunities
                    for the Department to be helpful to American business; it just hasn't yet become
                    excited by that prospect. If the Secretary really decided to be the “American
                    Desk Officer” and push American exports and investments, the Department could be
                    a major player. But it needs a change in the culture of the Department; the
                    transfer of the commercial service from the State Department to Commerce, which
                    took several years ago, was not seen as a great loss by the Department at the
                    time and I don't think there has been an sufficient change of attitude
                    since.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul, for some reason I neglected to ask you whether you
                        had any final thoughts on your career. You might want to add something at
                        the end of this interview on that issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CLEVELAND: Final thoughts on my Foreign Service career are largely positive. Even
                    discounting some of the rose-colored hindsight we tend to have, I recall often
                    saying to myself how much I was enjoying my work and my life, overseas
                    particularly. Where else could one have such an opportunity to learn about
                    history, politics, economics and foreign culture, and then actually have an
                    opportunity to write and do something about them—no matter how small a
                    something. The professional career was interesting always, sometimes exciting,
                    and in the end rewarding. The chance to live in, not just visit foreign places
                    was personally enjoyable. Life constantly imposed itself on you and was full of
                    surprises—usually interesting, although sometimes unpleasant. The FSOs we knew
                    were largely outstanding people and friends.</p>
                <p>Regrets? I feel that I could have done better throughout my life helping Carter
                    and our children enjoy the overseas experience. Carter was often stuck with the
                    hard chores: health, education, entertaining an endless stream of officials. She
                    was the best there was in East Asia at what she did, and deserved more attention
                    and support than I gave. Too often my fun was at family expense. But as C. says:
                    you cannot erase the tape.</p>
                <p>Would I do it again? Yes. And I'd do it in East Asia which I have seen grow from
                    revolution to extraordinary success. Also I'd work harder, yet still do more for
                    family. I'd try to exercise more self discipline, more dedication, more
                    thought...but to be realistic, without luck, I would never have the same great
                    opportunities. I think I was suited for the Foreign Service life, although
                    others probably would demur. In any event, it was good to me, and I am
                    grateful.</p>
