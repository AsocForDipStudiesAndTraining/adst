                <p>Preface</p>
                <p>The following interview covers the period from 1949 to 1980, during 28 years of
                    which I was a foreign service officer in the U.S. foreign assistance programs.
                    The discussion covers much of the substance of my work. What it does not cover
                    is a great matter in person terms, that this was a considerable part of my life.
                    My wife, Marilyn Alley Jonnes, whom I had married in 1947, accompanied me on all
                    of these assignments. Our three children, Denis, Michael, and Jill, were all
                    born in Switzerland and grew up around the world. The friends we made and the
                    colleagues with whom we served are the very texture of our life. The
                    intellectual adventure that this career opened was extraordinary. In the large
                    picture these elements tend to disappear. In our lives they were and are our
                    life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is with Lloyd Jonnes, who started in the
                        foreign assistance program in 1949 and retired from AID in 1980. To start
                        off Lloyd, let's have a little discussion about where you came from, your
                        early years, where you grew up, your education and then go from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years, education and work experience</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JONNES: I was born and brought up in Circleville, Ohio, a small town south of
                    Columbus. I graduated from high school there in 1941 and went off to Hobart
                    College in Geneva, New York that fall. The United States of course entered the
                    war perforce December, 1941, and I went on active duty in the Army in May, 1943.
                    The following two and a half years were the most important years of my life in
                    that I survived the war. I was a combat infantryman in Western Europe and served
                    in Patton's army. My division, the 80th Infantry Division, arrived in Normandy
                    in early August, 1944 and then fought all the way to Austria. Our first major
                    fighting was in the Falaise-Argentan Gap. We then swung around to the east out
                    through Orleans to Sens, then moved almost due north toward Metz and Nancy. We
                    fought in Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge, thereafter attacked up
                    towards Bitburg, Mainz, and into Central Germany through Kassel to Chemnitz.
                    From there, we moved down to N�rnberg and Regensburg, and into Austria. We ended
                    the war in the Salskammergut near Gmunden.Immediately after the war, the U.S.
                    Army set up an unusual experiment, a temporary university system designed to
                    give the American educational community an opportunity to see how combat
                    veterans were going to react to going back to college. I was in school for two
                    months in Shrivenham, England— a very pleasant change from combat. I returned to
                    the States in November, 1945 and returned to school in April of '46 at Antioch
                    College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you switch to go to Antioch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Because Hobart was in some part a preparatory college for the Episcopal
                    church, and I was not really interested in the religious realm. Moreover, at
                    that time Antioch had a most intriguing educational experiment designed to put
                    work experience together with your academic education. My first job was as an
                    intern with the National Labor Relations Board down in Atlanta, Georgia, working
                    in Georgia and Alabama in 1947. Unbelievable, the archaic labor practices in
                    those states at that time, not to mention the even more startling fact that
                    reconstruction from the Civil War was in considerable part still in progress.
                    While there we were holding elections to determine collective bargaining agents
                    for particular companies as well as investigating unfair labor practices -
                    deeply interesting work experience. I graduated from Antioch technically in
                    1949, but actually in 1948.</p>

                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In the fall of that year we went to Europe so that I could study for one year at
                    the University of Zurich before coming back to law school. At the end of the
                    year in Zurich, quite by chance I was offered a job - a temporary job naturally
                    - with the then U. S. Legation in Bern as they were setting up a small office of
                    the Economic Cooperation Administration, the body administering the Marshall
                    Plan, to keep the Swiss government informed on the program, but more
                    importantly, if possible to help the Swiss participate with us in the provision
                    of resources. The latter was the objective of the exercise. In point of fact,
                    most of that work on that issue was done in Paris through the negotiations to
                    establish Swiss participation in the intra-European payments clearing system and
                    thereafter the European Payments Union. In both instances Swiss credits were
                    made available through these institutions to finance in some measure the trade
                    of the other European nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Swiss survived the war with very little setbacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, in terms of the physical state of the nation for there was of course
                    no fighting on Swiss soil. But, the Swiss had had a difficult war in the sense
                    that at any time the Germans had wanted to , they, the Germans, could have
                    invaded Switzerland, but the price would have been very high, I'm sure, inasmuch
                    as the Swiss were determined to maintain their independence down to the last
                    man. In any event it never came to war, but the negotiations - ceaseless
                    negotiations between the Swiss and Germans over every aspect of the Swiss
                    national being— took quite a toll on the Swiss administration. In retrospect one
                    can only admire that the Swiss managed to get through the war intact. I think at
                    the same time, those of us on the American side felt that the Swiss could
                    certainly have done a great deal more than they did in terms of making life
                    difficult for the Germans. And of course there is just now a major disturbance
                    in our relations with the Swiss over their treatment of the Jewish communities
                    during the war. The central fact of the Swiss economy is its dependency upon
                    external tradTo live during the war, they were forced to do business with the
                    Germans in one way or another.</p>
                <p>In any event, the ECA started a small operation there — a part of the economic
                    section of the then US Legation — designed to work with the Swiss on all aspects
                    of the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your taking this position evolve from an earlier
                        interest in international work or from an earlier period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JONNES: I think my first real interest came in seeing what Europe was at the end
                    of the war. So far as Germany and Austria were concerned, it looked as if they
                    could never, ever recover from the tremendous physical damage that had been done
                    during the war. At the same time, intellectually, many of us had been
                    conditioned by Keynes' observations at the time of the Versailles negotiations
                    at the end of World War I that unless Germany was economically healthy, Europe
                    was not going to be economically healthy. This was a necessary condition to the
                    recovery of the European economic structure. It's impossible I think now to
                    communicate the sense of impoverishment, the sense of despair and hopelessness
                    that characterized much of Europe when we arrived there in the summer of 1948 to
                    go to school in Zurich. Switzerland was the one exception because they had not
                    really suffered physically and they were doing quite well, but in France,
                    Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, all these places we visited it was deeply
                    depressing and the question was what do we do about it. I think the American
                    response through the Marshall Plan was a truly extraordinary phenomenon and in
                    very sharp contrast to what was done after World War I. At that time, the
                    question was largely one of punitive measures in that our European allies — led
                    by Clemenceau — were determined that they would be recompensed in some form by
                    the Germans for all the damage done during the war, not recognizing that only if
                    the German economy were healthy would the Germans be able to even begin to pay
                    substantial reparations. American policy in 1948 and 1949, and through the end
                    of the Marshall Plan was extraordinary because I think the total value of the
                    aid provided was on the order of $13.5 billion which in today's dollar would be
                    as much as $100 billion—a massive infusion of economic resources. That Truman
                    was able to put this through was one of the great political acts in the United
                    States of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>To have worked with this program, if only on the very edge of it, was fascinating
                    because we in Bern were treated in effect as a small mission of the Marshall
                    Plan even though the Swiss were getting nothing under the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Swiss supposed to provide - what were you
                        trying to get them to do specifically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Specifically we were trying to make sure that they participated in the
                    financing of those systems of intra-European payment clearings through which
                    individual European nations would have additional import financing. The first of
                    these was set up, I believe, in 1948. It was worked out at the OECD and
                    administered by the Bank of International Settlements in Basel. In 1950 the
                    European Payment Union was established, and here again the question was what
                    will be the amount of credit facilities available, and again we were interested
                    in having the Swiss provide the maximum that they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Swiss responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JONNES: I haven't looked at data in recent years, but my impression was that they
                    were indeed responsive. After all their own interests as exporters were at
                    stake. One of our tasks was to maintain communications between the people in
                    Paris who were working on these programs and the Swiss. While our colleagues in
                    Paris could do that in Paris or in Basle, through the Bank of International
                    Settlements, one of our chores was simply to maintain a flow of information on
                    what was going on in Switzerland and in that sense, we were very much a part of
                    the small legation staff working on economic matters.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of my work in Bern was that the system of export controls on
                    critical or strategic items going to the Soviets and their satellites came into
                    being at that time, and I worked on that issue on occasion. Particularly, I did
                    a great deal of reporting on the trade agreements that the Swiss were concluding
                    with the various East European nations, but this was really straight economic
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was for one year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We were in Bern from 1949 to 1953. There were other responsibilities over
                    time. After the North Korean invasion of South Korea, the U.S. military became
                    very interested in procurement in Switzerland and because I was there and knew
                    German and a great deal about Swiss industry, I spent much time in working with
                    procurement people from the Department of Defense, taking them around the
                    country and showing them what the Swiss could provide and did ultimately
                    provide. The Swiss were very much interested naturally in selling to DOD, but
                    this had little or nothing to do with the International Development Program.</p>
                <p>Yet another task had to do with a very interesting aspect of technical assistance
                    - -actually, two small programs. At one point, the technical assistance people
                    in Washington worked out a program to bring young apprenticed technical workers
                    from the Marshall Plan member nations to the States for a year of work-study -
                    on the job training and study at universities. The Swiss were very interested in
                    this, but of course they would have to pay for it themselves. They were willing
                    to do so, and thus we worked out a very small program under which each Swiss
                    participant paid for all his living costs and travel himself, but effectively
                    got the training and schooling for free.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Primarily in machine construction and metal-working, e. g., machine
                    tools. The Swiss participants - very young men - thought this was marvelous
                    because it gave them the chance to live in the States, to see America, and at
                    the same time to do some study, say in mechanical engineering, and to work in an
                    America plant.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The second program was actually part of an OECD program which was a form of work
                    study but at the management level. Swiss entrepreneurs were very interested in
                    the study missions to the States and here again they paid their own way together
                    with a standard fee for all of the ancillary costs and participated. We had a
                    remarkable selection of senior Swiss management that came to the States paying
                    for it themselves, but nominally as part of the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where they could update their technology?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Or at least see how they might do so. That's right because there were two
                    aspects of the Marshall Plan. The primordial facet was to help the Europeans to
                    cope with the damage and attrition of the war. But the European world had also
                    gone through the terrible depression of the 1930's, and that too had left it's
                    mark, perhaps most acutely ain combination with the war. We in the US as a
                    consequence of the war went through a technological explosion that the Europeans
                    knew little of. Not only were they unaware of the dimensions of these changes,
                    but their industry was still suffering from the stagnation and massive
                    depreciation of their industrial base. For obvious reasons they were very much
                    interested in trying to catch up, as in fact they did in the context of
                    recovery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that was one of the major contributions to the
                        revival of the European economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think so. That's a big question, but certainly these programs were one
                    significant element. The volume of technical assistance at that time was very
                    great. Now I'm not talking of Switzerland, but what we were doing across the
                    board.Yet another element of our technical assistance had to do with labor. Many
                    in the organized labor movements in Switzerland were also much interested in
                    what was going on in the States. Here, too, they would pay their own way to
                    participate in those various labor programs that fell under the Marshall Plan.
                    Here again, I was an intermediary between the Swiss and our Washington
                    headquarters.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I began my studies at Antioch, and then studied at the University of
                    Zurich. In fact the German language was why I was originally hired because the
                    Legation didn't have any American German speakers on the economic side for some
                    reason.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, because of my personal interest in the origins of “our” war, I had
                    wanted to study somewhere in Germany, but the German universities were
                    effectively closed to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Political Economy. A lot of economics.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Swiss at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I was deeply impressed by their having brought together at least four
                    different cultures into one nation—the Italian, French, German and what had
                    remained of the Roman army culture in eastern Switzerland, the Romansch— and
                    having survived the Reformation with all of its centrifugal forces. Also I was
                    intrigued by their ability to work out economic problems of industry without
                    violence. They had come to recognize—i. e., each side of the labor management
                    conflict recognized— that they had to agree in order to survive. If they were
                    going to survive economically, they would have to be successful exporters, the
                    necessary condition of which was that they would have to be price competitive.
                    And they have succeeded.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I used to go to Paris regularly for one meeting or another at the Office
                    of the Special Representative of the ECA. In 1953 I was transferred to Vienna.
                    Quite a different experience. In Bern from 1951 I was the only ECA officer. In
                    Vienna the Mission was quite large because Austria had been receiving
                    substantial assistance from us. We were there until 1956. There initially my
                    principal function was as an analyst of the balance of payments.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Well, I was a regular employee of ECA.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Reassigned to ECA in Vienna - 1953</p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, reassigned to Vienna. We came back on home leave in '52. My first
                    task in Vienna was to do the balance of payments forecast for six months of 1953
                    for the Austrians. Lo and behold, their balance of payments had completely
                    turned around and they received their last allotment of Marshall Plan aid in
                    June, 1953, That was the end of the actual Marshall Plan as such. We continued
                    on with a small mission for several years thereafter, primarily to wind up a
                    number of programs, but more importantly to maintain a watching briethat the
                    Austrians were making the transition out of occupation to independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Austrian economy at the time you
                        started there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It was booming in 1953 for a variety of reasons. There was a high degree
                    of domestic political stability. Second, the Germans had made substantial
                    investments there during the war for obvious reasons. Third, the nation had
                    received a large volume of American aid. The rest of Europe, too, by 1953 was
                    growing rapidly which reflected itself in Austria's exports and tourism
                    industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it not so badly damaged as other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not so badly. Yes, some parts had been bombed and fought over, but the
                    physical damage was not at all that bad. One of the real shocks for the Austrian
                    economy was the seizure by the Russians of all significant industrial
                    establishments in the Russian zone after they had moved in. This conglomeration
                    was called the USIA complex, having nothing to do with our USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA stood for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>JONNES: It was an abbreviation, in Russian I believe, for the former German-owned
                    industrial plants seized by the Russians in 1945. Consistent with anything that
                    offered a chance for profit the Russians moved a great deal of machinery out to
                    Russia. It was all part of the indemnification of the Russians for the damage
                    inflicted upon them by the Germans, and Russians were determined they would make
                    good from anything they could make good from.In 1954, one of our principle
                    operations in Austria were the sales under the Public Law 480 programs which had
                    just come into being. One of my principal functions was working out these
                    programs with the Austrians. Then, quite suddenly at the end of 1954, it was
                    becoming fairly clear that there were going to be serious negotiations on the
                    political status of Austria. There had been a series of negotiations in the
                    immediate post-war period on an Austrian state treaty. These had come to naught
                    because basically the Russians were not prepared to agree. But quite suddenly
                    toward the very end of 1954 or very early in '55, the Russians indicated that
                    they would be prepared to negotiate seriously, and mirabile dictu the
                    negotiations resulted in a state treaty which came into effect May 15, 1955, and
                    Austria was independent in the most meaningful sense of the word. One critical
                    question for us as we were looking at the economic side was what would be the
                    impact of the state treaty on Austria. Our colleagues in Washington people were
                    quite concerned lest the successes of the Marshall Plan in Austria might be
                    jeopardized by the tremendous costs of undoing the damage done by the Russians
                    in their zone. We did a study of the economy that suggested Austria's economy
                    should have little difficulty in the transition. We had lots of information
                    available from miscellaneous sources on what was going on in the Russian zone
                    economically, and the conclusion was Austria had reached economic viability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Russian zone constitute a major share of the
                        economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In rough terms each of the three major occupying powers held a third of
                    the country plus a share of Vienna. In terms of the size of the Austrian
                    economy, I imagine Russian share was something less than a third. Vienna itself
                    was under four power occupation with the central district being truly under
                    international control, but then each occupying power had part of the city and
                    the Russians in their segment had their hands on the economy quite
                    literally.Living in Vienna at that time was also fascinating. I think of the
                    movie, “The Third Man” with Orson Wells. When we first arrived , we could not
                    move out of the city except on one or the other of two routes, driving either on
                    the one to the British zone or the one to the American zone. Other than on those
                    highways we could not drive outside the city limits without special permission
                    from the Russians . And even with the permit you would find yourself stopped at
                    checkpoint and have Russians with their tommy-guns at your head even though you
                    were perfectly legitimate. This tended to persuade one to stay at home.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JONNES: You couldn't travel around the Russian zones at all except when we drove
                    all the way out by designated route.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American zone? British zone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In the American and British zones we could travel of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that would roughly be a third?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, we had roughly about third. The French had a small area over by Lake
                    Constance that we had given them as a consolation prize.. We had the Tyrol and
                    Salskammergut, and the Brits had Steiremark and Carinthia.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We enjoyed our years there. Perhaps the adversity of being off on the
                    edge of Western Europe under unsettled conditions added zest. The music of
                    Vienna was marvelous even though the opera did not move back into its permanent
                    home until 1955.In that same year our modus operandi changed significantly after
                    the state treaty. The American aid mission came to an end as such, and what had
                    been the U.S. High Commission in Austria was transformed into the Embassy. In
                    effect in those days under the High Commission, the High Commissioner had been
                    our ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, rather, we were concerned only to maintain a watching brief on the
                    Austrian economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't any particular sector you were

                <p>JONNES: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There were massive amounts of counterpart monies. That's absolutely
                    correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were programming this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We were not programming, we were looking at it after the Austrians
                    programmed it. You know we would take our 5%, I guess it later became 10%, under
                    the Zablocki Amendment. The real question was where control of this should lie
                    and obviously it had to be in the first instance with the Austrians. As long as
                    inflation was under control I think we would not be too concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were not dealing with the allocation by sector or
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think that in a country as sophisticated as Austria, there are so many
                    devices to achieve effective allocation of financial resources that there was
                    little point in debate. On the margin, perhaps our recommendations might have
                    had some effect, for example in the amounts of local resources going to new
                    tourist facilities..Perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then the counterpart, was that a major problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. But one aspect of the matter was a small problem, that of what we
                    called “the price gap.” There had been a shortfall in the deposits of
                    counterpart by the Austrians against what we thought the should have been
                    deposited. This arose in effect because the Austrians were selling the goods
                    being imported at a lower price than we had thought they would or could, so the
                    amounts of schillings (as the counterpart of the aid) deposited with the
                    National Bank were below the expected amounts, ergo, a gap, and of course the
                    question was whether the Austrians would ever be called upon to deposit the full
                    amount in the counterpart accounts. The gap was a de facto subsidy to the
                    Austrian economy, and ultimately we acquiesced in accepting the de facto
                    subsidy/. we finally worked this out in the most general of terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we providing any assistance for them... food
                        shortage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JONNES: We were providing food aid largely because of our domestic concerns with
                    surplus grain supplies, i.e., simply as a U. S. interest. The Austrian interest
                    was in minimizing the foreign exchange costs of commodities they needed— they
                    were a large importer of wheat at that time from the United States. They were
                    delighted to get it without spending dollars even though their foreign exchange
                    situation had improved markedly. I would add parenthetically that one of the
                    critical questions for all of the European countries was that once they reached
                    a reasonable balance of payments how should they dismantle this great complex of
                    import regulations designed to cope with the previous balance of payment
                    problems. How do you liberalize? One of our constant concerns with the Austrians
                    was to have them recognize our legitimate interests in exporting to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other conditions that you were implying in
                        conjunction with your balance of payments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not really. Until 1953, in that period from 1945 to 1953, the United
                    States High Commission had been remarkably involved with the Austrian economy in
                    extraordinary detail because of the universal view that the Austrian economy was
                    a basket case. A personal note. In May, 1945, I ended up the war in Austria and
                    even then it was very clear that there were serious, serious problems with the
                    economy. We provided aid under the Government Assistance to Occupied Areas
                    (GAOA) programs immediately after the war and then through the Marshall Plan. In
                    part because of this, we had kept the economy going. Then we made the discovery
                    that really the Austrian economy was in very sound shape. Tourism is also one of
                    the great pluses because this is what put their balance of payments in order in
                    the short run. As Europe began this slow process of recovery, tourism took
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollections of the general magnitude of
                        the U.S. assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES I have full details in the attic. In the immediate post-war years, i.e.,
                    1946-1952, US assistance to Austria was just over a billion dollars, of which
                    $680 million came under the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In our current parlance about graduate countries, was
                        Austria a success?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, the Austrians believe it and we believe it. It worked very, very
                    well for a variety of reasons. To my mind our aid certainly was a necessary
                    condition for the rapid development of Austria, but the predominant reason for
                    Austria's economic success was in the political stability they achieved in sharp
                    contrast to the 1920's and 1930's when civil war had erupted. Another element
                    explaining this success concerned the Austrian economy after annexation by
                    Germany. The Germans considered Austria as an excellent site for much of its war
                    production and invested heavily in these facilities, in steel-making, metal
                    working, and machinery. Many of the investments made by the Germans remained in
                    place after the war.Yet another factor in Austria's economic rapid growth lay in
                    the simple fact that the other European economies had revived, and Austria
                    benefited substantially from growth in demand for its exports and the phenomenal
                    increase in tourism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of technical assistance activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes. A large volume of technical assistance activities, but I knew almost
                    nothing about these. By the time of my arrival in 1953, the volume was
                    declining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Austrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Always instructive. There is a long tradition of imperial power in the
                    Hapsburg Empire, one of the great empires of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I was a program economist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a mission director then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The mission director when I went to Vienna was Clarence Meyer. When he
                    left, Richard McCaffrey took over. Meyer was there for two years of our stay,
                    and McCaffrey for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go on to your next assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Transfer to ECA / London, U.K. - 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>JONNES: My next assignment was to London in 1956, the year of the Suez War that
                    embittered British-American relations. I was transferred from Vienna to London
                    to take a position as an assistant Treasury Attach� in the office of the
                    Treasury, but technically I was part of the ICA mission— there was a small group
                    in London that was closing down the operations of the Marshall Plan and its
                    successor agencies. The justification for our being there at all was to insure a
                    reasonably, orderly conclusion of our operations. I think there were five ECA
                    officers. Two of us were in the Treasury office doing general economic
                    reporting. In point of fact, much of my activity apart from reporting on the
                    balance of payment was concerned with various agreements for contributions by
                    the United States to the British government for support for one or another
                    aspect of the common defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Marshall Plan had ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, the plan had ended in 1952. There were residual activities, however,
                    and by the time I got there they had a number of small programs involved in the
                    sale of our agricultural commodities of one type or another against sterling
                    payment, and the question was then how should the proceeds of these sales be
                    used. We were also very interested in helping the British with their procurement
                    of various types of military equipment, and the financing of this became the
                    subject matter of our day to day operations.There's not really much to be said
                    because I was really outside the mainstream of development work. The mission as
                    such in London was terminated in mid-'57 and all of us except the accountant
                    left. Two of us went to the mission in Libya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of activity was really related to the military
                        procurement and analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: And to the sale of agricultural commodities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And technical assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I had nothing to do with that..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were continuing, but you had nothing to do with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Technical assistance under our aegis was virtually at an end..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't there very long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>JONNES: A year. A very pleasant year in spite of Suez, but an interlude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then how did you suddenly get off to Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The decision was made in Washington that the aid mission in London—and I
                    believe in other European capitals—were to be dissolves. I would have to put
                    that question to the others because I had no idea what precipitated the
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they say anything about the matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. What had been under consideration at that time for both myself and
                    Don Palmer was that we would enter the Foreign Service, but that never worked
                    out for either one of us. Don later went on to IMF.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned to Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assignment in Libya on detail to the Office of the Prime Minister - 1957-8</p>
                <p>JONNES: I was assigned to Libya and detailed to the Office of the Prime Minister
                    to the Development Counsel of the National Government. My job there was to aid
                    and counsel the Libyan government on its development processes. Then most of us
                    were foreigners. The Deputy Chief of the UN Technical Assistance Mission to
                    Libya, a Brit, was the head of the Development Counsel and three of us made up
                    the working staff, two Brits and myself. The Deputy Chief of the Development
                    Counsel was a Libyan whose interest in this subject was definitely limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an ICA mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Oh yes, there was a very large ICA mission, the director of which was
                    Marc Gordon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a project so to speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>JONNES: In a sense, yes, but as a project it was almost impossible. I spent a
                    great deal of time in trying to work through all the economic data, such as
                    there was, for them because this was of course an area the Libyans had not even
                    started to work at. Libya had received its political independence in 1954 after
                    centuries of Ottoman rule and then Italian colonialism from 1911 to 1941.
                    Thereafter, the varying fortunes of war beset the land, and then the UK took it
                    under its wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Libya at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, the political situation was that they were in the early stages of
                    independence and were trying to work out what sort of a place they were. The
                    King was very much in power and their economic situation was in a word
                    impossible They had not yet discovered oil nor did they believe for one second
                    that they had oil. This was in 1957 when we were there and the first major oil
                    was found in the spring of 1958, but I think the outside community realized that
                    oil was coming in.</p>
                <p>The real problem from the U.S. point of view was to make sure that our training
                    facilities, the U.S. air base, remained in place. To this end, our AID mission
                    had two functions: (a) transfer that volume of resources necessary to keep
                    Wheelus airbase operating and secondarily, to see what could possibly be done to
                    help this nation that had never been a nation as such begin its growth. Libya
                    was characterized by a very rudimentary agricultural economy. Principal export
                    items were scrap metal from the war — that is to say, the old tanks that had
                    been left in the desert and esparto grass which is used to make fine writing
                    paper. My concern was what could one do to encourage the Libyans in power to
                    prepare for the coming of oil. What kinds of rational economic policy can one
                    espouse? In retrospect, it was how to prepare for oil. What sort of
                    infrastructure do you put in place? What the Libyans had done up to that time
                    had little or no relevance to what they needed if they were going to become an
                    oil producer. And for practical purposes there was no one to whom one could
                    speak of such matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were aware at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Certainly we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you recommending?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>JONNES: Unhappily, very little. We had a small agricultural development bank, the
                    function of which was to get small loans out to farmers. As you know well, this
                    is one of the toughest ventures in supporting primitive or traditional
                    agriculture because inevitably in this type of society you run right into the
                    local moneylender who not surprisingly has a great deal of political power and
                    has little appetite for change. The problem is large in India as you know. In
                    Libya, we were only a very small part of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get an agricultural development bank off
                        the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We were able to in some small degree, and we put a small amount of
                    American money into it. A major project that the Libyans wanted was the
                    construction of a road to Fezzan, deep in the heart of the desert. This was
                    apparently one of the king's favorite projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Constructing the road?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Constructing the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A road the nowhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In point of fact it turned out to be a road to somewhere, to the capital
                    of the desert province, the Fezzan. As one of the principal investments that the
                    royal family wanted to make, it was related to the regular moves of the capital
                    around the country. The first year we were there the capital was in Tripoli and
                    the next year we were in Benghazi and had we been there a third year, we might
                    have been up in Behda.—we were becoming part of a nomadic society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You actually moved physically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, we moved from Tripoli to Benghazi. Early on I saw there was no need
                    for me to be with the Development Counsel. My British colleagues and I
                    recognized that this was no purpose to our being there as there was no one on
                    the Libyan side to commune with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Largely because of the King's attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES. No. Largely because the Libyan government simply did not function as the
                    charts suggested it might. I moved back into the Mission and became the program
                    officer for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you build that road?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The road was built, and I believe we helped to finance it. As I recall,
                    we had agreed with the Libyans on a structure consisting of two parts for
                    administering aid, the Libyan American Reconstruction Commission that would plan
                    the use of aid funds, and the Joint Services, staffed by Americans, Libyans, and
                    numerous Palestinians, to carry out many of these projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is like the old Joint Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: That's my understanding, that it came out of our experience in Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Same thing in Ethiopia? And this was sort of a shadow
                        government arrangement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: That's right. But in the case of Libya I think it was more than shadow
                    and that was the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Libyan counterpart? The Prime Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I believe it was the Minister of Finance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of other projects other than those did you
                        support....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Reforestation. One of the principal problems along the southern littoral
                    of the Mediterranean of course is that of the control of water. For example
                    knock down, drag-out battles were fought among the foreign advisors as to how
                    one should try to deal with the problem of the wadis (dry gulches that in the
                    rainy season flooded).. One fought and lost and one fought and won and it
                    probably made not too much difference in the long run because the true power of
                    the government was just not interested in these affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much money are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We're talking about 4-5 million dollars a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was support?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>JONNES: Budget support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Budget support. So it was like a direct transfer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have any say about its uses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The funds were channeled through the Libyan-American Reconstruction
                    Commission where at least nominally decisions on the uses were made jointly. But
                    the Libyan culture was, as I have been implying, an inscrutable society for many
                    of us. I don't think we had anybody in the Mission who understood what Libya was
                    and no more than two or three people spoke Arabic, Libya was a very strange
                    place as I've said. It had been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1911. It had
                    then been seized by the Italians and fought over. The Italians moved settlers,
                    colonists, from Sicily into Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. They had their tiny
                    farms right along the road and this was an Italian colony. Libya as such had
                    never existed. In 1954, the UN said it exists as a nation. There was a king,
                    Idris of the Senussi family</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet the King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I met a couple of the princes. In fact we lived right around the
                    corner from one branch of the royal family in Benghazi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any communication with them at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not any. In retrospect it's even more curious. We had nobody who could
                    establish any sort of meaningful link with those people with whom we were
                    supposed to be dealing with one exception, our link with the Ministry of
                    Finance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the government.......</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Our principal contact was The First Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,
                    Shagalouf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the King's representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I had the strong impression that he was.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably he was able to negotiate the grants that
                        somehow achieved our purposes</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: On June 30 at 11:59 p.m. we would be signing agreements for the fiscal
                    year, and fair questions existed as to how meaningfully our Libyan colleagues
                    took these except perhaps in the aggregate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We helped create the university as one of our
                        projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In Benghazi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which American university worked with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm not sure which university was there. It might have been Michigan
                    State, but I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The university was one of our projects that still exists,
                        I guess. Are there other institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the ones you remember having started at
                        least?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: One project that we financed certainly was not one that we had initiated,
                    that of the Tripoli Power, perhaps an institution but one that created more
                    problems than it solved in one respect. The Italians had residual claims to the
                    ownership of Tripoli Power, and if we were going to provide aid to Tripoli
                    Power, in some measure it was to the Italians to whom the benefits would flow.
                    We had a number of soil and water projects. We had horticultural projects,
                    livestock projects. We had a number of participants studying in the United
                    States in general studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Libyans were not that much engaged in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JONNES: That's right. Absolutely. And as I say, there was a large number of
                    Palestinian expatriates who staffed both the Libyan ministries and the joint
                    operating bodies to which we were party.. One can't speak of them as
                    expatriates, but exiles who were very good civil servants, very knowledgeable.
                    The Libyans were not very happy with them, because they believed that they (the
                    Palestinians) should be back in Israel worrying about getting rid of the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were part of the civil service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would be very diffident about speaking of their status. We hired a
                    number of them to work in the Joint Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, there were very few Libyans, true Libyans, engaged
                        in the program. Except for people working with us in the rural or farming
                        areas, students in the university and like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes. It was very discouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you judge the impact our efforts there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, it's difficult to tell. I put this questions to my older son after
                    he had taught at the University of Benghazi in the late 1970's for two years,
                    and he was hard put to it to give me an answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there were a few institutions that did remain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would not be at all surprised if the Libyans went out of their way to
                    ensure that these did not exist, with the possible exception of the university.
                    But as you know our relations with Libya fell apart after Qadhafi took power in
                    1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the short term basis, the programs sort of served our
                        purposes....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Certainly in the aggregate. But, the dynamics of the Ambassador's
                    relationship with the Prime Minister and King I can hardly speak to. And oil was
                    becoming a major theme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it hadn't entered the picture.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>JONNES: They were exploring vigorously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything about the Mission itself in terms of the group
                        you were working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not really. I think I was concerned always about how in heavens name one
                    arrives at rational decisions about the use of resources in Libya. And I spent
                    time trying to persuade our people on the spot and back in Washington that this
                    was a question on which one should focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Libya then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return to Washington and the ICA's Africa/Europe Bureau - 1959</p>
                <p>JONNES: After Libya, I returned to Washington in September, 1959, where I served
                    for two years. Initially, I was in the Program Office of African and European
                    Affairs of ICA and then I took over the Yugoslav, Spanish, Polish desks - in
                    effect the residual programs of Europe. Only the Yugoslav program was not
                    residual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything special in the work that you did at the
                        Program Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, the Harar Report on development in sub-Saharan Africa that was
                    received in the fall of '59, and the question was does this provide a basis for
                    our program operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you might want to comment on the Harar Report?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>JONNES: It was becoming very clear, very quickly that the map of Africa was going
                    to change, that the days of colonialism were coming to an end. What could and
                    should the United States do to make this transition more effective, easier,
                    quicker. Certainly the set of recommendations was aimed at investment in
                    educational facilities and suggested that the aid programs in Africa really had
                    to focus on education in the long run. How this played itself out in the
                    individual countries was to be determined. But here we were in '59 in the
                    closing years of the Eisenhower administration, and my impression was and is
                    that the political support for this type of new emphasis was missing. This was
                    not something that Eisenhower was interested in. We were coming up to the 1960
                    elections. Internally, this was a very interesting report in taking a look at a
                    set of problems that would be with us for a long time. This is something that we
                    should focus on. I'm not sure what the reaction was in the AFE upper
                    echelon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other aspect of your work at the Program Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It was my strong impression that this was a bad time for development
                    assistance. We had lost our administrator from one day to the next. My
                    understanding is that 19 persons had declined the post of head of ICA before
                    James Riddleberger took over. This he did, I assumed, out of a sense of duty as
                    a foreign service officer. He had been involved with the Marshall Plan as the
                    State Department's representative in our European headquarters, the Office of
                    the Special Representative. But he certainly was always interested in ICA, and
                    so here he was as our chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you shifted to the Yugoslav desk....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Then I shifted to the Yugoslav desk where a tremendous amount of activity
                    was going on through our Development Loan Fund and our technical assistance
                    activities. The Yugoslav's had picked up on a number of these with the focus
                    primarily in agriculture. They had worked with a consortium of five mid-western
                    universities, all Land Grant universities, to establish their own research
                    facilities in hybrid corn and animal breeding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what universities were involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I am not sure but believe that the University of Illinois and Iowa State
                    were part of the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially research?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>JONNES: We provided for the long-term training of Yugoslav personnel in genetics
                    - plant genetics and breeding. It provided support in Yugoslavia through
                    demonstration equipment and advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many American technicians in Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not many resident but substantial numbers of personnel on contract or
                    short-term assignment.. We did not have them in the Mission, but there was a
                    great deal of travel back and forth. We also worked with the Yugoslavs in hog
                    farming and they did very well out of this. We used large amounts of counterpart
                    for road building. This is an art which they have still not mastered in
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a lot of counterpart funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, we had large counterpart funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We provided a certain amount of Marshall Plan money in the
                        past.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: That's right. Almost $200 million under the Marshall Plan and just over
                    one billion dollars under the MSA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they had general economic aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, indeed. Because Yugoslavia was one of the pawns in the cold war, and
                    we believed it desirable to support Tito who had had the temerity to challenge
                    Stalin on his own ground as it were.An ancillary activity was support for Poland
                    dating from 1956, basically from the Ex-Im Bank. Curious enough, we also
                    supported a children's hospital in Krakow and this was one of the more unusual
                    activities. This was a project that Mr. Zablocki, the then Chairman of the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly supported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Zablocki?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, it was his Lieblingskind. Senator Hubert Humphrey for that matter
                    was another strong supporter. The two of them were very much in favor of this
                    venture, and it was in fact completed.</p>

                        innovations that we made apart from the hybrid corn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think that most of our aid at that time took the form of projects being
                    financed through the Development Loan Fund.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We thought that they were in the process of working out their political
                    problems, more fools we. That Tito was able for so long to keep these internal,
                    ethnic hostilities under control was most remarkable. We were quite aware that
                    there were deeply-rooted animosities, centuries if not millennia old, among the
                    various ethnic groups. This was not an issue for us at that time. It looked as
                    if there were a greater awareness of the importance of working out their common
                    fate. I don't think any of us working around Yugoslavia could have predicted
                    what has happened. That simply points out the importance of what we talked about
                    earlier. If a country can not work out its internal political problems,
                    everything else becomes almost moot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, basically this was it. I went to Krakow on one occasion to talk with

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose idea was this initially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: This was the idea of a Polish-American by the name of Bernacki-Poray. I
                    don't remember his first name, but this was the family name. He was a rather
                    flamboyant doctor who single-handedly persuaded Zablocki that a children's
                    hospital was just exactly what the United States should be doing to show its
                    concern for Poland. We as the bureaucracy were concerned with one thing. It's
                    all well and good to talk about the use of counterpart (it wasn't technically
                    counterpart, it was PL 480 - local currency under our control). It's one thing
                    to talk about the use of that currency, and it's another thing to talk about the
                    use of dollars. The supporters of the project from the beginning had insisted
                    that no dollar appropriation would be needed, and our concern at every turn of
                    the road was to see that that remained so. But the support that Bernacki-Poray
                    had claimed would be forthcoming from his fund raising efforts never appeared.
                    This failure was papered over by our friends on the Hill and they ended up
                    voting sizable dollar appropriations.</p>

                <p>JONNES: The scale of our contributions - I think we were talking the equivalent
                    of six or seven million dollars in PL 480 local currencies and then ultimately
                    we were talking several million dollars which would require
                    authorization/appropriation action by the Congress.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Political symbol. That's the way Bernacki-Poray sold it, and that's what
                    Clement Zablocki thought it was, and I'm sure Sen. Humphrey thought the
                    same.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Here we are in the late 1950's. The first stirrings of the project
                    occurred in 1956. There had been the Hungarian revolution in 1956, and there
                    were indications that the Poles might go the same way. We were trying to show
                    support for their independence from the Soviet Union through non-violent means,
                    another expression of the Cold War that so dominated our lives.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The US made several loans for large investment projects, and we had a
                    small PL 480 program. The largest loan that the Ex-Im Bank made was finance
                    equipment going into the Nova-Huta Steel Mill just outside Krakow and this
                    became the center piece of the steel industry in Poland. In terms of it's
                    environmental contribution, I guess it almost killed the city of Krakow because
                    of the problem of emissions.</p>

                <p>New role in Paris working with theDevelopment Assistance Committee, OECD -
                    1961</p>
                <p>JONNES: No. I would say that the next assignment in my service with USAID was one
                    of the most interesting periods of my life. We were embarking on a major effort
                    in Paris to persuade our European friends that they should share in the cost of
                    providing more development assistance. and that they should be taking a far more
                    positive, far more active, far more aggressive role in the efforts to deal with
                    the problems of the third world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>JONNES: This was 1961. In October I moved to Paris on assignment. The OECD had
                    just come into being as the successor agency to the OECD. The latter had been
                    the central administrative agency for the Europeans for the Marshall Plan, i.
                    e., it had been the point at which the Europeans undertook all major substantive
                    discussions about the amounts of aid and terms of aid and conditions thereof for
                    the Marshall Plan. In the years following the Marshall Plan as such, the OECD
                    was preoccupied with the evolution of economic development within Europe and
                    with all the manifold problems that came out of that. In addition of course, the
                    European Economic Community had come into being—in 1955 or '56— with its
                    headquarters in Brussels. I think it likely that the latter development
                    diminished the OECD considerably. But the OECD from the American point of view
                    was the primary institution where we could engage the Europeans in general
                    economic discussions.In 1961 occurred the transformation of the OECD into the
                    OECD (with the US becoming an official member) that also provided for the
                    inclusion of the Development Assistance Committee, previously an ad hoc body, in
                    the organization and added a new dimension to its economic work. The Committee
                    was made up of members who were providing development assistance to the third
                    world. That meant the British, the Germans, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians,
                    the Scandinavians, the Italians, the Portuguese, ourselves and later, the
                    Japanese.The primary questions that underlay our business were those arising
                    from our respective views of how much development aid should be given, to whom
                    it should be given, and who should be giving it.The first problem was to define
                    more rigorously the term, Official Development Assistance, and then determine
                    who actually was giving aid . So for the first year or so we embarked on
                    something of an exploratory expedition to define aid and begin to collect the
                    statistic. We finally reached a consensus that development assistance should
                    represent the transfer of financial resources at subsidized interest rates at
                    longer term for the economic and social development of the recipient. That is to
                    say, there should be a subsidy, i. e., the resources should be at an interest
                    rate below the market rate, and it should be designed to help in the development
                    process of the country that was receiving the resources.At the same time,
                    questions arose on how we could best focus the energies and the resources of our
                    governments as aid donors on particular problems of the less developed world.
                    Initially, we thought in terms obviously of the individual recipient. At the
                    same time we were confronting these problems, the World Bank was beginning to
                    set up its systems of consortia and consultative groups. Then, too, the OECD was
                    beginning to address the development problems of its poorer members,
                    specifically Turkey and Greece, by setting up consortia of aid giving members.
                    In the DAC we also undertook reviews both of the need for aid by region of the
                    third world and a review of how these needs were being met by each individual
                    donor's efforts.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Ambassador James Riddleberger who had been head of ICA, as well as our
                    Ambassador to Yugoslavia and Greece, was the first head of the Development
                    Assistance Committee. He was followed by Willard Thorp, a distinguished
                    economist out of Amherst College who had been active in Washington over the
                    years dealing with various economic problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The technical title of that position was advisor in the US delegation to
                    the OECD. Initially, we had a small group directly under Ambassador Tuthill.
                    Seymour Rubin, who had been the general counsel of AID joined us in the spring
                    of 1962 as the US representative to the Development Assistance Committee.I think
                    there were perhaps five of us who served as advisors on the delegation. He was
                    succeeded a year and a half later by Frank Coffin who had been congressman from
                    Maine and then had been one of the persons most active in setting up AID. I
                    think Frank also served briefly as the deputy administrator of AID. I'm not sure
                    how long his assignment was, but anyway he came to Paris two or three months
                    before I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the other donors providing a lot of assistance at

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: That was one point we had some difficulty agreeing on. It provided us
                    with a whole maze of questions as to what type of financial resources might be
                    regarded as development assistance. And of course every government that was
                    providing financial resources to any less developed nation was delighted to have
                    that defined as development assistance even if the resources were not going to
                    development assistance. We were by the very nature the organization compelled to
                    take a looser view of the transfer of resources rather than a you or I might
                    have done if left to our own judgments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the trickiest issues in that aspect
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>JONNES: For us there was a question as to whether resources that we transferred
                    to Israel actually constituted development assistance. There was a fair question
                    as to whether Israel was in any sense a less developed country. Certainly in my
                    eyes, it is not. And there was a question as to the purposes of the aid.Another
                    of the more difficult questions was that of French aid to the former French
                    territories in Africa. How should one treat the transfer of resources that had
                    been agreed to perhaps as part of the ending of colonialism, i.e. that had been
                    agreed when the countries achieved their independence? Much of these resources
                    undoubtedly went to meet the operational costs of the government. Would that be
                    development assistance?Quite apart from the more narrow issue of resource
                    transfer, there was an unending preoccupation with the more general policies
                    that we as donors should guide on in administering aid. I think that those of us
                    in the business of development didn't realize how difficult the transition from
                    newly achieved political independence by a traditional society to a modern,
                    independent industrial power really is, nor did we appreciate the absolute
                    essential point that these nations to become nations ultimately had to reach a
                    degree of stability in their political structure. This is perhaps another way of
                    saying that above all how these nations had to learn how to transfer domestic
                    political power over the years without undoing all of the political and economic
                    progress already achieved Over the past fifty years, as we know, so many of them
                    just have failed utterly in this process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've always understood that the U.S. objective in forming
                        the DAC was to get the other donors to put up more aid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Certainly that was the proximate reason for our pressing for the DAC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you successful in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would suggest that we were. The data show that over the first ten years
                    of DAC's existence, there was an increase of some forty-six percent. The
                    increment reflected sharp increases in the aid programs of Germany, Japan, the
                    Nordic nations, and the Dutch. There were of course other factors at work, not
                    least of all our bilateral approaches to other donors, but the mild pressures
                    exerted there in Paris surely contributed to the result. The burden-sharing
                    exercise also reflected these changes, that in 1960, the US provided some
                    fifty-seven percent of total Official Development Assistance from DAC members;
                    in 1970, about forty-five percent. Bear in mind that these are rather
                    simple-minded comparisons, but they do point to a conclusion that we were not
                    working in vain. One of the small monuments to the activities of the Development
                    Assistance Committee was the annual report by the chairman. It was truly a
                    report by the Chairman but it also included all of the data we could agree to
                    publish.. This became one of the more valuable documents for the development
                    community over the next decades.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think the ideological differences in the approaches to development came
                    a little bit later, that we were still in the beginning stages of thinking
                    seriously as national aid donors, were just beginning to think about aid
                    doctrine. Such issues as where should the emphasis in allocation of resources to
                    an aid recipient be, What should be the emphasis put upon the pattern of
                    government expenditures. What should these governments in these countries be
                    doing. Where do you put money in education. Where do you put your money in
                    agriculture. I think it took a long time for doctrines to emerge and the debate
                    on these doctrines had really just begun between the Europeans and ourselves.
                    The Europeans were far more relaxed on the questions of private versus public
                    ventures so far as investment in productive enterprises were concerned. This
                    probably reflected the European experience over the years on public investment
                    versus private. Quite frequently they through “force majeur” found themselves as
                    governments running major industrial complexes because of the circumstances
                    induced by World War II.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time the U. S. was the largest donor in terms of
                        the ratio of aid to GNP?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. We were at the average in 1960 and a little bit below ten years later
                    and always below what we had in the DAC set as our goal, 0.7% of GNP. The former
                    colonial powers in Africa—France, Portugal, Belgium—had the largest share.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the DAC relate to the developing countries? It has
                        always been my experience that they didn't really interact as a group. Is
                        that fair or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>JONNES: As concerns the early stages of the DAC, it is not fair, but in a real
                    sense we were experimenting as to how best to approach the aid-giving process.
                    No, that's not fair. When we met to consider regional problems in parts of
                    Africa, Asia, Latin America, we normally had representatives of the governments
                    in the region joining us to simply talk about their problems. There were
                    sessions for the exchange of information and for our education rather than aid
                    giving sessions. You have to remember that in the early 1960's most of the
                    African countries had just become independent. We were really on the threshold
                    of international development as a concept. So we had, for example, one large
                    session with the East African Community, the three countries and the body of
                    common services for Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. We had representatives from the
                    three governments present. These were larger sessions. I think that in terms of
                    education, not only for us but above all for many of the Europeans these were
                    most useful. In any event, East Africa didn't turn out the way we thought it
                    would turn out. We had sessions with the government of Thailand, sessions with
                    the Taiwanese. We had one session with the Latin American countries but they
                    seemed well beyond this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have country reviews at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We had the country reviews of our members' aid programs, but not of the
                    development progress of the aid recipients. In the former case this technique
                    was the chosen technique of the OECD when the organization was examining the
                    economic growth of its members. We simply borrowed the technique and applied it
                    to the broad question to each member, how is your development assistance effort
                    doing. The aid policy makers of the particular country would come to Paris and
                    would explain what was happening in their countries and what they expected to be
                    doing and they would be queried carefully and closely and on occasion very
                    sharply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an annual event?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues you recall of the countries
                        review of the U.S. program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>JONNES: That's a very good question. In 1961-62-63-64, we were perhaps at the
                    strongest point in our aid programs arithmetically, and our European friends
                    were concerned always about the level of assistance to Israel. Later, the same
                    question would arise about our supporting assistance programs, above all that in
                    Vietnam. The Europeans were very much interested in our experience with
                    questions such as at what point do you get out of the aid business, how to you
                    determine when you're successful, how do you deal with questions of those policy
                    changes that the recipient governments should make if the aid is to be
                    successful. I think a considerable part of the DAC's discussions at that time
                    had its focus upon exchanges of donor experience. The smaller European countries
                    had no desire to set up large aid organizations such as we had and they were
                    constantly querying about how one can do the aid business more effectively and
                    more rationally. “And what do you Americans think as you go through this
                    process. How can you help us.” There wasn't much criticism of the U.S. aid
                    effort. We were doing much and were ahead of the game. That criticism came later
                    I suppose. Q. Was there any attempt on our part to justify our levels of maybe
                    not being as great as they could be because we were providing military
                    assistance? Was there a discussion on that?</p>
                <p>JONNES: So far as I recall, there was very little of that. That too came much
                    later, particularly in the context of Vietnam when so much of our development
                    assistance was going to Vietnam and some Europeans considered our support to
                    Vietnam as inexplicably large quite apart from not being development assistance.
                    Our efforts to have military expenditures wrapped into a burden-sharing exercise
                    were at best inchoate so far as I can remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular topics you were personally
                        working on or concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I worked across the board in arranging for the American participation in
                    the regional and country discussions. I worked on the statistical side with the
                    OECD personnel who were really very, very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: DAC had its own staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: DAC had a small staff as part of the secretariat of the OECD. Yes, that's
                    correct. And we had several Americans who were on staff there. For example,
                    Sherwood Fine was the head of that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was very heavily American influenced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I would say if anything, the US was under-represented. Sherwood was
                    there but there were very few Americans beyond him. There were many Germans,
                    British, French, Scandinavians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well the Secretary General of the OECD was Kristensen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of the staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The chief of the staff office working on development matters was Sherwood
                    and then the Chairman of DAC was American, so those two positions were ours. But
                    the Chairman had no direct, operational responsibility for the OECD staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a matter of tradition that the chairman should
                        always be an American?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, there was an understanding that an American would be the chairman
                    and a Frenchman would be the deputy. And I think that's held until this day, as
                    a matter of fact. I would simply note that subsequently, some fourteen or
                    thirteen years later I went back to Paris as the U.S. representative to the DAC
                    for what turned out to be another three years stint. And at that time I devoted
                    some of my energies to trying to persuade my colleagues that the time had come
                    to close down the DAC, but I will come back to that period later in this
                    talk.</p>
                <p>USAID/Turkey as Program Officer-Economist - 1964-67</p>
                <p>JONNES: Let me pick this up later on if that's all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>But from Paris, quite unexpectedly, I was transferred to Turkey to be the program
                    officer and economist at the AID mission there. The assignment proved to be a
                    remarkable three-year period. A new mission director, James Grant, an
                    extraordinarily energetic, intelligent person. The work in Turkey was in every
                    sense of the word development work. We had a very large aid program there, both
                    in technical assistance and in large investments. The Turks were in the third
                    year following a military coup a coup that had been precipitated by Turkey's
                    national bankruptcy at the end of the 1950's as a consequence of remarkably
                    irrational economic policies. The military had intervened in 1960, had deposed
                    the prime minister, foreign minister and finance minister and ultimately had
                    executed the three men.By 1964 they, the Turks, were in the midst of an
                    intensive period of development planning. They had a national development plan
                    in place. They had called upon the OECD and then the OECD to help them make this
                    transition out of bankruptcy and into more powerful development. The OECD had
                    agreed to do this, setting up a consortium of aid donors to help Turkey
                    directly. Also of great interest the OECD had concluded a massive study of
                    Turkey's public investment policies, particularly in their state enterprises.
                    These policies had been one of the principal causes of their economic woes.When
                    Ataturk took power in 1922, Turkey was truly an undeveloped, agricultural
                    economy. He, Ataturk, and his colleagues were very much concerned to begin to
                    put into place a modern industrial economy. At that time when they looked around
                    for models, there were the Italians, there were the Russians, both of whom put
                    tremendous emphasis of course on public ownership of productive facilities. This
                    was the route that Ataturk followed generally in the manufacturing sector of the
                    economy. And their experiences here were in financial terms disastrous because
                    whatever the branch of industry: sugar, textiles, machine tools, tires, you name
                    the branch of industry, they followed monopolistic, dirigistic policies to the
                    point that the manufacturing sector had become one of the driving forces of
                    their bankruptcy.The OECD did a series of studies for them in 1960-61, producing
                    a set of recommendations for the government to follow. The government agreed to
                    do it, made a series of institutional changes, but they still did not really do
                    away with the state economic enterprises. So the major player in the Turkish
                    economy was the Turkish government so far as production was concerned.And this
                    was a continuing problem.</p>
                <p>We as an AID mission had a variety of priorities. We were helping in the
                    financing of new power sources, most notably, the large dam on the Euphrates,
                    the Keban Dam. The European Investment Bank and several of the European
                    governments were also involved in its financing. We were concerned to help the
                    Turks move away from the government as the economic entrepreneur, using various
                    devices: by setting up sub-lending organizations for private entrepreneurs, by
                    encouraging the investment banks to do more lending to private entrepreneurs.
                    But at the same time we had substantial technical assistance in education with
                    the objective of providing the Turks with well-trained business people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the level of resources there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>JONNES: As I recall that the US government was providing about $200 million a
                    year, including the technical assistance program, PL 480, and development
                    lending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was PL 480 money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes. One of our principal objects was to make sure that the consortium
                    was working. So one consequence of this was that I spent a great deal of time
                    working with the secretary and with the chairman of the consortium. The latter's
                    chairman was a German, Herr von Mangoldt, and the executive secretary was an
                    American, Walter Stettner. They headquartered in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the World Bank was not down there in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not at that time, as their relationship had suffered during the anguish
                    of Turkey's bankruptcy.. But in a real sense, we were helping the Turks in
                    reestablishing their nation's international economic status, not only with new
                    aid but through restructuring their external indebtedness.At the time it seemed
                    to us for a variety of reasons that on quite moderate assumptions Turkey had it
                    within its power over the following five years to reach effective
                    self-sustaining growth.One of the underlying assumptions had absolutely nothing
                    to do with anything we had ever done. Rather, it arose from the construction in
                    1961 of the Berlin wall, the wall between East and West Germanies. The wall
                    stopped the flow of refugees from the East to the West, and the Germans had to
                    start looking elsewhere for large numbers of workers they needed in their
                    expanding economy. One major source was Turkey. By 1964 the Germans already had
                    more than a million Turks there. Among the questions this presence raised was
                    “What about the transfer of the financial earnings of these workers back to
                    their loved ones in Turkey?” And this quickly became a major source of foreign
                    exchange for the Turks, foreign exchange that eased many of their external
                    financing problems.</p>
                <p>Beyond this windfall, Turkish exports were doing very well, they were beginning
                    to produce good quality textiles at more than reasonable prices and they were
                    making life very difficult for other producers in the European markets. And much
                    of the textile production was actually private. The tourism industry was
                    beginning to grow rapidly. The Europeans were beginning to realize that Turkey
                    was just a marvelous place to find the sun and find a cheap holiday.Thus, it
                    seemed to us that within five years or so the Turks should be in a position to
                    reach a position of de facto economic independence. And in point of fact, lo and
                    behold by 1971, they were in any technical sense, that their foreign exchange
                    situation and balance of payments were in order. They managed to undo their
                    success because of their own internal political problems, including a great
                    measure of domestic terrorism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working with the Turks at that time? JONNES: It
                        was very satisfactory. We succeeded in establishing excellent working
                        relations with the senior economic people, with the officials of the
                        Ministry of Finance, and with people in the private sector. In any event,
                        our first chore was to persuade the Turks we were there to help in the
                        development process. Our concern was also to make it possible for our
                        military cooperation to continue, but we had shifted the emphasis, and they
                        had confidence in this.</hi>

                <p>JONNES: Our primary interest always was to make sure that the Turks were there to
                    hold the right wing of NATO. Remember, we're still in the middle of the Cold
                    War, We had, as you know, major radar bases, listening posts, all over Turkey,
                    and at least until the Cuban missile crisis in '62, we had missiles in
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the bases reflect a major transfer of resources to
                        Turkey or was it not really? The fact that we had our bases there must have
                        meant a large flow of funds into the Turkish economy.</hi>

                <p>JONNES: I'm not sure that's correct. The American troop presence was minimal. In
                    fact thinking back on the balance of payments calculation, I think the earnings
                    if you will from the American presence were small. So many of the bases were out
                    in the true backwoods where there was little or nothing for the troops to
                    buy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Turks consider our economic assistance a quid pro
                        quo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I don't really know how they thought of it. The people with whom we
                    worked in the ministry of finance, and in the planning organization and with the
                    prime minister took our aid as an effort to get them over their difficulties, to
                    make their transition to a more modern economy. Now, many of the Europeans at
                    the time were members of the consortium. The Economic Community had concluded
                    agreements with the Turks under which Turkey had associate membership in the
                    Community. But although there were dates given for when this would proceed
                    toward full membership, it's significant that here we are in 1998 and the Turks
                    are still not full members. The transitional phase was loosely defined. But the
                    point I”m making is that most of us working on economic matters with the Turks
                    were reasonably confident that the nation was within striking distance of
                    self-sustaining growth and that this in and of itself was a reasonable
                    justification for helping the Turks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not really. As always, the larger numbers are working on technical
                    assistance which is very labor intensive, working on support of the Middle-east
                    Technical University at Ankara, working on a series of schools to support
                    commercial skills: accounting, all the business skills. Public health programs,
                    particularly family planning programs, which I guess are now a no-no on our
                    side. The population growth in Turkey was on the average of 3 percent per annum,
                    and the country is still growing. Working on public administration. That was
                    part of the work at the middle-east technical university on public
                    administration. We had contracts with Cornell, contracts with Michigan
                    State.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Thirty years later, that is a difficult question, and I don't think I can
                    really even try to answer it.Let me go in a different direction. One curious
                    aspect of Turkey at that time was that Islamic fundamentalism had not really
                    begun to show itself. It was very clear there was a problem with the Kurdish
                    minority, but even those problems had not yet really begun to surface except
                    that the population was moving in large numbers into the cities, and a lot of
                    people who were moving into the cities, into Izmir and into Istanbul were from
                    the far eastern part of Turkey where the Kurds are. As the Kurds moved in it was
                    very clear that their customs differed considerably from the customs of their
                    Turkish fellows in the cities. The Kurds tended to solve their problems with
                    violence rather than words, and therein lay the origins of serious problems ten
                    years down the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working mainly on macroeconomic issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Mainly on macroeconomic issues, working mainly on making sure the
                    consortium was in good shape, and of course always working with our friends in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much concern about these parastatals and the
                        need to privatize these big corporations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, quite a bit of emphasis on this out of our Washington offices. As I
                    noted before there had been this tremendous work that the OECD people had put in
                    just before the change to the OECD, this survey of the state economic
                    enterprises and recommendations for dealing with the problems that they
                    perceived in the state economic enterprises.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were those addressed, were there some changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Oh yes, they had created a new state investment bank that was to keep
                    very careful tabs on the financing and the P and L lines of the companies. A
                    major problem had been that nobody really knew what was going on in the
                    individual firms. These firms were also highly politicized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we able to persuade them to spin them off into
                        private...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It would be a fascinating study, one I'd be delighted to do, to go back
                    now and see what actually happened. It's very clear now that the last thirty
                    -five years changed the nature of these enterprises. There has been the
                    emergence of a large entrepreneurial class in Turkey now. And this whole
                    question became one of the central political questions of the Turks. Suleyman
                    Demirel became prime minister, (today he is the president of Turkey), in 1965,
                    having made the problem of the state enterprises one of his rallying cries of
                    the election. He was saying, “Look at these incredible misinvestments that we
                    have made over the years, that we are getting nothing out of them except maybe
                    some jobs, but we're getting nothing out of them in terms of economic return.
                    And this is a situation that cannot continue if Turkey is going to be
                    economically viable.” He won the election. But how fast and to what extent the
                    effective role of the state enterprises changed is quite a different matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you consider Turkey then one of our successes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'd certainly consider it one of our successes, but there were obviously
                    elements there that we never took into account, such as the problems with ethnic
                    groups, the Kurds and the growth of Islamic fundamentalism, all of which have
                    had powerful effects on Turkey's economic growth. Yet those are problems we of
                    the US are hardly in a position to speak to, let alone help in devising
                    solutions. They went through a terrible time in the mid to late 70's that
                    brought yet another military intervention. Terrorism was running rampant, and I
                    think, as a personal opinion, that this terrorism was in large part Kurdish in
                    origin.. It was billed as a leftish - rightish tug of war, but I think it had a
                    great deal to do with the Kurds. My wife and I visited Turkey in 1979, and the
                    country was truly falling apart. Within the year they had a coup. It seems
                    almost every ten years this happens. And now one sees the emergence of a major
                    Islamic fundamentalist movement, and where this is going to lead Turkey I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was in any way a reaction to the
                        development that was taking place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>JONNES: Probably in some part, but this I just don't know. My hunch would be that
                    as the Turkish economy grew, and it has grown, as Turkey became increasingly
                    associated with the European economy, the benefits of this were simply just not
                    that visible to everybody. At no time did Ataturk really succeed in breaking the
                    century-long lifestyle of the people in the back country, in the villages. They
                    certainly admired Ataturk as the conquering general but when he sought to remove
                    religion from state control, when he abolished the Caliphate and banished them,
                    he never persuaded the villagers that they should abandon their religion, and
                    the conflict between the villagers and the central government I think has grown
                    because of this, that the villagers have been left behind in the social
                    development process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were much of our programs or efforts, or the government
                        program concerned with the villages...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I'm talking about how the Turkish economy has moved long since we had
                    anything to do with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time were our programs at all oriented toward
                        ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We had done a great deal in the early years of our program to help
                    agriculture, particularly by providing machinery for wheat farming, by building
                    or financing the construction of the whole system for moving wheat to market,
                    but the level of rainfall in Turkey is, certainly up on the plateau, about 15
                    inches a year, and this is just at the break point, if you miss a little bit why
                    you're in real trouble. One might almost think of our history out on the great
                    plains, it's almost exactly the same, where you get about 15 inches of rain a
                    year, but some years you get less, and when you get less you are in serious
                    trouble. This happens there in Anatolia, and what can one say. Let me go back to
                    one of your earlier questions. Certainly one of our most successful technical
                    assistance operations I think is that in the field of transportation, highway
                    construction and management of highway transportation. Our help came in large
                    part in the 1950's and led to an excellent system of roads in the country, and
                    even more importantly, a bureaucracy that could deal with maintenance of these
                    roads. Now here in the District of Columbia we have the difficulty of
                    understanding the need for maintenance of facilities! But the Turks managed to
                    get this early on, at least for the highway system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our ideas of rural development, community
                        development, not considered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well you're talking about a large country with some ethnic problems. I
                    think the Turkish interest in helping with the development of the Kurdish
                    villages was minimal, and for many years the Turks simply would deny that there
                    was any Kurdish population.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about areas outside that were not Kurdish areas? Was
                        there much concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not too much. Of course the Turkish military gathered in through the
                    draft many of the young men from the villages. Some of the people from the
                    villages also went to Germany to work. The exposure to the outside world through
                    these sources would be considerable, but still today, the Turkish village is
                    still caught in time and can be an extraordinary mix of new technology and
                    age-old primitive practices. To say the least, it's not at all a simple matter.
                    We as the United States did not have, as I recall, any major village development
                    programs. There were studies being done by sociologists, but these were not in
                    my time translated into programs of any sort..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the health programs, the population programs, they
                        were all mostly urban-centered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not really, for the Turks were beginning to try to reach out with small
                    health clinics in the villages...There were Johns Hopkins people in the public
                    health sector. Obviously if you're going to run a national family planning
                    program, you have to have a system and in Turkey village clinics were under
                    consideration. I do not know what happened finally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any institutions that you know about today that
                        were essentially started through the AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Of course. The highway administration for example is one. The Hajatepi
                    Hospital in Ankara which received large amounts of American counterpart was
                    headed by, close to a genius, who persuaded so many of the Turkish doctors who
                    had trained in America to come back from the States and work in Turkey, which
                    was a major sales job. The Middle-east Technical University in Ankara . The iron
                    and steel industry in Turkey is a direct consequence of our investment and
                    counsel. Both the DSI and the Toprak Su agencies, dealing with the management of
                    water and soil conservation were strongly supported by the US and are an
                    essential element of the Turkish government.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>One of the more fascinating aspects of working in Turkey was that one constantly
                    bumped into Turkish pessimism. They had been of course at one time the
                    conquerors and rulers of part of Europe and Africa. They were in Vienna twice,
                    in 1525 and 1683. They possessed a mighty empire, and then it began to ebb.. In
                    the nineteenth century, the nation became the “sick man of Europe.” For much of
                    the twentieth century they have been plagued with, “How do we deal with our
                    national fate?”Ataturk's genius was in a sense similar to that of Washington's
                    as he insisted that Turkey was Anatolia and the Turks should accept this as
                    their national territory and avoid entangling foreign alliances. He made it
                    possible for the Turks intellectually to accept that they were not the Ottoman
                    empire anymore. Today Anatolia is the heartland of Turkey, but in earlier
                    centuries Anatolia was nothing. He taught them to, with the possible exception
                    of Cyprus, not to be involved in foreign adventures. And this was one of the
                    keynotes of his genius. But so many of the Turks when they look outside, when
                    they look at the European nations and look at us, they have this deeply rooted
                    pessimism. And I think that if we in the AID Mission did nothing else we managed
                    to communicate some degree of optimism to our Turkish friends about their
                    future, and to persuade them that there was no objective reason for them to
                    consider themselves in such a pessimistic way. “You can make it. You have it
                    within your own power. You're doing it.”</p>

                    weekly luncheon of the Harvard Development Advisory Service. One could take
                    courses with all of the giants in the field of economic growth. I found myself
                    in a one on one course with Simon Kuznets.I took an accounting course over at
                    the business school. I took probability theory from the mathematical people. I
                    sat in on courses with Ed Mason, and Tom Shelling, and Wally Falcon. It was
                    overwhelming. And that one had time to read simply added to pleasures. I have
                    four notebooks upstairs filled with the results of my work..</p>

                <p>JONNES: I wrote a paper considering the role of foreign trade in the development
                    process. Hollis Chenery was there of course. It was an incredible collection of
                    personalities at Harvard. Henry Kissinger was one of the faculty members working
                    with the Center, and he lectured or had three seminars with us, which were a
                    great pleasure.</p>

                <p>JONNES: The basic message was that while the process for every country is by
                    definition unique, and difficult beyond measure, development is possible.
                    Curiously enough though, I think that even there at Harvard, at the Center and
                    at the Development Advisory Service, they weren't thinking that deeply in terms
                    of the time it takes to work out the political strains and problems incidental
                    to the achievement of even a modicum of economic and social modernization.</p>

                <p>Assignment to Saigon, Vietnam, as Economic Counselor of theEmbassy and the
                    program officer-economist of the AID Mission—1968-69</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>JONNES: In '68 I was assigned to Saigon for a year as the economic counselor at
                    the embassy and as the program officer/planner for the AID mission. That was
                    quite a different world. I arrived in Vietnam about the first of August, 1968,
                    to take on the dual position and found myself almost immediately in the middle
                    of the fourth wave of the TET offensive, the first one having been the very end
                    of January that year. Two more followed, and yet a fourth, each weaker than the
                    preceding one. Nevertheless it gave me once again a taste of war. As I
                    mentioned, I had been an infantryman in World War II and it was in a perverse
                    sense going home, but not a home I particularly liked.The responsibilities that
                    I had in Vietnam were two-fold: one, to seek to ensure that the South Vietnamese
                    government maintained reasonable economic policies that above all restrained
                    inflation, for hyperinflation could have undone all of the efforts to sustain
                    the South Vietnamese nation; two, to help direct whatever the United States
                    could do to speed the processes of economic development in the middle of
                    wartime. The Vietnamese economy was of course a typical dual economy, so typical
                    of the less developed world, that most of the output was agriculture, and there
                    was a very, very thin industrial/processing/handicraft/trade sector.Let me back
                    up. I would underline that the principal concern of my office was to ensure that
                    the price of rice remained relatively constant. And this necessitated that one
                    had available emergency supplies of rice, but it also entailed constant
                    surveillance of what was going on in rice production in the country, because one
                    did not want to completely destroy the local agriculture economy by throwing
                    large quantities of imported rice on the market. On the other hand, if the
                    progress of the war was such that it physically threatened domestic rice
                    production, one had to be in a position to provide food supplies on a large
                    scale almost immediately.So much of the year I was in Vietnam was spent moving
                    around particularly in the Mekong delta, constantly checking on what was going
                    on in the rice market, what was going on in the production side of rice. A
                    mundane economic problem and yet at times a very exciting process, because one
                    was working really in the middle of a war. Where we were out beyond the sound of
                    artillery, one could regularly hear the B-52's working off in the distance, a
                    formidable sound. And at night on the outskirts of Saigon the war was present.
                    One could go on the roof of our building and see the gunships operating and see
                    the flares go up and hear the sounds of shooting. Such a setting, if I may
                    understate a bit, tends to prejudice the process of development, if only because
                    physical security is a necessary condition. I also spent a great deal of time in
                    talking with reporters and visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Further on the rice, what were the factors and how did
                        production....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In the year I was there I was very fortunate that domestic rice
                    production was doing very well in spite of all four TET offensives. Rice was
                    moving into the market, and one may assume the price was such that the farmers
                    were willing to move to sell their rice. But this was a constantly shifting
                    equation, and one simply had to be aware of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you providing assistance to the rice growers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>JONNES: Yes we were providing all sorts of assistance. Above all we were trying
                    to provide security through the military, and trying to make available the
                    traditional inputs, trying to ensure that credit was available to the villagers.
                    We were also launching the introduction of some new varieties of rice, but this
                    was a very tricky matter because of the traditional pattern of consumer tastes;
                    the city people were unwilling to use the new rice because it didn't have quite
                    the right consistency.One of the key questions in this equation of inflation was
                    that of the wage level that the U.S. forces paid to its Vietnamese employees.
                    This became curiously enough one of the great policy issues that we
                    macroeconomic workers had to cope with because the U.S. DOD was not particularly
                    concerned with price levels as such. Their concern was to make sure that they
                    had employees who were willing to do the many jobs that needed doing for them,
                    and what they had to pay was really irrelevant to them. For the South Vietnamese
                    economy, the level of these salary levels was a critical determinant of what was
                    going to happen to the GOVN's budget. It became almost impossible to persuade
                    the Department of Defense of the unhappy aspects of their wage policy, but the
                    time that was spent arguing with them in Saigon and back in Washington was
                    incredible in retrospect.I would say that we fought a successful delaying action
                    time and time again, but ultimately the Department of Defense was not to be
                    deterred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there inflation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The year I was there, for practical purposes, no. The price increases for
                    consumers may have been within five percent. But because rice problems were
                    being kept in hand, and because we kept the Department of Defense at bay, as it
                    were, we were successful in the short run; in the longer run we were much less
                    successful I think. In mid-winter of '68-'69 I had a long chat with the prime
                    minister who was persuaded that the problem of inflation was really the American
                    fault, that the patterns of consumption that the Americans showed to the
                    Vietnamese were a stimulus to ever-growing consumption by the Vietnamese. He
                    felt that the psychology of this was the critical question, that one need not
                    worry so much about what was being paid to the Vietnamese by the U.S. or what
                    might happen to the Vietnamese budget. So in a sense I got little support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm sure there was a psychological impact of the pattern of consumption
                    by the Americans. How much this effected the price level is almost anyone's
                    guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem, what was the issue then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>JONNES: We were just chatting about the psychology of inflation, how he felt it
                    was inevitable simply because of our presence. But then war by its very nature
                    is inflationary. He was suggesting a much more passive position on dealing with
                    the problem. The government itself had of course a swollen bureaucracy because
                    of the war, and their wage policy was a major determinant of price increases. If
                    they felt that their budget deficit was going to be underwritten by the United
                    States, there was no reason for them to exert any discipline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a debate with the government also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We had a debate with the government, but this was much less serious
                    because you never knew to what extent you were being successful in your
                    communicating. So if they tended to feel the issue was irrelevant because of the
                    simple fact of our presence, their interest in any action would be equally
                    irrelevant.The other half of my duties were those to which I devoted much less
                    time, i.e.: what could and should the United States do to encourage, to
                    stimulate, to help with the process of longer term economic development in
                    Vietnam.We had a very large AID mission in the country, about 2,500 people,
                    American officers who were focusing on what was happening at the village level.
                    And we had our people in each of the four regions. AID representatives in each
                    of the four regions responsible for conducting those programs of education,
                    village health and general community development that would support the further
                    thrust of development. The program office staff concerned with these programs
                    ranged at about 225 people. Essentially Jim Roush, who was my deputy for the
                    programming side, looked after these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What all were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: They were concerned with transportation systems, they were concerned with
                    various agricultural programs I mentioned, they were concerned with public
                    health, they were concerned at the national level with educational programs, of
                    public administration. All of the more typical development undertakings that AID
                    had sponsored over the years. We did a great deal of teacher education in
                    Vietnam as I recall. Perhaps this sort of detail I can get as we come back
                    through it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think they were effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Everything we did probably had its effectiveness severely reduced by the
                    simple fact of war. There was hardly an area in Vietnam that was not being
                    touched one way or another by direct war or by the indirect effects of the war.
                    The Viet Cong was almost ubiquitous. The problems of village security were in a
                    word overwhelming. And how one can encourage or work with the people in the
                    villages under these circumstances was a constant problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sense of lasting effects? Obviously you
                        were only there a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: This was a short term assignment for me. In the longer run we obviously
                    didn't succeed because of factors having precious little to do with what we were
                    up to. My own feeling was one of disaffection with the process because my
                    judgment had been that the United States had erred in its policies toward
                    Indochina in the mid-1950s at the time when the Geneva Accord was concluded.
                    That was the moment to have agreed to a political solution, but the United
                    States saw fit not to sign the accord and not to support the process of
                    electoral resolution of the political problems of Indochina. My appreciation of
                    French colonialism was never very high, and the prices we have paid in truckling
                    to French colonialists in the name of anti-Communist were a bit high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view about the policies that were
                        implemented at the time you were there, the general policy toward
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, I thought probably it was doomed to failure. Having long since
                    concluded that we had gone in the wrong direction, I simply gritted my teeth and
                    focused on the suboptimal problem of short term economic evolution of the
                    country. Another possible way out would have been, after the events in 1963 and
                    the virtual revolving door leadership of Vietnam following the killing of the
                    Nhus, to negotiate then. And who knows what might have happened had Kennedy
                    survived. He survived the assassination of Diem in Vietnam by only two weeks I
                    guess. It was a very unhappy time.In retrospect, one of the more powerful shocks
                    of my life was the discovery of the grave misgivings that McNamara had about our
                    policies there that led him out of DOD and the similar problems that led to
                    Clark Clifford's disaffection. If the Secretaries of Defense are opposed to our
                    policies, what are the civil servants, not to mention the US citizenry, to think
                    of these policies.. There I was worrying about precisely the same things as they
                    were. Domestic political events in 1968-9 were extraordinary. President Johnson
                    became a political prisoner; he could go nowhere in the country of which he was
                    president.</p>

                    should be in this position I was in, feeling about the general venture as I did.
                    In fact I had long since expressed views to the head of the Vietnam bureau,
                    Grant. I had not expected to be in Vietnam longer than a week or two. And I was
                    lied to systematically.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of Mr. Gaud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Very understanding. And I was being transferred out. I had planned to go
                    elsewhere at that time, i.e. to one of the international agencies. It was a very
                    unhappy time of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a primary security issue that you concluded
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm not sure I know what you mean. Personal security never bothered me
                    particularly. While I had been in infantry war in 1944-45 and did not like it at
                    all, that was not a problem. Perhaps, we could have won the war, but that to me
                    was a secondary issue. The real issue was what we were doing to the United
                    States, and how we misunderstood what was going on in Vietnam.If one goes back
                    in history to Ho Chi Minh in France in 1919-1920, here is this image of a poor
                    struggling Vietnamese Indo-Chinese who presents himself at every political
                    gathering in the country trying to make the French understand that the
                    Indo-Chinese want their independence. The only political group in all of France
                    that gave ear to any of this were the communists. In 1920 in Tours at the annual
                    meeting of the communist party, here is Ho Chi Minh receiving support. The
                    relevance of Marxism to Indochina is totally zero, perhaps a negative quantity.
                    But politically, this is where he got his support and was led right down the
                    path. The United States could have supported the independence of Indochina
                    except for our need of the French in dealing with communism. To this, one might
                    add the view that our support of the South also would convince the Russians of
                    our steadfastness in opposing Communism. Our Vietnam involvement ultimately, in
                    my judgment, was part of the cost of the cold war if you will.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I had a lot of contact but certainly not with villagers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It was very difficult to talk to villagers.There were all sorts of policy
                    problems. One of the more curious was the position of the South Koreans on
                    Vietnam. They had been encouraged to support our position in Vietnam and one of
                    the devices for insuring this was in effect a broad assurance that we would do
                    everything we could to help ease the economic impact of their being there. This
                    included opening up the PX's to their people. Also, there was a South Korean
                    group that was interested in getting the scrap metal out of the actual war
                    zones. It was their view that they had a first priority on this and that they
                    should be assisted in getting it out no matter what the cost in terms of dealing
                    with the war conditions. It was almost impossible to deal with this; they were
                    so clamorous in reiterating their demands for access to scrap metal.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Effectively I was there about six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I was the senior economic advisor of the AID Mission, but it was a very
                    small mission doing a lot of training through participant programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the transition? What kind of transition are you
                        talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>JONNES: Actually, I'm speaking of two transitions. The more significant one was
                    that of the Indonesian transition from the Sukarno government that had been
                    overthrown in 1965. There had been, I'm not sure what term I would use, a large
                    coup d'etat by the military, and four years later the nation was still in the
                    process of adjusting to that. The smaller transition was in the AID Mission that
                    was changing virtually all of its senior personnel at once. There was no Mission
                    Director at the time of my arrival, and what the function of the Mission beyond
                    participant training was seemed unclear.Once again the focus of my operation was
                    on general economic policy, but because the AID mission had not been a major
                    player in economic policy matters since early on in the history of modern
                    Indonesia, our role was muted. There was, however, a Harvard Development
                    Advisory Service team working with the Indonesians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that financed by us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. It was financed, I believe, by the Ford Foundation that also had a
                    group there. Several of the economic policy makers of the new Indonesian
                    government had been trained in the United States, and they were very sympathetic
                    to American advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were their training under our program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Some of it may have been, but I'm not sure. My time was passed getting
                    the economic data in order. As in most less developed countries the economic
                    data base was less than optimal, and trying to pull together all the
                    information—e.g on rice production and rice consumption, in the case of
                    Indonesia a critical economic determiner—took time and energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this preparatory to some reorientation of the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, it was simply trying to establish a basis for rational decisions on
                    economic matterI also worked with the World Bank people on balance of payments
                    data. We did have what seemed to me a very effective population program, that is
                    to say, family planning program, run by an American public health doctor, a
                    program ultimately taken up by the Indonesian army. They decided that this was
                    something that had to be done and applied their energies to it long after I had
                    gone.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>JONNES: With the advent to large oil production, the need for American financial
                    aid was clearly going to be limited. It was also very clear that the oil
                    business was going to be a very serious oil business and that foreign exchange
                    shortages would not be a constraint on Indonesia/s future economic growth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 19 what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: This was in 1969 and early 1970. One of the main economic problems for
                    Indonesia was one that of what policies should guide their use of these new
                    resources, and I suspect that there was a great deal of tension between the
                    policies that the Pertamina, the national oil producing company of Indonesia,
                    would follow. and what policies the government felt it should follow. How this
                    was solved ultimately proved to be, as I understand it, one of the unhappy
                    incidents of the international development process in the last 30-40 years. The
                    national oil company was able to use a vast amount of these resources in some
                    very bad investments. But this is hearsay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I suspect that is correct. But this all happened long after my
                    departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Appointment as deputy in USAID's Bureau for Program and Policy Coordination (PPC)
                    - 1970-73</p>
                <p>JONNES: At the end of March, 1970 I came back to Washington to become the deputy
                    chief of USAID's Program Planning and Coordination (PPC), which was both the
                    budget and the planning body of the AID agency. The office was essentially part
                    of the office of the administrator, and was one of his principal devices in
                    following and effecting the agency's programs. At the time Dr. John Hannah,
                    former president of Michigan State University, was a year into his
                    administration, and the head of PPC, Ernie Stern, had been six months in his
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who became the administrator then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, John Hannah was the administrator until 1973 when Dan Parker
                    succeeded him.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Hannah was there all the time you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Until he left at the end of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the deputy in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I was the deputy in PPC from the spring of 1970 until the fall of 1973 at
                    which time I moved up and joined Dan Parker in the office of the administrator
                    as general assistant. There was no deputy administrator of AID at that time.Dan
                    Parker had come over from the White House all alone, and he needed help. We did
                    not get a deputy administrator for 6-7 months when John Murphy came in. During
                    that period I pinch-hit in many ways for Parker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of the acting deputy administrator
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES. That's just about it. Hannah had given me the formal title of Assistant
                    Deputy Administrator when Maury Williams was detailed to the Vietnam Peace
                    talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to PPC. What were the preoccupations at PPC
                        at that time in terms of development policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>JONNES: I think the principal preoccupation when I joined the office was to
                    insure that we understood what actually was going on in the agency. This, as you
                    know, was a very difficult period because of the new administration. Beyond
                    this, there is a natural tendency among managers to maximize operational
                    independence. In the case of AID, this meant essentially that the regional
                    bureaus wished to operate so far as possible on their own. The bureaus felt that
                    they alone knew what was happening in their part of the world and how they
                    should use their resources. What added complexity to the process was that of
                    course in some respects the bureaus were correct in their actions. But our
                    obligation was to try to sort out what was happening from what we as an
                    organization maintained was happening.The initial problem for any new
                    administration was to assure that its chief, as head of the agency, was informed
                    about and able to assume meaningful responsibility for the agency. The function
                    of PPC in my view was to help the administrator to inform himself on the entire
                    range of the Agency's business and then help him to direct the use of the
                    resources appropriated to us to achieve what we wanted to achieve. The central
                    office of program planning and coordination thus was a major link between the
                    administrator and the regional entities, but as you well know, we were not the
                    sole source of information for the administrator.We at the same time had the
                    problem of almost non-stop appearances before the Congress to explain what we
                    wanted to do, what we needed by way of resources to do that, and what we had
                    thought we had done with the resources of the past. The day to day operation of
                    the offices, of our office, often overwhelmed the more general efforts we had in
                    hand. This mix of planning, budgeting, and coordinating was one of the major
                    elements of our work.The budget functions which were critical in various senses
                    took up a major amount of time; i.e., we were usually operating in three
                    different time sequences: 1. the current budget year, 2. the planned budget
                    year, 3. the budget year two years previously which always required
                    reconciliation and always had implications both for the current fiscal year and
                    the next fiscal year. Funds that had not been committed and/or expended in the
                    past might or might not be available now or in the near term future or further
                    on down the way. I found myself increasingly involved in budget operations,
                    something I had not previously been exposed to, that is to say, budget
                    operations in the technical sense of the U.S. budget.A note here on quite a
                    different theme. In the late 1960's the American Economic Association under the
                    urging of Andrew Brimmer had become increasingly concerned at the lack of black
                    economists in the country. He, Brimmer, suggested that we, the US, and the
                    association should look more carefully at the problem. We the economists at AID
                    took him up and devised a program in the early 1970's for interns who would
                    spend half their time working in AID— anywhere in the organization concerned
                    with economic problems— and half their time in degree programs at any one of
                    eight local universities looking toward ultimate Ph. D. economists. PPC with the
                    bureaus worked up a small program. We had maybe a dozen people under this
                    program which as I saw it over the next three years seemed to be working
                    reasonably well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know anybody that had come out of that
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>JONNES: No, not now, but I know that some did come out, and they went elsewhere
                    in the US government in economic positions. Another program which PPC undertook
                    was to work more closely with the predominately black colleges and universities
                    in the country to assure that they, if they were interested, could draw upon us
                    for information, course material, help in arranging seminars, etc. To this end
                    we sponsored a series of conferences primarily in southern states in
                    predominately black institutions. We would take a group of 5, 6, or 7 of us from
                    AID and run a series of seminars for a couple of days. We would do this in
                    various spots and bring in perhaps 15-20 institutional groups.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a particular development philosophy then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm tempted to say that the particular development philosophy at this
                    time was essentially that implicit in the Ranis-Fei model of the relationship of
                    agricultural development to industrial development, that a necessary condition
                    of modernizing the economies of primitive societies was an increase in the
                    efficiency of the agricultural sector from which the policy-makers of the
                    country in question must then seek the resources to finance the investments in
                    infrastructure and industrial development. But the extraordinary range of
                    differences among the nations receiving our aid made it virtually impossible to
                    generalize theories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the PPC at that time you and Ernie Stern were
                        pushing agricultural development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Pushing is a strong word. Certainly, there was a recognition of the
                    importance of the agricultural sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about central planning and the work in the course of
                        the previous year had been very strong, lots of central planning units and
                        offices like the Pakistan-India experience and so on. What was the view at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think we were a great deal more relaxed about central planning. In
                    nations that do not have functioning financial markets, it is obviously
                    difficult to rely upon interest rates to guide investment. In such situations
                    one needs some criteria that perhaps only the government can supply. Even in our
                    world, in this country we do need criteria on public investment beyond the test
                    of market interest rates. This was the problem that Turkey encountered. For a
                    long time the Turkish state economic enterprises had no criteria whatsoever
                    beyond politics and inertia to allocate new investments. As a consequence they
                    had a shambles. But on the other hand one does not want the model of our Russian
                    friends, the detailed planning for and compulsory implementation at the micro
                    level. Even at today's level of computer competence, I would suggest that is
                    obviously impossible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there particular concerns about infrastructure, you
                        talked about agriculture. Where would you think the emphasis for research
                        goes apart from going to agriculture programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: This varied so from country to country. I think one tended to look away
                    from overall criteria other than that of efficiency. What is good for country
                    “A” need not be good for country “B”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was very much a bottom up country programming
                        process you say? It was a fairly open criterion. You weren't pushing any
                        particular emphasis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It was for the aid-receiving nation itself to decide what its priorities
                    were. Then one takes a look; then the discussion can begin. I think if anything
                    we needed the talks to have more humility than we had. If only because there
                    were so many nations.</p>
                <p>Another venture that we in PPC launched was really an extension of the work that
                    we had started with the predominately black universities. This was an expansion
                    of our information program, i.e., an effort to talk with groups around the
                    country as to what the AID programs were about. In 1973-74 we made a remarkable
                    number of visits around the United States using a wide range of media. We did a
                    lot of TV work. We did a lot of radio work. We met with editors and editorial
                    writers. I often felt that one of the real weaknesses of our programs was that
                    there was almost no understanding of our programs. We really had a serious go. I
                    had no idea what influence, if any, our efforts had, but my Lord, we talked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the period when the foreign assistance program

                <p>JONNES: That's right!</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>JONNES: It is very difficult to link the individual effort to the larger sum of
                    public opinion. Who knows? I basically was surprised at the warm reception we
                    got. I was all over the country at one time or another. How effectively we
                    spoke; how effectively we persuaded? I was not so much concerned with persuasion
                    as simply to explain. Here is what aid is about. Here is what we are trying to
                    do. Here is why we, the president, the Congress, believe that this is a venture
                    that the US government should be involved in. In the long run it is in our best
                    interest if we succeed in doing that which we are setting out to do. This was
                    the major thrust of the operation. Heaven knows there is enough
                    misunderstanding, willful or otherwise of what we were up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with the State Department? After all,
                        this was about foreign policy. And the Treasury Department, what were they
                        trying to get us to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: At the State Department we had at the central level, very close
                    cooperation with the planning staff of the department. The number two man,
                    Arthur Hartman, who was subsequently our ambassador in France and the Soviet
                    Union, had worked with the Marshall PlaHe had a great deal of understanding and
                    sympathy for the AID program. On the economic side we had a variety of people
                    with whom we were as one who had worked either with or at AID. Sid Weintraub,
                    for example, had been mission director in Chile. At the time I was there he was
                    deputy assistant secretary for economic affairs and he was responsible for
                    working with us. You had really a very close friendly operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had supporting assistance at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I forget the timing of the change in management of supporting assistance.
                    I'm trying to remember when the supporting assistance was set up as a separate
                    unit in the State Department. It must have been in '71 or '72, at which time
                    they in essence went their own way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, some. Nigeria may have received some funding from supporting
                    assistance in fiscal years 1971 and 1972, despite the misgivings that we in PPC
                    had. I had visited Nigeria in the fall of 1970 with a group to examine that
                    country's need for assistance.</p>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>JONNES: The civil war was over and one question in Washington was whether Nigeria
                    needed help to get over yet another transition. Our conclusion was that they
                    certainly would need technical assistance in large quantities, but they did not,
                    repeat not, need capital assistance at that time because they had oil. You know
                    oil production and oil revenues came back very rapidly and so far as foreign
                    exchange revenues were concerned, Nigeria had no problem. Of course a year later
                    in '73 with the extraordinary increase in the price of oil Nigeria was doing
                    very well indeed. We did not foresee that mind you. We did see that the oil was
                    going to change the nature of their economy, but we still gave them some
                    supporting assistance.</p>

                <p>JONNES: Oh my heavens! I worked very closely with the Vietnam bureau. I was a
                    link between the central staff and the bureau simply because Bob Nooter and I
                    were able to get along together very well. But my recollection of any issues
                    with them is nil.</p>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>JONNES: My inclination would be to let him speak to the question. Another issue
                    was that of the relationship of multilateral aid operations to bilateral aid. I
                    think all of us in the US aid business would have agreed to two general
                    propositions on this subject that bespoke use of international, multilateral aid
                    operations. First, the problem of burden-sharing, i. e. of encouraging others to
                    carry part of the financing costs of these programs, could be more easily
                    resolved in the context of negotiations for the funding of international
                    agencies than on a random basis. And second, it would be easier in a political
                    sense for the United States to have international bodies negotiate difficult
                    agreements with aid recipients than to have these nations unhappy with the US
                    for seeking difficult policy changes on a bilateral basis. I would say that we
                    were hopeful that the increasing use of the multilateral lending agencies—the
                    World Bank, the regional development lending banks, Asian development bank,
                    African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank—would lead to a
                    much more effective development effort.On the other hand it quickly became clear
                    to me that if the Congress had strong antipathies to AID, their hostility to US
                    support for multilateral agencies was at least one order of magnitude greater.
                    This latter reflected their feelings that if they make contributions to
                    international agencies their control over those funds would be substantially
                    lower than similar appropriations to AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you testify before Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Occasionally, but usually I appeared on the Hill as a supporting
                    witness.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of that experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: A painful process, because we had such marvelous Congressional performers
                    as Otto Passman, Clarence Long, Wayne Hayes, Fulbright. I found myself now and
                    again with one or another Secretary of State explaining arcane budget matters
                    that a Secretary of State should never have been called upon to speak to. For
                    example, Lawton Childs was then in the Senate and was responsible for the Senate
                    appropriations committee dealing with the AID program. I found myself explaining
                    all sorts of issues that I never would have dreamed of explaining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Congress was mostly concerned with

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It varied sharply. The reason I would be called upon would be to explain
                    details. I don't recall that I was ever a lead witness.</p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm trying to recall at one point which must have been in late '72 the
                    then deputy administrator, Maury Williams went to Paris with Secretary of State
                    Kissinger. Dr. Hannah had me move up to the front office and appointed me
                    assistant deputy administrator, but I think that appointment lasted maybe 2
                    months. It was simply an administrative convenience for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything in particular you were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I just continued doing my regular work, but I moved my office so that
                    I could receive foreign visitors and that sort of thing which took some of the
                    burden off of Dr. Hannah.. In late 1973 the news came that Dr. Hannah was
                    leaving. The new administrator was to be Dan Parker. I don't even remember how
                    it was that I ended up moving upstairs with him nor even what my title might
                    have been. In any event, clearly he was going to have problems because he had no
                    help from outside and had had no experience with AID. In any event I had been
                    named mission director to Morocco and had even stopped in Rabat to talk with our
                    ambassador. We sent our car on, but at the last minute Parker asked me if I
                    would not reconsider. I said, “Sure.” I did in fact reconsider and we brought
                    our car back and I moved up at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do with Mr. Parker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I was trying to make his arrival in the agency as painless as possible
                    for him and in turn for the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: He needed somebody who knew the agency reasonably well and who could
                    point out to him where he was at any given time, who everybody was, and what
                    particular interests were at play in individual decisions. I would also try to
                    inform him of consequences of actions and pitfalls. Any new chief in the agency
                    requires some kind of support, for his arrival is a serious occasion for all
                    concerned.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>JONNES: Dan Parker was deeply interested in management techniques which is not
                    surprising given his backgrounds as the son of an entrepreneur and the head of a
                    major manufacturing company. What were the sources of information available to
                    him both about the agency operations and the aid recipients. He was interested
                    in the channels through which the information flowed. He was very much
                    interested in, not surprisingly, what the agency could do to encourage private
                    investment in the less developed world. He was deeply concerned with his
                    relations with the Congress and how these should be conducted and who should
                    conduct them. He was almost in every sense of the word a new boy on the street
                    in that he had little or no exposure to the principal problems that he was being
                    asked to deal with, i.e., to administer foreign aid, to allocate foreign
                    assistance, to recommend to the President and the OMB what way we should go. I
                    was with him for almost a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular view you were trying to get him
                        to understand or line to follow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would say not beyond trying to have him appreciate the extraordinary
                    range of problems that by definition we in the foreign assistance business were
                    trying to deal with, the emergence of a whole new political and economic world
                    in much of the world. It is enough to inspire a great deal of humility, but that
                    is not really an American characteristic. He was very concerned understandably
                    with the question of his relations with the Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger.
                    They operated at very different levels. We spent a remarkable amount of time
                    getting Dr. Kissinger ready to testify on the foreign aid business which
                    included the preparation of Kissinger's statements. At that time Kissinger was
                    really the international star because he was in the process of resolving the
                    Israeli-Egyptian, Israeli-Arab problems for the short run. We had to take
                    Kissinger up to the Hill four times once to each of the appropriations
                    committees and each of the authorization committees on the foreign assistance
                    bill. Each time required lengthy statements from him and we worked very closely
                    with Kissinger. Subsequently we worked very closely with him in preparation for
                    the World Food Congress in the fall of 1974. All of this necessitated an
                    extraordinary amount of drafting and redrafting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the meetings with Kissinger? What
                        were your impressions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I had met Kissinger at Harvard glancingly as he was one of the professors
                    working with the Center for International Affairs. There's no need to belabor
                    the obvious, that he is a brilliant man. He had conducted perhaps three seminars
                    with the Fellows of the Center.As he appeared before the Congressional
                    committees on behalf of foreign aid, he would actually deliver our speeches as
                    to what foreign aid was up to and what we wanted to do, but would of course use
                    the subsequent discussions for his own purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he interested in foreign aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>JONNES: Not particularly. He regarded it as one of the numerous instruments at
                    his disposal for the conduct of foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular ways he was trying to direct the
                        flow of aid funds or use them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Sure. He wanted to make sure he had sufficient aid money for Israel and
                    Egypt in that particular year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other countries or other situations? Did he have any other
                        views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: He had views on virtually everything, a very lively intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there wasn't any involvement or perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: He spoke the words, Haven, but his interest in economic development and
                    his belief in the possibility for significant change as a consequence of
                    economic development probably were quite limited. Three or four times that I was
                    talking to him quite apart from the normal conduct of business I had the
                    impression that he was not particularly optimistic about what we were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other matters that you were working with Parker
                        on, e.g., the organization or structure of AID or was he concerned with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not really. At the end of this year or so of work with Parker, I retired
                    for the first time and then came back twice as a consultant with Parker. Once
                    simply because he needed more help. The second time, to work with him on the
                    preparations for a possible transition after the election of 1976. That would
                    have been in the summer of 1976 that Sid Weintraub and I were working with
                    Parker to prepare him for the transition that would follow from the
                    election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We were just seeking to insure that AID did not get lost in the shuffle
                    of administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular lines you were promoting at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>JONNES: No, there were no lines beyond the need for a reasonable transition in
                    the administration of foreign aid. One of my most difficult periods with Parker
                    was when he used me as a liaison with Otto Passman, the chairman of the
                    subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that dealt with our
                    appropriation. We were having a great deal of pressure put on us by Passman to
                    stay out of the rice market, i.e., not to buy rice at that time. Why he was
                    doing that was a matter of some speculation. It led to an indictment in federal
                    courts subsequently, but he was found not guilty on the charge in a subsequent
                    trial (for which there had been a change of venue to Monroe, Louisiana, his
                    hometown). This would have been in the summer of 1974 that we needed to buy rice
                    for emergency stocks in Cambodia and we were going to go into the market no
                    matter what the price was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not PL 480?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It is my recollection that this was not under PL 480. Passman was adamant
                    that we not do this, and I had to go over there every morning for a couple of
                    weeks. At 8:30 in the morning I would present myself at his office and talk to
                    him for perhaps an hour about why we needed to buy rice to establish and
                    maintain stocks of rice in Phnom Penh against God knows what emergency. Of
                    course we were right in the long run. We bought the rice but Passman was very,
                    very, very unhappy with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You bought the rice on the US market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that from Louisiana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I do not know. There was a hypothesis that he was working on behalf of
                    some company that had a contract to supply Indonesia, and they had to go into
                    the market. They wanted the price to be as low as possible. They wanted no one
                    else going in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you left AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I left AID, yes, but Mr. Passman was not a factor in this. I had a
                    retirement of 2 � years, but then I was recalled and assigned to Paris as the US
                    representative on the Development Assistance Committee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you retired from AID what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A brief retirement and help with transition in administrations - 1975-76</p>
                <p>JONNES: I immediately went back to school to study Greek and Latin. I had in mind
                    taking up a second career, as it were, in classical archeology—as in fact I have
                    done—and enrolled in Georgetown in both Greek and Latin. I then moved over to
                    The Catholic University of America in northeast Washington to study much more
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did that interest come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In some part from the assignment to Turkey. As you know Turkey was in
                    antiquity one of the centers of Greek and Roman culture. Beginning about 1000
                    B.C. the Greeks began moving into the littoral areas of western Anatolia,
                    western Asia Minor, and then the Romans moved in at the very beginning of the
                    second century B.C. In 190 BC they defeated one of the successors of Alexander,
                    a descendant of one of the successors of Alexander, Antiochus. Over the next 200
                    years they subdued most of Asia Minor, and the area became a constituent part of
                    their empire. In 50 BC. for example, Cicero, as pro-consul of Cilicia, was
                    riding a circuit court in central Asia Minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do some archeological work while you were in
                        Turkey on assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I was working overtime on a regular basis that precluded that
                    possibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you spent 2 years in school then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I enrolled in the summer of 1975 at Catholic University. I had already
                    started the language studies at Georgetown. Also I was doing some consulting for
                    AID, as I mentioned above, the work with Weintraub to examine transitions after
                    the elections. Sidney and I spent about 3 months working for the AID
                    Administrator, Parker, beginning his preparations for the consequences of the
                    election..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>JONNES: What were we thinking about? We were thinking about where the emphases of
                    foreign assistance should be, where we might better concentrate the agency's,
                    the American effort. We were thinking about how one sorts out how the US
                    government, as opposed to AID, sorts out the questions of responsibility on the
                    part of regional lending organizations or the World Bank or the United Nations
                    Technical Assistance Administration, these sorts of questions. Who should do
                    what. Basically what we were doing was doing a road-map of who bore
                    responsibilities for what to guide the people coming in, together with a few
                    suggestions, as I recall, about where comparative advantage might lie in the
                    administration of aid funds. It was primarily a basic paper for anybody who was
                    concerned with the role of the United States in the international arena of
                    development. I guess it was just about 2 years I was in school, you're right,
                    but a couple of semesters were divided between consulting work here and studies
                    at Catholic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any significant consulting work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, it was helping Dan Parker. Many months after the elections, i.e., in
                    mid-1977, Ted Van Dyke called me to ask if I would like to take the job of US
                    representative to the Development Assistance Committee in Paris.</p>
                <p>Return to the Development Assistance Committee (OECD)as U.S. Representative -
                    1977</p>
                <p>JONNES: I was intrigued with the offer largely because with the arrival of the
                    new administration, I had the strong impression that there was a tremendous
                    burst of interest in what the United States might be able to do to assist more
                    effectively in the development of the third world. This transcended AID's brief
                    of course as it would involve changes in trade policy, and most important a new
                    concern with the problems of poverty.</p>
                <p>In June and July of 1977 there was a series of meetings in Paris, basically at
                    the urging of the French but with most of the western nations, to consider the
                    establishment of a new body to reconsider many of the problems of the developing
                    world and possible new policies that would help the poorer world in dealing with
                    these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was John Gilligan the administrator at that time under the
                        Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: John Gilligan came in, that's right. But it was Cyrus Vance, the
                    Secretary of State, who appeared to be very interested in moving American policy
                    towards a far more forthcoming posture in terms of our support for the
                    developing world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering where the initiative came from.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>JONNES: Basically from the French. In any event I thought that by accepting the
                    appointment, I would go as representative to DAC but would also be involved in
                    the work on a new system for talking with the less developed world and bringing
                    them in to the ongoing discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Chairman of DAC then? Maury Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, Maury Williams was. Some 10-12 months later, John Lewis succeeded
                    him. John had been with AID as Mission Director in India back in the mid-1960's
                    and before that he had been a member of the Council of Economic Advisors.</p>
                <p>What happened in the summer of 1977 other than that I was in the process of
                    accepting this appointment was that the United States after further thought
                    decided that the proposals on the table of the Conference on economic
                    cooperation with the third world weren't really what we had in mind. I never
                    really understood what happened to Mr. Vance's interest, but it seemed to wane,
                    and the ongoing conference in Paris proved to be no longer ongoing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There had been a conference in the late spring of '77 of western nations.
                    I think it was basically the western nations: ourselves, western Europe,
                    Japanese, Australians, Canadians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was separate from the DAC group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Oh yes. Having nothing whatsoever to do with the OECD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have a name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Something close to the Conference on Economic Cooperation with the
                    third-world.So I arrived in Paris and found myself with no portfolio beyond my
                    responsibilities for the DAC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into that did the conference meet at all
                        ?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>JONNES: It did meet regularly but not after mid 1977. The original thought I
                    believe had been that it would be an ongoing conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do? What was accomplished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Little. It simply vanished from the scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it trying to promote something or was it just a
                        dialogue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think it turned out to be only a dialogue. What they had had in mind
                    originally was the transforming of the dialogue into various national
                    policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern with the DAC business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not beyond the substance, but there was no organic link. I was only
                    concerned with the DAC business. But it seemed to me that the real questions of
                    development were no longer that which had prompted our original interest in and
                    support for the DAC. Most other members of the DAC were doing better in terms of
                    their assistance, providing in relative terms more resources for the
                    underdeveloped world than the United States was. As a major element of our
                    original interest had been to encourage other members of the industrialized
                    world to increase their aid programs, we had achieved our objective and what do
                    you do then? From my point of view and I think from that of AID generally, the
                    question was how do we work more effectively with all other aid donors? Part of
                    the answer to that had already been supplied through the system of consortia or
                    regional aid groups that had emerged either under the aegis of the World Bank or
                    the OECD or informal operating arrangements based in the country that was
                    actually receiving aid. At this time also the AID agency was changing its views
                    toward development; a new theme had emerged that human needs should be met
                    contemporaneously with the development process. In the US view as these nations
                    developed they should make every effort to improve the basic health of their
                    citizens, the basic education available to their citizens, and the basic needs
                    such as shelter. To which one could not take exception, but in practice this is
                    very difficult because it represents some competition for resources at the
                    margin. As a nation develops, the climate for new investment is almost
                    insatiable, without limit. If you throw into that also the additional
                    consumption requirements to meet the needs of further education or further
                    health, it represents a terrible competition for always scarce resources, be
                    they foreign exchange resources or the nation's own savings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view about what was called “New Directions”
                        at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>JONNES: My view was that I was representing our official policy, that this was a
                    US policy that should be followed generally by all of us in the western world.
                    We had virtually non-stop conversations at various levels among the aid donors,
                    meetings of the heads of aid agencies meetings of the people responsible for
                    particular regions for particular countries. We had meetings to discuss, for
                    example, the role of women in development. We had a very active period. I would
                    only add that I had a considerable degree of scepticism about the new directions
                    if only because of the origins of the doctrine, that they had been proposed
                    originally as a means of obtaining additional Congressional support for aid
                    without any reference to the effectiveness of the policy in development
                    terms.One other aspect of our operations in Paris was we worked toward getting
                    the Arab aid agencies into the aid-giving business. We did this initially by
                    proposing that we have a DAC meeting with the Arab aid agencies. I forget
                    whether Joe Wheeler was the deputy administrator at the time. In any event he
                    and I went down to Saudi Arabia and into the Gulf Emirates, talked to all of
                    their aid people, and found that they were very interested indeed in cooperation
                    with DAC members. This led to a series of meetings in Paris with all of the
                    Arabs that were concerned with providing resources to the less developed
                    nations. This was a new element in the DAC agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when the Arab countries had an increase in
                        resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: To say the least. But the other side of the increase in their resources
                    was that some of less-developed nations were hard hit by the increase in their
                    fuel bills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular issue you had to address with
                        them at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, that of their resource flows. In the first instance we had to learn
                    what they were charged with doing, who they were, where they were operating, in
                    what aspects of development work they would be interested , and then one could
                    talk to them either on a general basis or a country basis or project basis. In
                    the first year of my assignment to the DAC, I began to think that since we in
                    point of fact had already achieved our primary objective through the DAC,
                    perhaps the time had come to close down the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that would turn back on us then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>JONNES: I don't understand what you mean. But my thought was why don't we work
                    very seriously at the DAC and see whether we should just not do away with it and
                    find simpler, more direct devices for doing the same thing as we were doing
                    there. Looking at the various components of the work, first, there was the
                    collection of statistics on aid giving, certainly to be continued. A base had
                    been established; the DAC Secretariat did this job very well. They did not need
                    lengthy discussions. Any problems with the statistics could be resolved by the
                    Secretariat. Then, did we need the annual aid review as a device to stimulate
                    more aid giving? I always felt that simply by meeting with the principals of the
                    chief aid agencies one could achieve very much the same thing. We knew what we
                    were doing. There were certain inherent tensions in the DAC operations in my
                    judgment because of some mild bias on the part of the Europeans against the OECD
                    ( and therefore the DAC) simply because the United States had been the
                    instigator of the OECD originally to establish an institution for handling all
                    of the operating problems of the Marshall plan. In their eyes our influence was
                    disproportionate to what it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were still a contributor to the OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Oh yes, certainly. We were a dues-paying member of the OECD whereas
                    technically we had not been a member of the OECD, and our presence to some
                    Europeans represented a contamination of their “privileged” discussions, and
                    their preference — which I'm sure you have seen in various situations — their
                    preference was to use the European community organization as the main
                    operational fulcrum for discussions with the United States rather than coming in
                    to the OECD. Whenever there was any serious policy discussion the European
                    interest was in having the discussions in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were internal community interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Exactly. But if we had some sort of serious problem—for example when the
                    Soviet Union began to dissolve, a myriad questions came forward concerning the
                    economic consequences and how we of the west should deal with them and where we
                    might establish a center to work with the Russians on these. I had thought that
                    the one eminently logical place to consider these was in the OECD. But without
                    knowing the facts, I am sure that the Community would never have agreed to so
                    doing. The ECC would not have it that way at all..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of a keep the US in the background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES. Not so much that as that by operating as the Community, their negotiating
                    strength was greater, I should think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were contributing what to the OECD, 25 percent ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the DAC discussions then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: How would I differentiate this? As long as we were talking about
                    generalities be they in terms of policy, be they in terms of aid allocations, as
                    long as one was discussing the generalities, fine, the DAC could deal with this
                    as far as the Europeans were concerned. But the moment you might turn to formal
                    commitments or serious changes in policies of members, the Europeans would push
                    to move the discussions/negotiations over to the Community, i.e., to Brussels.
                    They as a community would make up their mind, and then they could take us on.I
                    had always in my younger years considered the OECD- OECD a fine device for
                    serious discussions and negotiations. Here there is a paradox because on the one
                    hand, the US had strongly favored Europe's unification, but here I am bespeaking
                    an approach to negotiation-deliberation with the Europeans in a context of their
                    existence as nations, not as part of the Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else you were trying to bring about
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: You mean apart from the end of the DAC? Well, my efforts proved to be in
                    vain. We would talk about what the DAC was doing and the utility thereof, but
                    the consensus turned out to be that the DAC should continue. It was very clear
                    there was no great drive to change the nature of the DAC, and the power of
                    inertia once again prevailed. What I tried to do very informally was that
                    whenever senior American officials were in Paris, I would take them off to one
                    or another of the major aid donors just to talk through the range of our
                    particular problems. On one occasion the deputy administrator, Bob Nooter, and I
                    went up to Copenhagen after one of his visits to Paris, and we met there with
                    the Danish, Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian aid administrators. We were there
                    for 2 days, and I thought it was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We talked about what we were doing in specific countries, talked about
                    problems of aid in particular countries and how we were coping, talked about
                    what seemed to be working in a couple of African countries. Talked about
                    anything they wanted to talk about and we wanted to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no particular issue or program you were trying
                        to advance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>JONNES: No particular issue, just did they have problems. How did they deal with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we try to influence the other donors on policies on
                        certain subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: We were talking about how we were struggling with implementation of our
                    policy of meeting basic human needs, because the agency at that time was trying
                    to work through all of the implications of this new policy. We were trying to
                    get them to follow more or less the same general line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that they were responsive to our ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: The Scandinavians would say that they had been doing that from time
                    immemorial. They had been worried about social policy from the very beginning in
                    their development aid processes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the dialogues with the major donors: the
                        British, the French, the Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think the Germans were very skeptical, the French weren't very
                    interested, the Brits were interested but were not clear on how we saw this
                    working itself into the aid process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they supported continuing the DAC I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, everybody supported continuing the DAC except myself. I felt a
                    powerful case had been made by one of my predecessors, Stuart Van Dyke, who had
                    taken a long look at the question and came to about the same conclusions as
                    I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think the others felt it should be
                        continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Inertia. Jobs, to be blunt about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had a sense that some of those major donors are not
                        that interested in coordination which is what the DAC is about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>JONNES: That's right. That's part of it, but coordination takes place at all
                    sorts of levels. For example in Turkey we had a very small group of European
                    countries that was active. It was interesting particularly in the sense that the
                    Europeans were able on occasion to get messages back to the necessary home
                    office through which action could be expedited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find those areas where people were willing to
                        work together or cooperate on something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, on large investment projects for example, there was a considerable
                    commercial interest. For the Keban dam project we had in effect a sub-working
                    group and with the European Investment Bank that was putting in money for the
                    Community and then we had the Germans and I think the French and the Italians,
                    it was a very effective group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the DAC were there specific things that caught
                        their interest where they were willing to join together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not in this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Club du Sahel was formed before you got there. What
                        was the attitude toward that because it was born out of the DAC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would say it was regarded as an operational activity under French and
                    US auspices and that as such, it was simply another type of aid coordinating
                    group. I believe that at one point the DAC Chairman, Maury Williams, also headed
                    the Sahel group, and he was doing a very good job. But this again had nothing to
                    do with the DAC as such. So the relationships between the DAC and the Sahel were
                    in a sense a random phenomenon in my judgment, that the people concerned with it
                    happened to have responsibilities on both sides. Of course the Sahel got a great
                    deal of attention at the time. The OECD had one big session of the Club, that
                    the President's mother, Mrs. Carter, attended. There may have been
                    joint—sponsorship OECD-Club du Sahel because the Secretary General of the OECD,
                    Emile van Lennep, was delighted to play a part in all of this. He was not
                    prepared to play many roles vis a vis the DAC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't very interested in the DAC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. He was, quite rightly concerned primarily with the economic growth of
                    members and the dynamics thereof. Aid matters were a sideshow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the DAC have any dialogues with the developing
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: As I mentioned in my earlier discussion of my first assignment to Paris,
                    the DAC did have a variety of meetings with representatives of developing
                    countries. This is a complex question, but I suspect the Europeans shied away
                    from such practices, because these were part of the real world, and if there
                    were true operating decisions to be made say on aid, they didn't want to have
                    them made in the DAC. They were perfectly willing to discuss generalities, and
                    occasionally we did have meeting of the DAC at which individuals from the
                    less-developed world were present, but the discussions were in generalities, say
                    on basic human needs and links thereof to aid, women in development, but there
                    were no meetings with governments of the less developed world to talk about aid
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Members wanted to preserve their bilateral
                        communications.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I think it was the Community relationship. What I'm saying is that in the
                    beginning in the DAC, this is to say in 1962-64 we as the Committee did meet
                    several times with representatives of African and Asian countries. But as the
                    world system of aid coordination evolved, the consortia and consultative groups
                    became really the principal technique for dealing with the aid needs of
                    individual countries, their specific development problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consultant groups and the like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Consultative groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your second period, do you recall any formal movement
                        toward dialogues with developing countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: As I said, we did have representatives present at general discussions.
                    For example, at our first large discussion of basic human needs we had a range
                    of third country nationals present. They were certainly not there as
                    representatives of their governments; they were there in the context of being
                    experts on development. These meetings were not always very felicitous, because
                    it is one thing for someone to talk as an individual and another thing for them
                    to talk for their government as a representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the DAC in its own discussions tended to
                        be isolated from the real world? That it was talking to itself rather than
                        talking...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>JONNES: I think that was almost inevitable. That's what it was about originally
                    in one sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there subgroups formed at that time on particular
                        topics that you were engaged in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There was one group on aid requirements taking a look at the needs for
                    aid generally so far as this was possible. We had the whole subsection dealing
                    with the aid review i.e., individual country members' aid programs, examination
                    of these and the representatives of each would come to discuss and be queried on
                    what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But any of the basic human needs subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No. It had a statistics working group because all the others had
                    questions of statistics, questions of principle. How do we treat the flow of
                    private investment to the third world? Surely this has some element of aid or
                    does it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather the DAC came to some conclusions at the
                        representative level and then these went to a higher level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Once a year there was a high level meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of those high level
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I thought it was a very good thing to have the heads of aid agencies
                    talking with one another about the particular problems. It provided a basis for
                    personal contact, i. e., now and again , one could pick up the phone, call a
                    colleague, and say “What about this?” I didn't like the notion of an old boys
                    network, but it is helpful to be able to talk with people directly with whom you
                    are having difficulties or with whom you want to do business. In this sense I've
                    always thought we were a community, we in the aid business. I got to know the
                    aid agencies, people in the aid agencies in all the European countries. This
                    wasn't always as helpful as I thought it might be. For example, on one occasion
                    I was trying to find financial support among the Europeans for the fertilizer
                    institute of the TVA which had become part of the worldwide agricultural
                    research community. My passing of the begging bowl produced nothing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CRIAR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>JONNES: Right, I just thought this was an ideal opportunity for the Europeans to
                    help us, but they couldn't find any means for support which reflected, I guess,
                    a lack of interest. anywhere to put in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no support for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Support in principle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in that period vis a vis the flows of
                        aid and the structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There was the opportunity to expand somewhat but the American relative
                    performance sank steadily. One always had the problem of the definition of aid.
                    To what extent could one take credit for financial assistance going into Vietnam
                    or Israel, the problem I mentioned previously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of the colleagues that attended the
                        many meetings of the DAC group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There were very few aid people from the other governments. If you had
                    meetings that appeared to be of interest at home, they would send their aid
                    people, but otherwise you were dealing primarily with foreign office
                    representatives who might or might not be knowledgeable on the subject at
                    hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the meetings sort of sterile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: More sterile than they should have been. Both Maurice Williams and John
                    Lewis, both having been aid operational types, were very good. I think their
                    being there, as officers who had been responsible for aid operations and knowing
                    the aid business, may have encouraged people from capitals to come to the DAC,
                    but this was a continuing problem who is going to represent the governments on
                    these particular issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your view now about the DAC?</hi>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>JONNES: It was a very useful device initially to inform and instruct as part of
                    the process of dealing with the problem of sharing the burden of aid to the
                    third world. Politically, we in the United States, if we were going to be in the
                    aid business had to demonstrate that others shared our view. It would have been
                    almost impossible for us to have continued our aid programs at the level we had
                    reached in the '60s absent some concrete demonstration that the Europeans, the
                    Canadians, the Australians, the Japanese were also in the aid business and
                    considered it very important that the development of the poor nations, as far as
                    we could effect it, was continuing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the learning process? Was there any mutual
                        learning about how to go about any particular development topic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I hesitate to speak to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the IBRD part of the DAC group when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, from the beginning. They were represented through their
                    representative in Paris who usually was an operational type. Yes they were with
                    us all the way through. They were with us at the high level meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it customary for other donors or aid groups to join?
                        The UN and other banks and development institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Back in my first go around with the DAC we would have conversations as to
                    what our positions on particular banks should be. At the time the African
                    Development Bank proposal was made, we talked this through. Not deciding who
                    would do this , but just talking about how we looked at it. I don't recall any
                    conversations. We certainly had Latin American meetings in the early 60's in
                    which the Inter American Development Bank was represented. I guess in my second
                    go around I recall an occasion when the Inter American Development Bank was
                    there with a large group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they weren't there as formal observers during your

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No.</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>JONNES: Well, Africa because of the European colonial history there and because
                    the problems were so overwhelming. Of course, the Sahel droughts just
                    exacerbated the situation there to a point beyond tragedy. The big development
                    problems certainly in everyone's eyes were India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the
                    subcontinent. By the political constellation of the time, China was not on our
                    agenda. Very much less interest in Latin America, again for obvious reasons. The
                    Europeans tended to regard this as an American province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any specific country discussions with the

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: There were in the 60's as we've discussed, but not in the 70's and
                    thereafter.. I don't remember any at all in the later period. We had gone beyond
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should the DAC continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: No, I would not have it continue. One could effect small savings for the
                    OECD and for the donors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Whoever is running AID, if indeed we have an AID program hereafter,
                    should make a point of having his principal lieutenants active in visiting their
                    counterparts. They should visit Europe once or twice a year to meet with our
                    colleagues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes. I mean there is no point in informational lectures on how we are set
                    up and how we operate. But as I said earlier there is a great deal to be gained
                    by knowing who is responsible for working with you in these places. How are you
                    going to deal with the problem of the conditions for aid? If indeed you are
                    making substantial loans for economic support, what do you seek as policy
                    changes by the recipient that will conduce to whatever end the recipient and you
                    are seeking? These are tough questions, and they vary sharply from country to
                    country.</p>
                <p>Observations on foreign assistance and international development</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's move on from there and talk more generally
                        about your views about development and the effectiveness of foreign
                        assistance. First, let's talk about AID in terms of its role as a foreign
                        policy instrument. How do you see the foreign assistance program being
                        effective in furthering U.S. foreign policy interests? Is it effective? Does
                        it serve that interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I have grave doubts that it is as effective as our friends in the State
                    Department like to think it is. I think that if one is talking about de facto
                    bribes, AID is just a most awkward agency to extend these... In my judgment
                    foreign assistance is important because of the generations to come. I think that
                    what happens out there in the rest of the world is going to affect us one way or
                    another in the longer run as it in the past has affected us. Affected us deeply.
                    I would like to think that the process of economic improvement, the process of
                    improving living standards reflects itself in a greater degree of peace and
                    stability.I'm not sure this is the case because as you know there are various
                    irrational factors at work in the world, irrational factors associated with
                    differences in religion, in cultures, in political creeds. One doesn't like to
                    think that if one is helping with economic development, that improved economy
                    will come to haunt one one day, making a more powerful enemy for you to deal
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the foreign policy point. During the
                        years which you were involved and in some of the countries, the Communist
                        threat was an important motivation for US response to countries in providing
                        foreign assistance. Do you think the foreign assistance program even in the
                        short term, nonetheless in the long term, had some effect in minimizing the
                        spread of communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well, I would break the past 50 years out. I should say the Marshall Plan
                    was effective in dealing with political problems, but that was an extraordinary
                    period. It was a period of rapid transition from war to peace, transition from a
                    period of terrible destruction, cataclysm to a period of peace, but had we not
                    been successful in helping the French, the Italians, the Germans, and the Brits
                    to survive the aftermath of the war, who knows where we would be today? At that
                    time , certainly it was effective. Thereafter, the analysis gets a bit more
                    difficult....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, subsequently. In the third world. Turkey is on the
                        margins of that. Of course it was beyond the Marshall Plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>JONNES: To my mind a country like India is a critical case. Critical in the sense
                    of magnitude of India. Critical in the sense of what is the role of aid? What do
                    we get out of it? Our political hostility, if you will, towards the Indians
                    because of their political flirtation with the Russians led to a variety of
                    problems it seems to me. If we could help the Indians to solve their problems of
                    this transition, their village based agriculture to modern industry as a nation,
                    it would be an extraordinary success. In point of fact, they do have a large
                    modern sector; they can solve part of the problem. But they still have a
                    terrible problem of primitive agriculture and the villages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have we over the years made any kind of useful
                        contribution in that kind of a transition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I would like to think so, but I haven't been close enough to it to know.
                    And perhaps not enough time has passed to judge. Certainly some of the
                    agricultural universities that we helped to set up, both research and
                    instructional universities, are successful I am told. They have helped in the
                    modernization of agriculture, but they have not solved the problem of
                    moneylenders; they have not solved the problem of politics of poverty. I would
                    want somebody like John Lewis to talk about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that the State Department or the foreign
                        policy interest of political security objectives was helpful to the
                        development process or undercut it in terms of foreign assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Difficult to say, I would pass on that. A case that I'm perfectly willing
                    to talk about is the one that I probably know best, Turkey. There it is now
                    increasingly difficult to see what is going to happen. In one dimension the
                    growth of Islamic fundamentalism is puzzling as the economic growth of Turkey is
                    a fact, and it is moving toward becoming a modern state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made references to short and long term. Perhaps there
                        was an effectiveness for the short term.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>JONNES: Yes. But then there is the question about the longer run, to what extent
                    has the process of development in Turkey succeeded in transforming life in the
                    villages and the life of the villager and what are the villagers now doing in
                    this democratic society (they do vote) to change the basic nature of the nation.
                    When Ataturk introduced his various reforms in the period of 1922 to 1938, he
                    apparently did not succeed in persuading the villagers that his separating out
                    the state from the church the shipping out of the caliphate and the true
                    secularization of Turkey was desirable.He didn't succeed in persuading them that
                    this is what should be done. And there has been this latent Islamic current
                    since that time. I've also mentioned that the military regards itself as the
                    defender of the Ataturk faith, not the Islamic faith, and there have been at
                    least three coups in various forms in Turkey since WWII. In each instance the
                    army intervened with the government because the army felt that the government
                    was undoing the Ataturk reform. And here we are again with a minority
                    government; which has a plurality and has to negotiate its way into power.
                    (Subsequently, after our discussions here, the Army intervened yet again to
                    change the Turkish government!). How does the nation finally resolve this? To
                    what extent does the process of growth and development, that we have in some
                    part made possible, work itself in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time you were there, these issues had not come
                        to the forefront?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Not explicitly to the forefront. One was aware that in the villages there
                    was this undercurrent of devout faith in Islam, but it was not really seen in
                    national politics. Actually, during our tour , the first man ultimately to
                    become prime minister who had his roots in this background, was coming to the
                    fore. He was the head of the state planning organization, he was an engineer,
                    trained in the United States, Turgut �zol. I believe he was a devout Moslem, but
                    he thought that modern technology could be married to Islam. Big question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In view of this dilemma, you wound up seeing issues that
                        became more prominent later on, and the others being able to do something
                        about them. Do you think that AID in its work tended to be foresighted in
                        trying to anticipate some of these issues, development issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I don't think so. In many cases we don't have a clue as an organization..
                    Individuals within the agency may well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably because they are so focused on the moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: That's right. I would like to think that in Turkey we achieved precisely
                    what we set out to achieve. As I mentioned, I went there in 1964. We were
                    working against a plan that would have the Turks out of concessional assistance
                    in say five years. Various events made this possible. Then for a variety of
                    other reasons it came apart, primarily on the political side.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which are issues beyond what we could reach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Quite beyond us. There was no solution in our instruction manuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking over your experience, what would you describe as
                        those development efforts or programs that seemed to work; why did they
                        work, what were some of the criteria for effective assistance ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Well I've already belabored what I would regard as a central issue, that
                    successful development requires some degree of political unity in the nation
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. But now to go down to the next level, assuming you
                        had that what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: It is easier to deal with infrastructure than with social problems. What
                    one can help with is the introduction of or the modernization of or the
                    transformation of infrastructure. One can deal with communications; one can deal
                    with transportation; one can deal with the generation of power. Each of these
                    sectors has its own problems obviously but these are elements that any nation in
                    the process of development is going to need, not least of all the training of
                    people. The question is to tailor it to the needs of the government and look at
                    it in terms of scarce resources. These are things one can do, and we've done
                    them quite well. In country after country in spite of what our critics say, we
                    have helped to build the dams, the transmission lines, the roads. More
                    importantly, we have helped to train the people of countries to run the
                    systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The institutional dimension?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, that of the infrastructure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the standard development sectors:
                        health, population, education, agriculture and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I believe that AID is effectively stopped from work in population. To my
                    mind, this is one of the great problems of our time. You see in our own country
                    where our rates of growth are quite different from other countries. But if we
                    don't solve this, I don't see how the process of development is going to
                    succeed...</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Yes, of course. By I think the name of the man is Helms. This is true
                    “Know-nothingism”. And of course the Church doesn't help much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the work we are doing; there is something going

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: Public health, I would really put that in with infrastructure because its
                    something that you can do; we have done. In Turkey it was extraordinary the
                    training in the states and the even greater effect of getting people who were
                    trained to come back and enroll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: In education? This is so close to the problem of cultural choices.
                    Heavens, even in the District of Columbia we have our problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the agricultural area? There was a period in
                        which the world could not feed itself. We don't hear that much now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: At least in the short run, we solved that problem. No, I think that the
                    general proposition that I was talking about earlier, that you do that which
                    helps to make agriculture as effective and efficient as possible. You have to
                    provide that agriculture sector with the infrastructure it needs to produce,
                    transport and dispose of its products. You do not engage in programs that
                    destroy the economic incentive of domestic producers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing a lot of work at the macro-economic level
                        as opposed to the sector level. How did you characterize what would be
                        effective in that area or was it all country specific?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>JONNES: Well, you have to be very careful of your trade policy. I think that in
                    the short run, you have to make sure that domestic producers would get a
                    reasonable return on whatever they are producing. You have to provide incentives
                    in the form of crop insurance. You have to educate in technological
                    improvements: the improvements of seeds, the use of fertilizer, and at the same
                    time try to strike a balance between what is possible and what is not possible
                    in basic societies. You have to build the silos to store as part of your
                    transportation system. It is the whole range, it seems to me, of agricultural
                    production that you want to look at. And then you have to look at the question
                    of how you get resources out of agriculture. The Russians had this nightmarish
                    problem that led to the deliberate starvation of God knows how many people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'm sure I mentioned a lot of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about AID as an organization? During the time you were

                        organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I thought that the Marshall Plan organization was just an extraordinary
                    group because it was done just for three or four years. It was put together
                    strictly ad-hoc. It consisted of some of the very best people out of the United
                    States out of industry, out of academia, out of government, out of the labor
                    movement, and it worked. It was really extraordinary. I know of no other word to
                    describe it. I consider myself very fortunate to have been able on occasion to
                    sit in these meetings in Paris — where I had no direct role — to listen to Paul
                    Hoffman, Averell Harriman and their advisors such as David Bruce, Lincoln
                    Gordon, and Dick Bissell as they were dealing with these problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>JONNES: Well, the raison d'�tre for our operations became very unclear after the
                    Marshall Plan. I mean there was the technical cooperation (Point 4) on one side
                    and there were the managers of financing (from the Development Loan Fund that
                    came into being was it in 1957? Retrospectively I have the impression that the
                    US government in the 1950's after the end of the Marshall Plan just didn't know
                    what it wanted to do with its aid programs.. The real beginning of AID came in
                    1961 with the Kennedy administration, with Fowler Hamilton and Dave Bell. The
                    latter is above all a development man, had been with the Harvard group out in
                    Pakistan and he knew the game and he also knew the US government, having been
                    the budget Director. If you will, he put the two together. Again we had a
                    remarkable group of people come in from all over the American community, not at
                    the same level as the Marshall Plan, but nonetheless, a formidable group.</p>
                <p>Q: How do you view it in your subsequent years after that initial period of AID?
                    JONNES: I think that with the advent of the Vietnam War, we like the rest of the
                    United States suffered. The deep differences that divided us once again left AID
                    unclear as to what was going on.We were involved with a massive program in
                    Vietnam which was really a very small part of the world's development problem.
                    We've just been steadily going downhill, and when I retired (I retired initially
                    in 1975) I did a list of 27 factors that impelled me to leave then. Certainly
                    number one had been my deep disillusion over the US policy in Vietnam, a
                    disillusion that extended to other elements of aid. But even had I been a hawk,
                    I would have contemplated retirement given the inability of the United States
                    government to pay its civil servants. I never could understand why we as civil
                    servants were called upon to bear the brunt of inflation during the 1960's. I
                    thought this was outrageous quite apart from my feelings about Vietnam . Another
                    factor in my getting out was the morass of our dealings with the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from Passman you found it very...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: He was just one part of my concern. The unceasing hostility from the
                    Congress, by-and-large to everything we were trying to do seemed to me to call
                    into question the judgment of the authors of our constitution in establishing
                    three branches of government. There were others on the hill who specialized in
                    baiting the civil service. Of course not all of them were that way, but people
                    such as Passman, Wayne Hayes, Clarence Long, Jesse Helms, Inouye, not to mention
                    their staff people who would take on all of the arrogance of their principals. I
                    think also of Fulbright s repeated rudeness to Dr. Hannah. I'd reached the point
                    that I needed no more of that sort of nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say to someone who expressed an interest in
                        going into international development today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES: I'd say it's a serious area of work. I would admire them certainly, and I
                    would wish them well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What aspect do you think they should go in to, the US
                        channels, strictly multi-lateral or other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>JONNES: I would tell them to avoid the US government, if only because of the
                    present near gridlock in the government between Congress and the Executive
                    Branch. Try the World Bank, the IMF, the regional development banks, the UN. One
                    of the small mysteries to me of the last years is how the World Bank has come
                    under such sharp attack for its policies, apparently led by the
                    environmentalists. I mean, I can understand there are questions arising from the
                    development process but my prejudice has always been “My gosh how can you
                    develop without breaking eggs?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's pause there and you can reflect on some of
                        these things. This has been a very interesting interview, very
                        worthwhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONNES Thanks. Indeed, let us pause here. Curious how irritated I can still
                    become when I contemplate some of contretemps of my time.</p>
