                <p>AMBASSADOR MALCOLM TOON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Dr. Henry E. Mattox </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 9, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Toon, let me start off this one, as I do on
                        occasion, by asking you how it was that you came to be interested in a
                        Foreign Service career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, I think primarily because I'm a first-generation American. My mother
                    and father were graduates of Ellis Island. They came from Scotland in 1912, I
                    think it was. And then we went back to Scotland when I was six years old. I
                    started my schooling over there, primarily because my folks discovered that
                    things were a little bit tougher here than they had anticipated. So the plan was
                    to move back completely, but then they discovered things were even tougher back
                    there, so they came back to this country. But while I was there—and I was a very
                    young person—I traveled quite a bit with my family and became interested in
                    foreign cultures and languages. Then I started my schooling at Tufts University,
                    and my interest in becoming a career diplomat intensified at that time.</p>
                <p>I passed my Foreign Service examinations just prior to World War II, but decided
                    that it was not really acceptable to go into the diplomatic service when we were
                    at war. So I went into the Navy for five years, mostly as a PT boat Skipper in
                    the south and southwest Pacific and then joined the diplomatic service right
                    after World War II when I was demobilized.</p>
                <p>At that time, unless you were a complete idiot, you had to recognize that the
                    real problem of the post-World War period was going to be the Soviet Union. So
                    after I joined the diplomatic service, I quickly opted for the Soviet specialist
                    program and then wound up, as you know, as ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have occasion to run into that other famous
                        PT boat skipper in the South Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: You mean Jack Kennedy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>TOON: Yes, I met him in Rendova just after I joined my squadron and just after he
                    had lost his boat. And then I met him again after he became President when I was
                    stationed in London. He came through after his meeting with Khrushchev in
                    Vienna. Since I was the Soviet specialist in the political section in the
                    embassy, I was assigned as his note-taker for his meetings with Macmillan, who
                    was then prime minister. But because of the way Kennedy operated, I never took
                    any notes. Kennedy and Macmillan met together alone. But I did have a chance to
                    chat with him again. I must say, to his credit and to my surprise, he remembered
                    our meeting during the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. He didn't have any occasion to say anything at that
                        time about his experience with Khrushchev in which common perception is that
                        he came out second best by far?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I don't agree with that. I think that if anybody misinterpreted the other,
                    it was Khrushchev who misinterpreted Kennedy. Khrushchev came away from that
                    meeting convinced that Kennedy was a lot softer than, in fact, he was. Not, I
                    think, primarily because of what went on at the meeting itself, but what had
                    gone on before the meeting—for example, the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Khrushchev had
                    read that as an indication of weakness on Kennedy's part. And, of course, that
                    was a mistake in judgment on his part, as we know, when the Cuban missile crisis
                    materialized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had occasion recently—this is just a sidelight—to
                        interview yet another PT boat skipper in the South Pacific at that time, a
                        fellow named Mike Holovak, who had been an all-American football player. Did
                        you ever run across him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I think I did. Certainly the name is familiar to me. I don't know whether I
                    met him in the South Pacific or back at Newport, Rhode Island, which was the PT
                    training base. Most of us came back from the Pacific to be what we call underway
                    instructors. I did meet him somewhere, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1945, he organized the Melville, Rhode Island, base
                        football team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Oh, yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had occasion to play that powerful Army team that
                        year; got slaughtered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I remember it very well, yes. That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was in connection with that, not foreign affairs, that
                        I interviewed Holovak.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Part of your fairly long career included a senior assignment as counselor for
                    political affairs in Moscow in the '60s and then shortly thereafter, four
                    ambassadorships to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Israel, and the Soviet Union. It
                    seems fairly obvious that the training for appointment as ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union—your training suited you and aimed you in that direction, it was
                    only logical that you became, eventually, ambassador to the Soviet Union. How is
                    it, however, that you became ambassador in Tel Aviv? How did that come
                    about?</p>
                <p>TOON: Well, that's an interesting story. Primarily because of Henry Kissinger,
                    who was Secretary of State, of course, when I went to Israel as ambassador.
                    Henry had become very upset with the Israelis, because he claimed that they had
                    sabotaged and ruined his diplomatic shuttle exercise. So he wanted to send, as
                    he put it, I think, rather crudely, “a tough-minded S.O.B.” to Israel as
                    ambassador in order to put the Israelis in their place.</p>
                <p>I had gained a reputation, whether justified or not—it depends on your own point
                    of view—of being rather blunt, outspoken, tough, in dealing, primarily, with
                    eastern Europeans and the Soviets. So Henry decided it would be a good idea to
                    send me there.</p>
                <p>Let me finish the story, because it is very interesting. Shortly after I arrived
                    in Israel, Henry wanted to resume his meetings with Rabin, who was then the
                    prime minister. Rabin was going to Germany on a state visit. Henry was coming
                    over for talks with the Germans. It was arranged that he would meet with Rabin
                    in Germany to resume, he hoped, the shuttle diplomacy exercise. I was summoned
                    to Germany, of course, as the new ambassador to Israel.</p>
                <p>When I was there, Kissinger said, “Now, I want to have a private word with you.”
                    And so we did. We had a long conversation before a formal dinner with the
                    Germans. He said, “Now, what I want you to do, as the American ambassador to
                    Israel, is get yourself out on the streets, meet the people, hold press
                    conferences, get yourself on television, meet all the members of the Knesset, if
                    necessary go behind the backs of the government to get the message across that
                    we have a new policy.” That policy, he said, was “to establish a good
                    relationship with the moderate Arab states, if necessary, by supplying them with
                    arms.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You want me, as the American ambassador, to behave this way in Israel?”
                    I pointed out, “No American ambassador has ever said, 'Boo,' has never uttered a
                    statement of substance. He has always been, more or less, in the Israeli
                    pocket.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, that's what I want you to do.”</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I've known Dr. Kissinger for many years. I knew him at Harvard and later in the
                    White House. We had always called each other Henry and Mac. But now he was
                    Secretary of State, and I addressed him as Mr. Secretary. I said, “Mr.
                    Secretary, I am going to ask you something that will probably make you really
                    mad, but I've got to know the answer. Does the President approve of this?”</p>
                <p>He got mad. He said, “Are you questioning my integrity? Are you questioning my
                    authority?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No. I just want to know if the President is behind this or not, because,
                    you know, this is a very tricky business that you are mandating.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, he's behind it.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>So I went to Israel, and Kissinger's prescription was basically the pattern of
                    behavior that I had to assume as ambassador. And it produced, frankly, a rather
                    abrasive relationship with the Israelis. They were not used to that sort of
                    behavior by the American ambassador. But I think, ultimately, what they decided
                    was that what I was telling them was for their own good. Because if, in fact, we
                    had a differently nuanced policy toward the Middle East that had developed, we
                    had to back our relations with the emerging moderate Arab states with heavy
                    equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they convinced that the changed policy was going to
                        remain changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I think they, ultimately, were convinced of that, not only on the basis of
                    what I was saying publicly in Israel, but also on the basis of their own
                    understanding as to what was going on inside Washington. And, ultimately, of
                    course, we did resume the diplomatic shuttle exercise with the end result of
                    winding up with the Sinai agreement—Sinai II, as it was called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in September '75, then, when Kissinger made
                        his last shuttle run, and the Sinai withdrawal began.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then, I guess, personified this new policy. You were
                        hand-picked to go and be abrasive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, that's the way it turned out. I think, initially, Dr. Kissinger
                    simply wanted to punish the Israelis by having a relatively unfriendly
                    ambassador in Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there no consideration, as far as you knew, about U.S.
                        domestic voting questions and problems in this new, revised Israeli
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, yes, consideration was given to that. Of course, there was a good
                    deal of consternation—more than that, disagreement—on the part of the American
                    Jewish community with what we were doing. Of course, they expressed their point
                    of view in no uncertain terms when they would come to see me in Israel. They
                    didn't like what I was saying. They felt that I was being unduly abrasive. I
                    tried to explain to them what I was telling the Israelis in my television
                    appearances and my talks with members of the Knesset was something that they had
                    to know.</p>
                <p>And, secondly, I said, “They've got to understand that you will help me, you as
                    members of the American Jewish community, in getting the message across that I
                    am not talking off the top of my head. I'm talking under instructions. And
                    they've got to understand that this change is going on back home. And I think,
                    frankly, it is a change for the better.” And I think, ultimately, the American
                    Jewish community came around to that point of view. Initially, it was not
                    easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an imbroglio in April '76 over the aid program.
                        It had to do, especially, with the transitional quarter, and how much was
                        going to be appropriated for the Israeli aid program in that unique
                        transitional quarter. You were heavily criticized at that time by the
                        Israeli press. Do you recall what that was all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, let me give you the background. I recall it very well. I had for a
                    long time after I arrived in Tel Aviv, resisted pressure, primarily by the
                    foreign correspondents, to hold press conferences. They knew that I had done
                    this sort of thing in my previous posts. They thought it would be a marvelous
                    opportunity to tap the most productive source of information in Israel, the
                    American ambassador. Well, finally, I agreed to meet with not only the foreign
                    press, but also the Israeli press on a background basis.</p>
                <p>Now the Israelis simply don't understand background rules. As you know, one is
                    not supposed to name the source, and one is not supposed to quote directly. But
                    one of the first questions that came up in this first backgrounder I had was
                    what did I think of the Israeli insistence on dealing directly with the Congress
                    on increasing the aid package, which the President had already reduced, because
                    he was facing very stringent fiscal problems at home.</p>

                <p>And I said, “Well, I think that is what I would call dirty pool. I think it is
                    wrong for the Israeli Embassy to go behind the back of the administration in
                    order to thwart the President's desire to give a reasonable, but a reduced, aid
                    package to the Israelis.” Well, that night on television, I was quoted directly,
                    and I was named as accusing the Israeli Government of violating the law by going
                    behind the back of the administration and seeking the agreement of the Congress
                    to an increased aid package. This made the Israeli Government furious, and it
                    made me furious, too. I never again had another background press conference in
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>Now, the Israelis who were there at the press conference claimed that they abided
                    by the rules. But they had briefed some of their colleagues, particularly on
                    television news programs, on the meeting with me, and it was they who had
                    violated the rules. And that's when the fat really hit the fire. For a long time
                    afterwards—I'd say about two or three months at least—my relations with the
                    Israeli public were very seriously strained. Not with the government
                    necessarily. The government was pressured, primarily by Begin, who was head of
                    the opposition, to demand an apology from me. Allon, who was the foreign
                    minister, said, “No, we are not going to do that.”</p>
                <p>But, in any case, the Israeli press reacted in a very angry way. Basically, their
                    line was, “Who is this Gentile to be preaching to us? We have been preached to
                    by Gentiles for centuries. We took care of them; we'll take care of him.” That,
                    basically, was the line carried by the press. So I had a very difficult time in
                    Israel for the first six months.</p>

                        like that where you live in a goldfish bowl. And this is triply so, of
                        course, in Israel, which is such a small country. The Israelis ended up
                        getting not much more than about 10% of what the original proposals were for
                        that transitional quarter, so your word must have had some effect. Can you
                        give me a word portrait of Rabin, Begin? Who was it that you dealt with
                        primarily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, I dealt primarily with Rabin, the prime minister; Allon, the foreign
                    minister; and Peres, who was the defense minister. These were the three top
                    officials in the Labor government. But I also had a good relationship with
                    Menachem Begin, who was head of the opposition. And this came about through
                    purely personal reasons. I played a lot of tennis when I was in Israel. And most
                    of my tennis playing partners were members of Begin's party, the Likud. They
                    brought me together with Begin for lunches and dinners and so forth. I got to
                    know him very well. He didn't agree with anything I said, but he did admire my
                    spirit—and he said this publicly. He felt that I was honest. I felt basically
                    the same way about him.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Now let me just wind up the story of my relationship with Begin, because it puts
                    me in the position of really not being much of an expert on the Middle East.
                    When I was appointed to Moscow in late 1976, and the Soviets finally accepted
                    me, Begin—still head of the opposition—asked to have a private lunch with me
                    down at the Knesset—the Israeli Parliament. I accepted and we had a very
                    pleasant lunch. In the course of the luncheon conversation, he said, “Now, I
                    would like to have a private word with you. I know you are going back to
                    Washington before you go on to Moscow. You will be seeing the Secretary of
                    State, of course, and the President.” So he took me over to the window of the
                    Knesset, which broadly overlooks the West Bank, and he said, “I want you to tell
                    the President when you get back that those lands out there, which you call the
                    West Bank—I will never call them the West Bank, I call them Judea and
                    Samaria—those lands have always been Jewish. They are Jewish today. And they
                    always will be Jewish.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I'll carry this message back, but I'm sure it is not going to be
                    embraced warmly by President Ford.” But I said, “You know, we are being very
                    frank with each other. Consistent with our relationship, which you very
                    accurately described—open and straight forward—let me give you some advice. Why
                    don't you get out of politics, because you don't really have a chance.” Three
                    months later, he became the prime minister.</p>
                <p>Then I went off to Moscow. And regularly, at least once a month, there would be
                    some emissary, usually a foreign diplomat, coming through Moscow with a message
                    for Ambassador Toon from Prime Minister Begin. That message, in effect, was,
                    “Tell the ambassador that I am the prime minister of Israel today, and I am
                    going to be the prime minister for many years to come.” That was my relationship
                    with Begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An unexpected sense of humor on the part of Begin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, he was a rather complex and interesting guy. I think in his later
                    years, he became a little bit too serious about events and a little bit too
                    insistent that his point of view was absolutely right, and nobody else had
                    anything to say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a friend in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, I don't remember
                        which, who called his house trying to get his wife before she died—and this
                        is an indication of what kind of country it is. It is really quite
                        remarkable to me. He answered the phone. The friend had to get through him
                        to get to the wife. There were no layers of bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Very informal.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peres? If something came in of a fair degree of
                        importance, and you were instructed to go to the foreign ministry—let's
                        assume it was something that you would handle yourself—who would you call up
                        to go see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I usually called up Eppie Evron, who was then a deputy foreign minister. He
                    would immediately arrange an appointment. I could see these people any time I
                    wanted to. They recognized that the American ambassador is a person of some
                    authority. And they also knew that when I wanted to see them, it was not to have
                    a chatty exchange of views, but to convey to them a message from Washington. So
                    I had no problem at all in seeing any of these people.</p>
                <p>Now they were three totally different guys. Rabin was deadly serious. He was a
                    military man primarily. He headed up the armed forces during the wars of
                    liberation. He had not much of a sense of humor. I got to know him very well,
                    primarily because we were both tennis players. He and his wife and I and my wife
                    used to play doubles on his court. I got to know him well, primarily because I
                    dealt one-on-one with him. He never had anyone with him, no note-takers. Nor did
                    I. But he was a serious guy and tough. Very tough, indeed. But I always felt
                    that he was completely honest. If he told me something, then I could rely upon
                    it.</p>
                <p>Allon was a much gentler guy, in the sense that he was much more personable and
                    friendly and outgoing and so forth. He was also a man of complete integrity, but
                    much more emotional than Rabin was. For example, he would react in a much more
                    emotional way to some of the things I would say than Rabin would.</p>
                <p>Peres was much more outgoing than either Rabin or Allon. When I would meet with
                    him, it would usually be late in the afternoon. He would always produce a bottle
                    of Scotch. And we had a little drink or two; a completely informal discussion.
                    But I always had the impression—and this may not sit very well today—that he was
                    a little bit slippery. I wasn't entirely sure that the point of view he was
                    conveying was going to be the point of view that he would convey to me tomorrow.
                    I may be wrong in my judgment of the guy, but that was my gut reaction during
                    the time.</p>
                <p>But, in any case, my relationship with all three was very good and close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Allon. You said something about his reaction would be—did
                        you use the word, emotional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Emotional, yes. Well, let me give you an example of that. I met with Allon,
                    together with a group of Congressmen, the day after we had taken a vote in the
                    United Nations which the Israelis didn't like. I think we had abstained on a
                    resolution condemning the Israelis for, as I recall, their settlement policy in
                    the West Bank. And when I met Allon the next day down in Jerusalem with the
                    congressional group, I said, “Good morning, Mr. Minister.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>He said: “It may be a good morning to you, but it's not to me after what happened
                    yesterday in the United Nations.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Let's talk about that later.” This was on television. The press were
                    there and so forth. And that's what I mean by acting in an emotional way. He got
                    over it before the day was out, but he and his colleagues were pretty mad about
                    the stance we had taken in the United Nations the day before.</p>
                <p>But, you know, Rabin would never show that sort of emotion. And Peres would just
                    sort of laugh it off under similar conditions. But Allon would always act in an
                    emotional way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an example of how an ambassador copes with a problem in
                        a country that he is assigned to, how did you cope with the remarks of Chief
                        of Staff General Brown about Israel being a burden rather than a defensive
                        asset? You were still in the country then, were you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: You are talking about the head of the armed forces Brown? Which Brown are
                    you talking about?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General Brown, the chief of the—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: You don't mean Harold Brown, who was later on Secretary of Defense. You are
                    not talking about him. You are talking about General Brown?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Mid-October 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Yes, I remember that remark. I tend to agree that Brown's assessment is
                    correct. We tend to overdo the idea that the Israelis are a great strategic
                    bastion for us in the Middle East. I think, frankly, they are a very serious
                    burden for us. Now don't misunderstand me. I believe in our policy vis � vis
                    Israel. I think that we should be committed to Israel's survival. It is not only
                    a moral commitment on our part, but it is one that seems to be totally
                    understandable after what happened to the Jews in World War II. Therefore, I
                    think that we should do everything in our power to make sure that Israel
                    survives. But to call the Israelis, as members of the American Jewish community
                    do frequently, a strong strategic asset in the Middle East, I think simply
                    overstates the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my experience, much more limited than yours, of course,
                        the Israelis react immediately to any hint of criticism. And they react very
                        strongly. They must have reacted to this particular criticism. You had to go
                        deal with it in some fashion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>TOON: Well, in the first place, they don't like to be told what to do. They don't
                    like somebody looking over their shoulder on their internal policies and
                    activities—for example, the settlement policy in the West Bank. And they don't
                    like to be told that they are not terribly important strategically. So this was
                    a problem that I had to smooth over. But at the same time, I think I did it in
                    such a way as not to negate what General Brown had said, because, as I said
                    before, I agree with that sort of assessment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can guess what you did to smooth it over, but let me ask
                        you to make it explicit. What did you do? Did you go to see Rabin? Did Rabin
                        call you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: No, I think this was a question that I discussed with Peres, the minister
                    of defense. And as I recall, I did not ask to see him specifically. I was down
                    there in his office. His office was in Tel Aviv. It was much easier for me to
                    see him than it was to see Allon or Rabin, whose offices were in Jerusalem,
                    which was quite a long way off. And I think I was down there on some other
                    issue, probably it was with regard to what was going on in Lebanon. That
                    statement by General Brown came up, and I tried to put the proper gloss on it
                    without, as I say, negating what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever discuss U.S.-Israeli affairs with President
                        Ford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Yes, a number of times, as a matter of fact. I came back on consultation, I
                    would say, about five or six times while I was ambassador in Israel usually with
                    other ambassadors from the Middle East, who were summoned back to meet with
                    Kissinger. When we met with Kissinger, we would also meet with President
                    Ford.</p>
                <p>Now because of the relationship at that time between the Arab states and Israel,
                    which was nonexistent, of course, I, at the insistence of some of the Middle
                    East ambassadors, would meet separately with President Ford rather than together
                    with them. This, I think, gave me a leg up on all the other ambassadors, because
                    I got to know the President quite well. I think not only was he a very fine guy,
                    but a guy that showed very good understanding of the problems in the Middle
                    East.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TOON: It was primarily Eilts that took this position, but I think he was aided
                    and abetted by other Arabists, and certainly nobody else took the opposite
                    side.</p>

                        The stock question might be what were the policy questions facing you when
                        you arrived at your post in Tel Aviv. In your case, it would be far
                        different. It would not be run-of-the-mill policy questions at all. You were
                        instructed specifically by the Secretary of State that 180-degree or
                        90-degree turn in American policy was about to take place or was taking

                </p>
                <p>TOON: I wouldn't say it was a 180 degree shift. It was a slightly different
                    emphasis in our policy in the Middle East. There was no attempt by anybody to
                    diminish our commitment to Israel's survival. No question about that. What we
                    were doing was trying to work out an arrangement so that Israel's survival could
                    be assured, not militarily, but politically, by a different set of relationships
                    in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Now that was a nuanced policy which was not easy to get across to the hard-headed
                    Israelis who had participated in the struggle for survival. First of all, they
                    felt they had become independent and had survived exclusively through military
                    means. It was also not easy to convince them that through supply of arms to the
                    moderate Arab states that this would advance the Israeli interests. That was a
                    very difficult point to get across. They could understand, and they admitted
                    this to me several times, why we felt it was necessary to establish a good
                    relationship with the moderate Arab states. What they could not understand was
                    why we had to support this policy with a supply of arms. They did not believe me
                    or Henry Kissinger when we said, “Look, under no conditions will this supply of
                    arms be extensive. And, certainly, we will not supply them with any arms that
                    you would regard as being offensive and dangerous to your survival.” But they
                    simply didn't believe that.</p>
                <p>They said, “Once you start down this road—in the first place, what is the
                    difference between an offensive and a defensive weapon? But once you start down
                    this road, their appetite will increase, and you will find yourselves supplying
                    them with all kinds of arms, which in the long run will represent a threat to
                    us.” That was their position. Because it was strongly held, it was not easy for
                    us to get the point across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was after you left, two or three or four years
                        later, but one might be able to say they were right, because we developed a
                        military relationship with Egypt that was, and is, quite extensive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>TOON: Well, there the problem, it seems to me, was that if in fact we wanted to
                    completely wean Egypt away from Soviet influence, we had to agree to substitute
                    for the Soviets in their arms supply role. Egyptians felt strongly that they
                    could not be left naked. If they were to break relations with the Soviets, as
                    happened, of course, and, therefore, cut off their arms supply, they had to
                    protect themselves. They had to be able to defend themselves. Therefore, they
                    insisted that we take the Soviets' place in this respect. But we did it not on
                    the Soviet scale. We did it, I think, in a very restrained way.</p>
                <p>But I think, frankly, the policy has worked out, not only to our advantage, but
                    ultimately to the Israeli advantage. You now have a situation—and this came
                    about shortly after I left Israel—in which really no substantial war is
                    possible, because Egypt was pulled out of the picture completely. And I think
                    that has been a great plus, not only from our position, but also from the
                    standpoint of Israel. Now it is not easy for them to swallow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw some of that from the other end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Your staff there, your political officers and your DCMs and your economic
                    officers, were they all, in your opinion, then first-rate? Did you have really
                    almost the pick of the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>TOON: I would say that certainly my DCM, whom I personally selected, was very
                    good. Some of the other senior officers were not that good, in my opinion. I had
                    one junior officer who was fluent in Hebrew, and he was very helpful to me. But
                    the others were, I would say, no more than average.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, an average FSO was an accomplished kind of person.
                        How is it that they fell down? The lack of writing ability, or lack of
                        ability to develop information out on the streets, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, I think primarily because they had operated under entirely different
                    leadership prior to my arrival. Their two previous bosses had been Ken Keating,
                    a political appointee who spent most of his time attending socials and that sort
                    of thing and did not really participate in the formulation of policy vis � vis
                    Israel. And, of course, his predecessor was Wally Barbour, who had been there
                    altogether too long. He had been there almost, I think it was, thirteen years as
                    ambassador. No ambassador should remain in any country for more than three
                    years, in my view, and certainly not something like thirteen in a country like
                    Israel. It is difficult to avoid localitis in dealing with the Israelis.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The result was that these younger officers of the staff had felt that they were
                    not participating in the process under my predecessors. They felt cut out
                    completely, because the embassy was cut out. And Kissinger was wheeling and
                    dealing on his own. In many cases, Keating wouldn't even be told what was going
                    on. Now that changed completely when I came, primarily because Kissinger knew
                    that I wouldn't tolerate that sort of treatment. I would resign rather than be
                    handled the way my predecessors were. So they found themselves working in a
                    totally different milieu—and they weren't used to it.</p>
                <p>Now, the other problem was that a good many of the things I did, I had to do
                    alone, primarily because Dr. Kissinger was the sort of guy that wanted to keep
                    things very close to his chest. I think he would have been pretty mad if I had
                    briefed my staff completely on what was going on. I did tell the senior officers
                    basically what we were doing, but not in complete detail about my conversations
                    with the Israeli leadership. I think that came about primarily because I didn't
                    have the sort of confidence in them that I had, for example, in my staff in
                    Moscow later on. Now there you had really good professionals, most of whom were
                    in the Soviet Union on a second tour of duty, most of whom knew the language
                    thoroughly. This was not the case in Tel Aviv. Most of them were there for, you
                    know, a first-and-only tour of duty. None of them, except for one officer that I
                    mentioned, knew the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this first-rate DCM that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Dunnigan. Tom Dunnigan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thomas Dunnigan, yes. I've heard, somewhere along the
                        line, of an officer or two who took language specialization in Hebrew and
                        Arabic, trying to get themselves totally qualified for the area. That must
                        be mind-boggling to try to deal with those two languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Nobody in my experience did that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You lasted there a year or so, a year and a half,
                        something of that sort. Then you were picked by President Ford to go to the
                        Soviet Union. Moscow would not accept you at first, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>TOON: Yes, but let me tell you a little about what I call the saga of my
                    appointment to Moscow. I was first appointed ambassador to Moscow by Nixon in
                    1973 when I was serving as ambassador in Belgrade. I received a telegram over
                    the weekend in what we call the agreement channel, which pertains to
                    ambassadorial appointments, from the Under Secretary of Management, who said
                    that President Nixon had decided to send me to Moscow as ambassador, that they
                    were updating my FBI check, but that the Department wanted to know now if this
                    gave me any personal problems before going further down the road.</p>
                <p>Well, it did give me a really serious personal problem. That was my wife's
                    attitude. We had spent, I would say, at that point, about five years in the
                    Soviet Union under very difficult conditions. I was there first as a third
                    secretary when Stalin was running the show. We had no maid. The tap had been
                    turned off by Stalin. Since my wife spoke no Russian then, I had to do the
                    shopping. It was a very unpleasant time. It was a little bit better when I was
                    counselor of embassy in the '60s, but not much. One still felt one was
                    surrounded by the enemy. So that I knew that I would have a problem with my
                    wife.</p>
                <p>Well, when I received this telegram, I gave my wife a ring at home—it was a
                    Saturday. I said, “Look, I am coming home for lunch, since we have a very
                    serious problem to discuss. Why don't you crank up a few martinis, and we will
                    get to it.” So I went home for lunch.</p>
                <p>She said, after a martini or two, “What is the problem you want to discuss with
                    me?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, President Nixon wants us to go to Moscow as ambassador.”</p>
                <p>And she said, “Over my dead body.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I am not willing to pay that price.” I finally convinced her that
                    it was very difficult for an ambassador to say no to the White House. If the
                    President wants you to go somewhere, you go. I said, “After all, you and I have
                    been partners in this difficult diplomatic business for years now. I don't think
                    you should say no.”</p>
                <p>Well, she said, “All right, but only for two years.”</p>
                <p>I sent a message back to Washington that weekend saying, “Flattered, honored, and
                    so forth. Let me know as soon as possible when I can tell Tito,” I had a very
                    good relationship with Tito and I felt he should know as soon as possible that I
                    would be leaving. I said, “He is going to be pretty mad if he learns first from
                    the press that I am going to Moscow as ambassador, so make sure that I can tell
                    him before this is publicized.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And I got word back on Monday saying that they understood my relationship with
                    Tito, and they would get word to me as soon as possible. That afternoon, I got
                    another cable from Washington saying, “There has been an apparent change of
                    signals at the White House. It is doubly important that you tell no one about
                    this appointment. We will clarify the situation and get word to you, as soon as
                    possible.”</p>
                <p>I called in my secretary, and I dictated what undoubtedly would be regarded as a
                    very irascible message to Washington saying that, in effect, “If, as I suspect,
                    the Soviets have tried to muck-up this appointment, I want my day in court
                    before the final decision is taken.” And I said to my secretary, “Send it off. I
                    don't want to see it in draft. Just send it, I don't want to change it.” And the
                    message went as dictated.</p>
                <p>Then I got a telegram back the next morning, which was Tuesday, saying in effect:
                    “You are wrong. The Soviets have nothing to do with this. Understand your
                    concern, will clarify the situation as soon as possible and let you know.” I
                    received no further word from Washington about that appointment. And we went
                    without an ambassador for a whole year in Moscow. Spike Dubs was charg� for the
                    most part. And then Walt Stoessel, who was then Assistant Secretary of State,
                    was appointed in December as ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                <p>Now I tried to find out from Bill Rogers, who was the Secretary of State, and
                    Walt Stoessel, who was his Assistant Secretary to European Affairs, what had
                    happened to my appointment. They couldn't find out. They just kept putting my
                    name before the White House, and the answer was dead silence from the Oval
                    Office. I finally discovered from correspondents, whom I knew well and who were
                    covering the Washington scene, what had happened.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger was then National Security Advisor in the White House. When Nixon
                    had decided to send me to Moscow as ambassador, he had a drink with the Soviet
                    ambassador, Dobrynin. Kissinger said, you know, “The President has decided to
                    send Mac Toon to Moscow as ambassador.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So to continue. Kissinger had a drink with Dobrynin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: And Kissinger said to Dobrynin, “The President has decided to send Mac Toon
                    to Moscow as ambassador.”</p>
                <p>Dobrynin said, “That's the end of d�tente,” which was nonsense. No matter how
                    powerful an ambassador you are, you don't carry out your own policy. The policy
                    at that time happened to be d�tente. Therefore, obviously, I would carry it
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>But Kissinger sent a back channel message to Moscow, “Don't ask for agreement for
                    Ambassador Toon until you hear further from me.” And that was the end of it.
                    When Kissinger became Secretary of State, he revived the whole idea of sending
                    me to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He must have had a bad conscience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: No, I think he probably recognized that it was time to send somebody there
                    who, in the first place, could report back accurately what the Soviet positions
                    were and, secondly, who could be tough and outspoken with the Soviets, if
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>In any case, you are right. What happened was that the Soviets sat on my
                    appointment, my agreement, for almost three months. That's unprecedented, as you
                    know. In fact, it is almost unprecedented for any host government to turn down
                    an ambassadorial appointee unless he happens to be a convicted felon or
                    something like that. But they didn't turn me down; they just did not act on it.
                    The assumption was that if they just sat on their hands and quietly passed the
                    word that Toon was not really the ideal man for the Moscow job from their point
                    of view, that President Ford would change his mind. And Kissinger would change
                    his mind. But to their credit, the President and the Secretary of State stood
                    firm. They said, “Under no conditions will we change the appointment.”</p>
                <p>Then it was assumed that what the Soviets were doing was waiting until the
                    election. As you know, Carter beat Ford. So it seemed likely that the Soviets
                    would just wait it out, and Carter would appoint somebody else.</p>
                <p>What happened was—again I behaved in my usual cantankerous and irascible way—I
                    called in my secretary in November to send a personal message to Kissinger.
                    “What the Soviets are doing is absolutely unacceptable conduct. Don't
                    misunderstand this message. It has nothing to do with me personally. I've had a
                    good career. I've headed three embassies, important missions, and I have no
                    complaint. But what is at stake is the good name of the United States. You
                    simply cannot tolerate Soviet refusal to accept an appointment by the President
                    of the United States. My advice to you is to call in Ambassador Dobrynin—he was
                    then, I think, in his twenty-third year as ambassador—and tell him that unless
                    we, the United States, receive positive word on Toon's appointment within
                    forty-eight hours, you, Mr. Ambassador, will pack your bags and go home and we
                    will get along without ambassadors.”</p>
                <p>Well, within forty-eight hours, I received a telephone call from Washington at
                    4:00 in the morning—Washington never has had a clear understanding of time
                    differentials—saying that the Soviets had accepted me. The President and
                    Kissinger wanted me back in Washington in time to arrive in Moscow before the
                    end of the year.</p>

                <p>TOON: Late '76. And so when I got back to Washington, I was met at the airport by
                    a junior officer who said, “The Secretary wants to see you right away.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Sure.” I went in to Mr. Kissinger's office, and I said, “What
                    happened?”</p>
                <p>“What happened? We followed your advice.”</p>
                <p>This is a very interesting development, because it meant that the Soviet Union
                    attached great importance to having Dobrynin stay on in Washington. After all,
                    he was a very effective guy. As I have said publicly, he snookered so many
                    Presidents and Secretaries of State down through the years, that the Soviets
                    felt they could not, you know, pay the price of having him leave. They were
                    willing to accept me in exchange for keeping Dobrynin down in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I dare say Dobrynin sent a very persuasive cable
                        back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were appointed in January. The Senate confirmed you,
                        oddly, in June, because the Congress was out of session for a while. When
                        did you actually go to Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, that's not quite accurate. I went to Moscow in December of '76. I
                    presented my credentials to Podgorny, who was then head of state, in January,
                    and I was then the ambassador.</p>
                <p>Now when Carter came in—well, before Carter came in, when he was trying to
                    arrange his administration, he was advised—I found this out later—by people I
                    thought were good friends of mine but who turned out not to be—to like Governor
                    Harriman—dump me as the ambassador and replace me with a businessman in order to
                    convey a positive gesture to the Brezhnev leadership. I heard about this through
                    the grapevine—again mostly from correspondents.</p>
                <p>Then shortly after Carter was inaugurated and entered on duty as President, the
                    brains from Plains around Carter—as I have described the President's
                    staff—discovered that there were fifty-six interim appointments about to be
                    confirmed by the Senate. As you know, interim appointees had to be confirmed
                    within five days of the reconvened Senate, or the appointments lapse. So the
                    people around Carter decided that they better pull these names back. And they
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Of these interim appointees, there were four ambassadors; all the rest of them
                    were purely political appointees for domestic jobs. But there were four
                    ambassadors. One was a purely political appointee; I think he was ambassador to
                    Jamaica. Another was the ambassador to Botswana—another was the ambassador to
                    Malta—neither was an important post. And the other one was myself.</p>
                <p>Overnight, there were headlines all around the world, “Carter cancels Toon's
                    appointment.” I began receiving phone calls from my Ambassadorial colleagues in
                    Moscow saying, “Gee, sorry, old man, that you have to go. We are just
                    establishing a good relationship.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What a minute. I'm not going anywhere. As far as I'm concerned, this is
                    a pure technicality, but we will have to wait and see.” But it took Carter, I
                    would say, at least two months to decide to keep me on.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I was in limbo in Moscow. I had not met the President—I hadn't really
                    ever heard of him before he became President. I knew some of the members of the
                    Cabinet, Harold Brown and Vance in particular, but I had not met them as members
                    of his Cabinet. I had not been privy to the formulation, for example, of our
                    arms-control package, which later turned out to be a complete fiasco. I felt out
                    of things and somewhat in limbo. I kept saying to Vance in my cables: “Look, I
                    would like to come back and talk to you and give you the Moscow ambassador's
                    point of view on what the nuances of our policy should be toward Brezhnev and
                    his regime.”</p>
                <p>“No, it would be very awkward at this time until the President decides what to
                    do,” Vance replied.</p>
                <p>Well, Carter finally decided to keep me on, but later I found out—primarily from
                    Jody Powell—that the only reason he decided to keep me on was that he was told
                    through Jody Powell by the American press that if he dumped me, he would be
                    accused of being soft on the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long before you came back to meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I think it was in early June of '77. Meanwhile, Vance had come to Moscow.
                    And I had about forty minutes with the President—a private conversation in the
                    Oval Office. I found him to be a very warm, decent human being, but a man with
                    some rather strange ideas about the Soviet Union. I came out of that
                    conversation and went right to Brzezinski's office—I had known Brzezinski for
                    years—and I said, “You've got a big problem on your hands. You've got to teach
                    this man the facts of political life. He thinks that there is a warm bond of
                    friendship between Brezhnev and himself. And he thinks that he and Brezhnev are
                    pursuing basically the same political objectives: peace and stability throughout
                    the world.” I said, “That's not true.” So I said, “You've got a big job ahead of
                    you.” Frankly, I had to deal with this problem in my relationship with President
                    Carter, and to a lesser extent, with Cy Vance throughout my entire
                    stewardship.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the two were known for opposing views—Brzezinski and
                        Vance—on the Soviet Union and on U.S.-Soviet relationships. Therefore, you
                        would, I gather, come down on the side of Brzezinski on these
                        conflicts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Philosophically, I think Brzezinski and I were much closer soulmates than
                    Cy Vance and I were. I am very fond of Cy Vance. He is a great human being. But,
                    again, really a Pole has a much better understanding of the Soviet Union than a
                    Brahmin from Yale—and that is Brzezinski's background. But Cy and I simply
                    didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things. And Carter and I didn't agree on a
                    number of issues. Finally, I decided that I was not really getting through to
                    Washington the way I thought I should. Furthermore, I had had almost three years
                    of ambassador to Moscow. My wife and I had spent almost eight years in that
                    benighted capital. I decided that it was time to move on to retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't let this go. You spoke of arms-control fiasco. Is
                        that SALT II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: No, I thought the SALT II agreement was a good agreement. I had in mind the
                    first arms-control package that Vance brought to Moscow in March 1977. As I told
                    you before, Vance had told me by cable and by telephone that it would be awkward
                    for me to come back to Washington, but he did want to get my slant before coming
                    in to Moscow. Would I meet him in Brussels where he was going to brief the North
                    Atlantic Council before meeting with the Soviet leadership?</p>
                <p>So I went out to Brussels, and Vance and I sat together on the plane on the way
                    to Moscow. He said, “Well, what do you think of the arms-control package that I
                    am bringing to Moscow?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I would be in a better position to answer that question if I knew what
                    was in the package.”</p>
                <p>He was shocked. He said, “Didn't Brzezinski send it to you?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, I don't have a clue.” Well, then he described it in great detail.
                    And I said, “Now, Mr. Secretary”—even an Ambassador doesn't call the Secretary
                    of State by his first name—I said, “This is not going to fly. The Soviets are
                    going to reject this out of hand. Frankly, I think what you are doing is what
                    your predecessor once said was a very dangerous thing to do to the Soviets,
                    you'll spook them.”</p>
                <p>Vance was shocked to hear this. He presented it to the Soviets in Moscow, and
                    they did exactly what I told Vance they would do. So then my credibility, I
                    think, went up somewhat in Washington after that happened.</p>

                        of your time. I would like to get, though, for the record, your impressions
                        of Brezhnev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, you have to understand that throughout my stewardship as ambassador,
                    Brezhnev was not in good shape. He was seriously ailing to the point where, at
                    the end, his colleagues had to sort of prop him up in order to permit him to
                    make a speech. I saw him eight times, which is more than any other American
                    ambassador in Moscow had seen the top man in the Soviet leadership for years.
                    But I can't say that I ever had a good give and take with the guy, and I speak
                    fluent Russian, of course. He always read from a position paper. Half the time,
                    he didn't make any sense. Half the time, the interpreter, who was usually
                    Sukhodrev, would interpret something which didn't come out of Brezhnev's lips at
                    all. That was one of the advantages of knowing the language. There were times
                    when he seemed to be in reasonably good shape, but I would say that, basically,
                    he was not a very healthy man while I was ambassador.</p>
                <p>Gromyko, of course, I dealt with regularly. Gromyko I could see within an hour's
                    notice. He knew that I was not going to waste his time. He knew that I would be
                    speaking under instructions. I have great respect for Gromyko as a professional
                    diplomat. I disagree with everything he has said and done down through the
                    years, but he was a real professional. He would tell you, in no uncertain terms,
                    that “I was there. I attended that conference. And I know what went on.” Usually
                    we didn't even have an adequate record of what went on. So he had a leg up on
                    certainly every ambassador in Moscow, and a leg up on, I think, every Secretary
                    of State or every foreign minister in the Western world because of his vast
                    experience and his involvement in principal policy issues for over forty
                    years.</p>
                <p>But with Brezhnev, it was, you know, a good formal relationship in the sense that
                    I could see him frequently, but I never felt confident that he was really on top
                    of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got there in '76, d�tente of previous
                        years had pretty well collapsed anyway, had it not? Perhaps in the final
                        days of the Vietnam War.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TOON: Well, certainly, we did not have the sort of chummy relationship that had
                    existed between the Nixon-Kissinger team on our side and the
                    Brezhnev-Kosygin-Podgorny group on the other side. But if you mean by d�tente a
                    continuing dialogue with the Soviets, a continuing attempt on the part of both
                    sides to bring about increased stability in our relationship, I think d�tente
                    continued. And after all, we did, during my years in Moscow, negotiate the SALT
                    II treaty, which, of course, was never ratified, primarily because of Soviet
                    misbehavior. I would think that down through the Ford and Carter years we had a
                    relationship which I think is absolutely essential in Moscow. That is, a
                    relationship which would provide for a continuing dialogue with the Soviet Union
                    primarily to make sure that they don't make a mistake in judgment and get our
                    two countries in a position of military confrontation, which in my view would
                    inevitably result in a nuclear exchange and the end of civilization.</p>
                <p>Now we did have that sort of relationship under Ford and Carter when I served as
                    ambassador, but not the sort of chummy relationship that existed under
                    Nixon-Kissinger, which I think, frankly, was misguided. The problem with the
                    relationship when Nixon and Kissinger were in office was that d�tente was
                    oversold to the American public. I think Henry Kissinger today would admit this.
                    The idea got across to our fellow Americans that, we were dealing with a
                    basically changed Soviet Union. That was not the case at all. So what happened
                    was, I think, a much more sensible and sensitive assessment of the Soviet threat
                    in the Ford-Carter years than we had under toward the end of the Nixon-Kissinger
                    regime.</p>

                        your stewardship. I am raising it because d�tente really, as I think of it
                        anyway, is an aura, an atmosphere, a feeling. It was chummy, as you said, at
                        one time. It became less chummy. Now it is chummy in spades again. What is
                        your opinion, now in 1989, of the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Well, I would agree it became chummy in spades again under Mr. Reagan. I
                    think Mr. Reagan never really understood what was going on. Gorbachev was on top
                    of Reagan at all the summit conferences, and I think, frankly, most of us who
                    know something about the Soviet problem were very uneasy with Mr. Reagan at the
                    helm in dealing one-on-one with Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>Now I don't feel that way with George Bush. I've known George Bush for many
                    years. I know that this is a guy that does his homework well. He doesn't have
                    laid-back weekends at Camp David the way Mr. Reagan did. He doesn't spend his
                    evenings watching class-B movies. He is a very serious guy. Therefore, I feel
                    reasonably confident—don't misunderstand me—I don't agree with many one-on-one
                    meetings with the Soviet leadership, but I am not uneasy about Mr. Bush meeting
                    with Gorbachev. I think we probably have a safer relationship now. I would hope
                    we would not revert to the sort of chummy relationship that we had under Mr.
                    Reagan.</p>

                    of the Soviet regime. Well, I found myself in the position of either rebutting
                    the President or speaking the truth. I knew there would be problems back in
                    Moscow. I think the same thing is true of some of the other things I said. But
                    they were in response to questions primarily. I have always felt that it is an
                    ambassador's responsibility, particularly the American ambassador in Moscow, to
                    be perfectly straight with his own countrymen as to what is going on inside the
                    Soviet Union and not to cover-up in an effort to promote d�tente, if you want to
                    call it that, or, in any case, a chummy relationship between ourselves and the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>Now, perhaps it would have been wiser if I had been less abrasive in my remarks.
                    But if you look carefully at the speech that I made in Atlanta, you will find
                    that it is a very strong endorsement of a continuing close relationship with the
                    Moscow leadership. When I got back to Moscow—I had been blasted by Pravda the
                    day before I arrived—I held a press conference in which I said that I'm just
                    sorry that the Soviet leadership and the Soviet media did not choose to read the
                    entire text of my remarks, because I think inevitably they would have concluded
                    that I was trying to endorse what I think is the sort of thing that they want to
                    see happen. That is, a good, close relationship with Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You recall, I'm sure, that the same thing happened with
                        George Kennan at one stage.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>TOON: I was there when that happened. I was a third secretary in the embassy
                    under George Kennan. Let me if I may, give you the nature of the relationship
                    between myself and George Kennan. I, together with another junior officer, wrote
                    a paper called, “After Containment, What?” Now, we wrote this paper before we
                    knew that Kennan was to be our ambassador. I may have been brash, but I wasn't
                    stupid. I certainly would never have written this paper if I had known he was
                    going to be our ambassador. The paper was submitted to the serious essay contest
                    in the Foreign Service Journal.</p>
                <p>Kennan was then named the ambassador. This other young officer and I were just
                    quaking in our boots as to what would happen to us. “Friends” of ours in
                    Washington gave the paper to Kennan to read during his briefings. Kennan's
                    reaction was, in effect: Get the scorpions off the premises. He started the
                    wheels turning for our transfers. I was transferred before my term was up. I was
                    transferred after eighteen months. But I stayed there a lot longer than George
                    Kennan, because he was booted out, as you know.</p>
                <p>But the interesting thing is that the only time that I was in the foreign office
                    was when I went down with the Charg� d'affaires, who I think was Jack McSweeney
                    at the time, to receive the note from Vyshinsky, who was then foreign
                    minister—he was a terrible character who presided over the purge trials in the
                    late 1930s—declaring George Kennan persona non grata. That was the only time I
                    was in the foreign office in my first tour of duty in Moscow.</p>
                <p>Now since then, Kennan and I have developed a very good, close relationship. We
                    don't agree on a number of issues, but we see each other frequently. As he told
                    me in Berlin after he had retired—you will recall that he was ticked off, he was
                    finished, and he went to Princeton. He came to Berlin, when I was stationed
                    there, to deliver the Ernst Reuter memorial lectures, which he did beautifully
                    in fluent German. I was sort of his escort officer. He asked to see me
                    privately. He said, “You know, Mac, some of us who think we are adults, behave
                    like children. I want to apologize to you for my behavior toward you in
                    Moscow.”</p>
                <p>Instead of having the grace to say, “Gosh, that's great, Mr. Kennan,” I said,
                    “Well, I'm just sorry you didn't feel that way in Moscow, because my career is
                    just about ruined.” There is no question that I had a very difficult time
                    recovering from my transfer from Moscow and from the efficiency reports that
                    were written on me at Kennan's instigation. I finally was reasonably successful.
                    But since then, we have developed a good personal relationship, and all the
                    sordid past is forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a fascinating sidelight. Even way back then, I
                        think Kennan was declaring that large elements of what we had known as
                        containment was not really what he meant, and he disagreed with certain NSC
                        68 conclusions and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>TOON: Well, he felt—I have never been entirely sure that he was right about
                    this—that his views were misinterpreted by people back in Washington who wanted
                    to translate them into the need for building up a strong military posture and
                    developing a military alliance such as NATO. He claims that he never had that in
                    mind at all. If you go back and read the Mr. X article or the long telegram from
                    Moscow, it seems to be more or less inevitable that you could come to that
                    interpretation of what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have read them many times, and I was puzzled about that
                        myself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You left. Thomas Watson, Jr. succeeded you in Moscow. You criticized the
                    appointment of a nonprofessional. You criticized, at that time, the Washington
                    practice of using Dobrynin as a major channel of communication with Moscow. This
                    is similar to what happens, I understand, all the time in our relations with
                    London. The British Embassy in Washington is used as a channel for
                    communications.</p>
                <p>TOON: But there, there is a good reason for it. Usually we don't have a very
                    competent man serving as ambassador to London.</p>
                <p>But let me just say a word about, as you correctly pointed out, my criticism of
                    the Watson appointment. I made clear that this was not directed at Watson
                    personally. I knew the guy well. He was head of the Arms Control Advisory
                    Committee when I was ambassador in Moscow. I would see him every time I came
                    back to Washington. I had known him in other capacities. He is a very decent
                    human being and a terribly nice guy. But not a guy with any obvious
                    qualifications for the Moscow job. I felt strongly that this job, which had been
                    in career hands for something like twenty years, ought to remain in career
                    hands, because it was terribly important, I felt, from Washington's point of
                    view to know or to have an expert's assessment as to what was going on inside
                    the Soviet Union, what the views of the Soviet leadership were. You cannot do
                    this without knowing the language. You have to be able to read what the Soviets
                    are telling their own people and so forth. It was for that reason that I felt it
                    was a misguided appointment.</p>
                <p>Now Watson, in fairness to him, never really had a chance to demonstrate that a
                    businessman could run a good mission in Moscow, because shortly after he got
                    there, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and our relationship went down the
                    drain. But I still feel strongly that our interests are far better served,
                    frankly and speaking completely subjectively, if we had a career man serving in
                    every mission overseas. Now that is totally unrealistic, I recognize, given the
                    nature of our political process. But at least in those sensitive posts where it
                    is terribly important for us to try to know exactly what is going on, we ought
                    to have a real professional. I think, frankly, we made a mistake by sending
                    Watson to Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Now as far as my criticism of Washington's dealing with Dobrynin is concerned, I
                    have always felt that if you are speaking to a government which doesn't have a
                    really good understanding as to your political process, which is true of
                    Moscow—less true now under Gorbachev, but certainly true under Brezhnev—who
                    don't really understand how Washington operates, then you are far better off if
                    you speak through your ambassador to make sure that your point of view gets
                    across without any embellishment or distortion. You are in a position, as the
                    American ambassador, to explain what your policies and your positions are. Now,
                    as for speaking through Dobrynin, I can't prove that he distorted what he heard
                    or was told, because we don't have access to that sort of information in Moscow.
                    But I do know, on the basis of my many conversations with Gromyko, that he
                    didn't understand some of the finer points involved in the SALT II negotiations,
                    primarily because Dobrynin himself didn't understand.</p>
                <p>Now Dobrynin, as you know, never had any note-taker with him. He always liked to
                    be one-on-one with the American Secretary of State and with whomever else he was
                    dealing. Now, that is a big mistake on our part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. And it's an art to remembering what is said and
                        jotting it down and getting off an accurate cable. It takes years of
                        practice, which he had, of course, but also, still, there is an art to
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Absolutely. I told Bill Rogers when he came in as Secretary of State—I was
                    then Deputy Assistant Secretary handling eastern Europe—that he should never
                    meet one on one with the Soviet ambassador. He should always have with him
                    somebody who understands what is going on inside the Soviet Union. He said, “You
                    have given me good advice. Of course, you will always be here when I meet with
                    Dobrynin.”</p>
                <p>Then I went off to Prague as Ambassador. I came back on consultation six months
                    later, and Mr. Rogers was behaving exactly the same way as his predecessors
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some little time ago, I said I wasn't going to take much
                        more of your time. Let me ask you two points, just quick views, that which
                        gave you the greatest sense of accomplishment and your greatest
                        disappointment in your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I think the greatest sense of accomplishment I had was in Belgrade, where I
                    was very lucky. My first official act as ambassador, one week after I arrived,
                    was to take Tito around the United States on his first state visit. I lived
                    check by Jove with Tito around the country, so I got to know him very well. The
                    result was a very close, personal relationship with Tito when I returned to
                    Belgrade.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Let me tell you a funny story about that. When we were traveling between Houston
                    and Long Beach, California, in a White House aircraft, Tito invited me up to his
                    quarters to have a conversation. He spoke Russian, primarily because he was a
                    sergeant in the Austria-Hungarian Imperial Army in World War I and was captured
                    and was a POW in Moscow. He learned the language, became a communist, and
                    married a communist gal. But in any case, he spoke fluent Russian, so we had a
                    long conversation in Russian. At the end of it, he said to me, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    you speak very good Russian.” But he said, “Now you are the ambassador in my
                    country, and you better learn our language.”</p>
                <p>I went back to Belgrade. Shortly after I returned, I had a long meeting with the
                    foreign minister, who was then Tepovac, who was on the trip, of course, with
                    Tito, but who was not privy to this conversation I had had with him. He said to
                    me, “You know, Mr. Ambassador, you've got a leg up on every ambassador in town.
                    You know the two great world languages very well, English and Russian. There is
                    no need for you to know Serbo-Croatian.” Then I told him the story. He cleared
                    his throat and said, “Maybe you better learn Serbo-Croatian and follow the
                    president's advice.” This gave me a clear understanding as to the tremendous
                    power that this guy had.</p>
                <p>In any case, while I was there—I don't say it was primarily because of my
                    efforts—we did develop a very good, close, personal relationship with Tito and
                    with the Yugoslav people.</p>
                <p>My greatest disappointment, I guess, probably was in Moscow. At first I thought I
                    had a really good chance of getting our relationship back on what I call a safe
                    and reliable keel; this is, by addressing the Soviet leadership through the
                    American Embassy, through the American ambassador, taking advantage of the very
                    highly-trained professional staff that we had in Moscow in those days rather
                    than relying exclusively on Dobrynin and his channel. Toward the end of my stay,
                    as you indicated earlier, Vance started dealing almost exclusively with Dobrynin
                    primarily on SALT II issues. At least I managed to have Vance double-track
                    everything through Moscow in order to avoid misunderstandings. I made it clear
                    to him that it was obvious from my conversations with Gromyko that Dobrynin was
                    not reporting accurately. Whether he was deliberately distorting what he had
                    been told, I don't know, but he was not getting the message across. So at least
                    we made that achievement. But I did not succeed in persuading Washington to deal
                    primarily through the American ambassador. That, I think, is my greatest
                    disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am not going to take any more of your time, but I
                        certainly appreciate having the chance for this conversation. Unless there

                        forgot to ask . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: No, I think you've covered the scene very well, indeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I would like to strike one final personal note. As you know, I was very
                    outspoken, very vocal, after I retired about nine years ago, on the whole
                    question of career appointments versus political appointments as ambassadors. I
                    was a consultant at that time to the State Department and to the White House.
                    The word clearly went out from Mr. Reagan that they—the State Department and the
                    White House—should stop consulting me on all issues, primarily because of the
                    points that I was making about political appointees.</p>
                <p>What I was trying to get across was that we do not necessarily have to rely only
                    on the career service, but we must, if we insist on appointing ambassadors to
                    important posts from the outside, we must make sure that they are qualified.
                    That was the only point I was making.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I thought that when George Bush came into office, we would see an end to
                    that sort of thing, because George Bush, in a very real sense, is a professional
                    himself. He knows the value of having a good professional ambassador. But I was
                    told in Washington just recently that the record so far on ambassadorial
                    appointments is thirty-five political appointees versus twelve career. Now I
                    think that is depressing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The overall ratio, did anybody tell you? Was it sixty
                        professional, forty nonprofessional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's about what it was under Reagan. Is it going even
                        further under Bush?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Apparently so. As I understand the situation from colleagues in the State
                    Department, the appointment process is in Baker's hands. Baker managed the
                    campaign. I guess he is under great pressure from all kinds of people who
                    handled bits and pieces of the campaign to reward them with jobs. But again, we
                    are sending—let me make my point perfectly clear. It is not that we draw people
                    from the outside that I object to. I recognize the imperatives of the American
                    political process; you've got to do that. But just make sure that they are
                    highly qualified people. In some cases, they are turkeys. They are not even
                    distinguished in their own line of work.</p>
                <p>I just made a trip recently to New Zealand. I spent two and a half years out
                    there—the South and Southwest Pacific—as a PT boat Skipper. I never saw Hawaii.
                    I never saw Australia. I never saw New Zealand. But I can tell you all about
                    those bleak little islands out there. Finally, my wife and I decided to visit
                    Australia and New Zealand. The Australian High Commissioner in New Zealand is an
                    old friend of ours. I asked him who the American ambassador was. He said, “She's
                    not here yet. But I understand she's an obscure fund-raiser from the state of
                    Washington.” It is just awfully depressing to realize that we were appointing
                    that sort of person to an important Embassy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's an apt comment to depart. We are five months
                        into the administration. You know, better than I perhaps, the historical
                        meaning over the past two or three decades. The ratio has been about
                        two-thirds professional to one-third amateur among the ambassadors. Under
                        Reagan, it got to be about sixty-forty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: I am a student of this sort of thing, as you must know from my many
                    speeches on the subject and appearances on television. The worst was under
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I've read that somewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Then the best it has been was under Carter. Toward the end of the Carter
                    Administration, it got up to about 75%. Then it deteriorated under Reagan. And
                    now, I think, frankly, it is worse so far under Mr. Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this affect your advice to a young or reasonably
                        young person seeking a career as an FSO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TOON: Yes, and I have given this advice on a number of college campuses in recent
                    years. I have told them that I had a singularly interesting and, I think, useful
                    career as a professional diplomat. But I could not, on the basis of what has
                    happened in recent years, conscientiously recommend the Foreign Service as a
                    career for a young, bright person if, in fact, that person felt that for a
                    successful career, he had to become an ambassador. The reason is that the
                    chances of becoming an ambassador these days are, I would say, one in a
                    thousand. The chances of having four embassies, such as I had, are absolutely
                    nil. So I don't think it is the same sort of career that perhaps you and I knew
                    when we came into the Service.</p>
                <p>I never felt, for example, that I would be blocked by this great flood of
                    political appointees from aspiring to the top jobs in the diplomatic service. I
                    never thought also that Washington would rely on the advice of totally
                    uninitiated people rather than the advice of professionals. But that is the case
                    today, and it has been the case in recent years. For that reason, I do not
                    recommend a diplomatic career for a bright, young college graduate.</p>
                <p>I do recommend that all take the Foreign Service examination, primarily because
                    if you pass it, you have in your hands a great credential. It is a tough
                    examination, as you know, and it is recognized as tough by the corporate
                    community. If you want a job with multi-national corporations, and most of them
                    are turning that way now, then you should take and pass the Foreign Service
                    examination. That will give you a credential that will be respected by a
                    prospective employer.</p>

                <p>I am a trustee at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and have been for a
                    number of years now on the Board of Trustees of Tufts University. It is
                    depressing to me, and I think it also reinforces what I have been saying about
                    the lack of attractiveness of the Foreign Service as a career, that only three
                    out of the entire graduating class of the Fletcher School in the past year have
                    opted for public service.</p>
