                <p>SCOTT COHEN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 21, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scott, I wonder if you'd give me a little of your
                        background, where you were educated and your military experience before we
                        get you into government work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I was born in Boston, and the first significant thing in my life was when
                    Tom Yawkey bought the Red Sox in 1953, and my family's allegiance moved from the
                    Braves to the Red Sox. I've suffered ever since.</p>
                <p>I went to Boston University, graduated in history and served in World War II in
                    India and China as an Army news correspondent. At the end of the war, I returned
                    from Kunming to Calcutta and wrote the history of the Calcutta base section for
                    the India-Burma theater history.</p>
                <p>Following the war, I returned to college for a year to complete my degree, then
                    went to Harvard for a semester in the School of Government studying Far Eastern
                    history. One of my professors, Bruce Harper, a former Foreign Service officer,
                    was outstanding. I took five weeks off in the summer of '49 to go on active duty
                    at the Boston Army Base to write what they called The Unofficial History of the
                    New England Military District. Then I went to work for FBIS in September
                    '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FBIS is what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Foreign Broadcast Information Service. In September '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the basic function of FBIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>COHEN: The Foreign Broadcast Information Service is a radio and press monitoring
                    arm of the United States Government which operates in several foreign countries
                    and has a couple of monitoring bases in the United States as well. It provides a
                    daily report to the intelligence community and also an unclassified report which
                    is made available to the press and the general public. The only reason for
                    classification of any of this is that they intercept the transmissions of the
                    international news agencies: API, Reuter's, Xinhua, and so forth. Those have to
                    be classified for copyright reasons, not for security reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the FBIS in 1949. I would like to focus on
                        your experience. You went to Saigon in 1951.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes, I arrived there the first week of February 1951 to complete a
                    negotiation with the French High Command and the Vietnamese Army for a joint
                    radio monitoring operation out of a suburb of Saigon. That was quickly
                    concluded, and I think we were reporting as soon as the second or third week,
                    maybe the third week in February 1951, by radio teletype to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Saigon? This was '51. What was
                        the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Saigon then was a beautiful French provincial town with an educated middle
                    class, a very attractive people, who, to a large extent, were fascinated with
                    the French way of life and adopted much of French style and culture. Next to
                    Saigon was the city of Cholon with half a million Chinese who maintained their
                    own culture and seemed less interested in French culture.</p>
                <p>The political situation, it was the time of the Bao Dai experiment when Bao Dai
                    was named emperor of Vietnam, largely due to American pressure on the French to
                    establish some Vietnamese government that had a semblance of credibility and
                    integrity. But, in fact, he was a puppet of the French. And in his ministries,
                    there were installed Vietnamese at the top level and beside them French
                    advisors, who, to a great extent, ran those ministries. They had more
                    experience, but that's not why they were running them. They were running them
                    because France was in charge. It was called the Union of Associated States of
                    Indochina, which included Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. There was clear French
                    control, and the French were also training, under Bao Dai, a Vietnamese army of
                    indifferent quality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you had to deal with any problems, did you go to the
                        Vietnamese or to the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>COHEN: I had counterparts in the monitoring business, a French commandant whose
                    name was Besnier, a very impressive man in the French High Command—I guess
                    that's the rank of major in our army—and a Vietnamese colonel representing the
                    Vietnamese Army. I had the smoothest of relations with them. And when there were
                    difficulties, I could meet with them and resolve the difficulties very easily.
                    We had a similar goal: to find out what the dissident radio stations were
                    broadcasting. And there were many. It wasn't just the Viet Minh at that time.
                    Even the Cao Dai had a radio station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cao Dai being sort of a religious sect, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: A religious and political sect. I knew their Pope who had a spiritual bent
                    and an army of ten thousand, a very interesting man, and some day I'd like to
                    tell the story of the Cao Dai. I got to know him on a very personal basis and
                    went to Tay-Ninh, his capital, forty miles from Saigon, many times. But there
                    was also a Buddhist sect with a radio station. I suppose, at any given time,
                    there were about ten to fifteen different authorities broadcasting in Vietnam,
                    and what they were saying was important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we only listening there to monitor them, or were we
                        using it also as a monitoring station for other areas, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: We were interested only in Indochina. There was a larger monitoring
                    station in the Pacific which listened to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. You came back to Washington in 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I arrived back in January 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to go into what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: If it's of any interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Not so significant. I was made editor of three regional daily reports of
                    radio broadcasting. I think it was Near East and North Africa, Latin America,
                    and Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is also a prelude to what you were doing later, but
                        the point being that you had really extensive experience from the military
                        and from your FBIS work in foreign affairs before you got...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: And the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And particularly in the Far East. So you were with the
                        Central Intelligence Agency for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Which is the father of FBIS, although FBIS was a very overt service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think it still is. Is it still with the CIA? But,
                        anyway, you ended up in Chicago. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes, ultimately. I went to Chicago in January 1957 and served there
                    through December 1963, at which time I left to work as assistant research
                    director in Charles H. Percy's first political campaign. He was running for
                    governor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you to Percy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I was attracted to Percy when I arrived in 1957 in Chicago. He was the
                    president of Bell &amp; Howell Corporation, very interested both in the
                    Republican Party and aligning himself with the moderate wing in the party, and
                    also in the local political scene in Chicago. He also was very interested in
                    foreign affairs and particularly in South Asia and was traveling to India on his
                    vacations almost every year, once spending, I think, three weeks in India.</p>
                <p>I thought that he was a voice of reform and moderation in Illinois politics. It
                    had long been felt that someday he would run for public office. He had already
                    been identified by President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower as a comer who should be
                    encouraged. And, in fact, he did encourage Percy to run for public office. He
                    named Percy head of his National Republican Party study on future policies that
                    the party should adopt, and they came up with much more progressive social
                    policies than the Republican Party had ever stood for before. And he chose
                    Percy—although Percy had not been formally in politics—to be chairman of the
                    Republican National Convention in 1960. There is a letter from Eisenhower to
                    Percy encouraging him about that time to run for public office in which
                    Eisenhower said, “And if you should ultimately attain the highest office in the
                    land, no one would be more pleased than I,” which is quite an endorsement from a
                    sitting president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. How did you come in contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I just admired him from afar. I was a civil servant. I wasn't
                    engaged in politics in any way. My assignment there was one of contact in the
                    name of the director of the CIA with business, banking, academic institutions,
                    obtaining analyses of foreign developments, industrial, scientific, political,
                    and so forth. But through a friend at the University of Chicago, I met on a
                    social basis the then chairman of the political science department, Morton
                    Grodzins, a very interesting person. He was a liberal Democrat, but he very much
                    admired Charles Percy.</p>
                <p>Percy was on the board of the university, and Grodzins felt that Percy had done
                    more for the university than any board member in memory in raising interest in
                    the physical and biological sciences there and in obtaining the funding to
                    expand the university's efforts in those fields particularly. But he said Percy
                    was a Renaissance man. He was interested in everything. And he encouraged me—if
                    Percy ever ran for public office—to join Percy. And when Percy did announce in
                    '63 that he was going to run for governor in '64, Grodzins put me in touch with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This first contact, what were you doing with Percy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: With Percy, in that first campaign for governor, I was assistant research
                    director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I was doing research on issues. I also wrote many, many articles for
                    Percy's approval and signature. In fact, because Percy was not so well known
                    downstate, before he would make his first appearance in a community, I would
                    write an article which would appear in the most popular paper in that community,
                    establishing his points, his policies, his platform. And I also was researching
                    the issues in each community so that he was familiar with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Percy operate? What was his method of working on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: He worked from 6:00 a.m. until midnight every day. He had tremendous
                    energy. He was born in 1919, and this was 1964. So he was still young. He was a
                    very lively, energetic, dynamic person. In fact, his dynamism was so obvious to
                    everyone who heard him or saw him or saw him in the media that we used for the
                    original primary campaign the slogan, “Chuck Percy: The Dynamic Conservative.”
                    After we won the primary, which was a hard primary, but we won by a margin of
                    two to one over the state treasurer, William Scott, we changed that to, “The
                    Dynamic Republican,” for the general campaign.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>He's a very serious man. In order to prepare himself to run for public office,
                    for example, he employed a young Ph.D. candidate, who was already teaching in
                    the Political Science Department of the University of Chicago, Robert A.
                    Goldwin, who was extremely knowledgeable about the Constitution and the framers
                    and the early days, to educate him on the political process. And they studied
                    the Federalist Papers and similar publications over a period of years starting,
                    I think, in 1959 and only stopping when the campaign schedule got heavy in '64.
                    Every Saturday, Goldwin went to his house in the suburbs and spent about three
                    hours with him discussing the readings which Percy had done during the week and
                    assigning a paper to Percy to write every week. It's rather remarkable for a CEO
                    to go into it in such depth. But Percy thought he should be better grounded than
                    he was in politics, although he was a graduate of the University of Chicago
                    himself in economics.</p>
                <p>So Percy was a serious person. He also was a person who always, and to this day,
                    seeks the opinions of others. And what was remarkable to members of the staff
                    was that he wanted to be criticized frankly when any one of us thought he did
                    something poorly, said something poorly, took a position with which we
                    disagreed, and so forth. And one could argue these points, sometimes be
                    persuasive, sometimes just get a fair hearing. But he took the criticism
                    seriously. He never wanted a “yes” man. At one point, I had some differences
                    with him over a two-year period, during which he called me “Dr. No.” But he kept
                    me on, even raised my pay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We want to move to the Senate, but how did the campaign
                        for governor go, and your role in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, in the primary we had the significant opponent, William Scott, who
                    was supported by the Chicago Tribune and a large element of the Republican
                    Party, which was quite conservative. But I think because Percy was such an
                    attractive personality—and there were some moderates around—he managed to win
                    something like 63 percent of the vote in the primary. And we went into the
                    general election against a very strong and popular governor, Otto Kerner, whom
                    we respected till near the end of the campaign. He was a responsible person.</p>
                <p>The biggest complaint one could make against Kerner was that he was in Mayor
                    Daley's hip pocket, and I think he found that politically necessary. But he was
                    a responsible governor, except that in September, someone came to us with
                    information which led to a charge of corruption in his administration, and his
                    campaign manager, who had been the state director of finance earlier in the
                    Kerner administration, had to resign and ultimately was prosecuted and so
                    forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Well, Kerner defeated us by, I think, 80,000 votes out of 4 million cast. And
                    ultimately Kerner went to prison in his next term for awarding preferred racing
                    dates to a racetrack in exchange for stock that was worth a dollar a share and
                    was sold to him for ten cents a share. This was very hard for us to believe,
                    because Kerner had such a reputation for integrity. And the irony of all this
                    was that Kerner, in prison, contracted cancer, was in very bad health, and
                    Percy, then a sitting senator, arranged with, I guess it was the Nixon-Ford
                    administration, to have him released from prison so he could die a free man. And
                    he died in, maybe, six or eight months. It was very sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this period before Percy ran successfully for the
                        Senate, which was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: '66.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was about a two-year period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I've been talking about 1964, the year he ran against Kerner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in that interim time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: The morning after the 1964 election—we lost— Percy had a press conference
                    in the campaign headquarters at the Sherman Hotel in Chicago. And then he walked
                    over to me and said, “I would like you to stay on with me in a personal
                    capacity, and we'll talk about it.” And then we were closeted for several hours,
                    Percy and his family, who left after about a half hour, and the top four or five
                    advisors, to decide what we were going to do next and how we were going to close
                    out the campaign, which, you know, when you mount a campaign, you're putting
                    together a multi-million dollar organization for one year. And how do you
                    dismantle it? Whom do you keep for future operations, if any? What are your
                    future plans that you can foresee at that moment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's much more to it than one realizes, isn't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Oh, yes. And so it was decided at that meeting that I would be retained.
                    And we decided that we would try to do things to advance certain proposals we
                    had made in the campaign such as combating illiteracy, which was still a major
                    problem in Illinois, functional illiteracy—unable to read, write, and compute at
                    above a sixth-grade level. And we wanted to do something about economic
                    development for southern Illinois, which was in bad straits, and we were
                    concerned with urban problems in Chicago, because the Daley administration,
                    which was very efficient in many respects, badly neglected the minority
                    populations.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So I did a lot of research, interviewed dozens of people, got ideas, and came up
                    with a program which we started to implement in January '65. It was established
                    with the name the New Illinois Committee. We opened an office, and we started
                    projects. And it was really very well received. Of course, it also had the
                    benefit, which we didn't overlook, of keeping Percy in the public eye, doing
                    constructive things, looking toward running for governor again four years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we move to '66.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Also, in '65, I was writing his speeches, some on foreign affairs, some on
                    civil liberties and so forth, and doing his press work. We had no intention of
                    running in '66. The three-term incumbent, Paul Douglas, we felt, was still very
                    popular. Percy had personal respect for him. Percy saw himself more as a
                    governor than a senator, as a manager. He had been a manager all his adult
                    life.</p>
                <p>The Republican Party was insisting that he run. The moderates wanted a moderate
                    like Percy to run. The conservatives wanted Percy to run, because even if he
                    lost, well, then they'd be finished with him. They wouldn't have to listen to
                    him anymore. But they were willing to support him against a man they considered
                    a socialist, Paul Douglas. Everett Dirksen, who was the Republican senator from
                    Illinois and who had reservations about reform types such as Percy, urged him to
                    run as the only person who had a chance against Douglas. I think Dirksen didn't
                    care if he should lose either, but in the campaign he was very helpful.</p>
                <p>So we thought, well, we'd better do a poll and see if there's any possibility of
                    winning. And we found that although Douglas had been in office for eighteen
                    years, we were only six points behind him. And Percy had higher name
                    recognition, maybe because he had just run. So we did a lot of thinking for a
                    couple of months and then decided to go. And in that '66 campaign, I was the
                    press secretary and the spokesman, and advised Percy on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any foreign policy issues that came up during
                        the campaign? Because Douglas was a very respected senator, considered a
                        pillar of the liberal establishment, I guess, in the Democratic Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Absolutely. In 1966, we made Vietnam a major campaign issue against
                    Douglas. The escalation that President [Lyndon B.] Johnson began in early 1965
                    was really taking hold, and our commitment of troops was mounting in numbers
                    very quickly. From my earlier experience in Vietnam and from watching it very
                    closely in the intervening years, I already had doubts about what we could
                    accomplish in Vietnam, and about the cost, both in blood and treasure, that it
                    would take to accomplish anything. We talked a great deal about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In April '66, we had a full day at, I think it was, O'Hare Inn at O'Hare Airport
                    in Chicago, where we met with Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Bruce
                    Harlow, Mort Halperin, and Bob Osgood and talked Vietnam the whole day, heard
                    their views, encouraged them to argue their disagreements and so forth, taped it
                    so we could go back over it. Percy wanted to bring together people on both sides
                    of the question and in between to make sure that he was hearing the best
                    arguments on what to do. It was a pretty fascinating day for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: These are outspoken people. As we drove downtown in the evening after
                    that, I was surprised to find that Mort Halperin, who, like me, was questioning
                    the war effort, had made a profound impact on Percy's own thinking, although
                    Percy's closest friend in the group was Henry Kissinger, whom he had known for
                    years. Kissinger had served under him on the commission in the '50s to plot the
                    future direction of the Republican Party. I thought going into this meeting that
                    Kissinger's views might prevail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were strongly to support, or where were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I don't like to characterize them exactly, because I don't remember
                    that well. I might, on thinking it over, but I wasn't prepared to talk about
                    that today. So I don't want to misrepresent his views. But I believe he was not
                    opposing the policy. Well, he was not opposing the policy of Johnson.</p>
                <p>And, as I recall, Percy asked him, “Well, how long do you think this will go
                    on?”</p>
                <p>Kissinger thought and finally said, “Maybe seven years, but I think we'll
                    prevail.” Well, it was seven years, approximately, till the Paris agreement.</p>
                <p>But Percy wanted to explore further what we would call the dovish position. And
                    so I put together readings for him for and against the dovish position. I tried
                    always to be fair to him in my input, so it wasn't just my opinion. If he asked
                    me my opinion, I'd tell him my opinion, or I'd write it as one of the opinions
                    for him to consider. But I never shielded him from the people who disagreed with
                    me. And he trusted me because that was always the case to the last day.</p>
                <p>Mort Halperin had gone beyond my position on the dovish side. We thought that
                    there might be political risks in being dovish in 1966, because that view was
                    just starting to take hold of the most liberal Democrats and not even all of
                    them—not Paul Douglas, who was supporting Johnson down the line, saying that we
                    have to stop communism in Vietnam. But it was very risky with our
                    Republicans.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: And the only Republican who had expressed dovish views up to that point
                    was the governor of Oregon, Mark Hatfield, who also was running for the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>Well, in June, I took a brief vacation, maybe four or five days. I went to the
                    University of Missouri to meet with former Army buddies. And when I returned I
                    was told that Duff Reed, the press secretary to Thruston Morton, sitting senator
                    from Kentucky, who was chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee,
                    had come to Chicago at Morton's request to discuss things with Percy, how they
                    could help and so forth. Duff said we should think in terms of a global
                    conference on the Vietnam problem to resolve it. The campaign manager, who was
                    fairly conservative, was interested in it. So I had to take it seriously. So I
                    took it seriously for a couple of days, and I tried to refine it into something
                    that was more credible, less global, and less subject to criticism. And I came
                    up with the idea for an all-Asian peace conference on Vietnam that would include
                    China but not the Soviet Union. Well, the first reaction to this was, “Oh, God.
                    You've got to bring Communist China into it? We'll be killed in the
                    election.”</p>
                <p>Well, I refined it some more but left China in, saying that such a conference
                    would be meaningless without China. China has to agree or the war goes on. You
                    have to include China. But I said we don't have to worry, because the American
                    interest would be supported by most of the other countries of Asia, and so we
                    wouldn't be run over there. So I discussed it with professors and so forth. I
                    think I got back to Brzezinski. I talked to liberal Republican senators and
                    Thruston Morton. And Morton thought, “Gee, this is a pretty good idea.” He said,
                    “This might give the Republican Party something to hang on to if public opinion
                    turns against the war.” But it hadn't yet. So I talked to Mark Hatfield on the
                    phone, and he thought it was a good idea. He said, “I'll support that.” Duff
                    Reed talked to conservative Republicans on the Hill, and some of them thought,
                    “Oh, you know, for a political thing. Since we're never going to do it . . .”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Well, we did go public with that, I think in early July '66. And Douglas, as we
                    expected, denounced it and said, in effect, “It's a patriotic thing to support
                    your president when you have your men in the field. You're going to undercut
                    them.” We got some flak from the right wing, but most of them thought we didn't
                    mean it. They thought it was just a political gambit, so they weren't so angry.
                    But it wasn't. Percy meant it, and he thought he was taking a political risk
                    rather than doing it for political value.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But, suddenly, those known in Chicago as the lakefront liberals started coming in
                    and saying they'd like to help in the campaign. Ab Mikva, the Democratic
                    congressman, was running for re-election, and we found that a lot of the college
                    students who were working for his campaign came over to our campaign, and some
                    said, “Well, we'll work for you during the day”—that was in the summer—”and for
                    him at night or vice versa.” We found a lot of support coming in. So,
                    ultimately, the chance we took on Vietnam helped us, and it was one of the major
                    issues in the campaign, because it was one of the clearest differences between
                    Douglas and Percy. Percy wasn't saying the United States should get out. He was
                    saying we should be working for peace rather than victory, because victory was
                    unattainable without nuclear weapons, and we could not use nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>Then I found in my research at the newspapers that Paul Douglas in, I guess it
                    was late 1952—it was after the Chinese had entered the Korean War—was quoted in
                    a two- paragraph AP [Associated Press] story as saying, “The situation is
                    deteriorating in Korea, and we will have to use nuclear weapons.” We held that
                    information over the summer and early fall, and in October in an appearance on
                    “Face the Nation,” Paul Douglas was asked about that, and he did not deny it. He
                    said, “What I meant was tactical nuclear weapons only against troops, not
                    against civilians. And I thought it was the only way to save the situation, and
                    I would say it again.”</p>
                <p>And they said, “You'd use them in Vietnam?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, it's unnecessary there.” He knew he had made a mistake. And we got
                    a very big liberal vote and defeated Paul Douglas by, I think it was, 420,000

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to the time that you came into the Senate,
                        but let's focus on the foreign relations side. What were you up to, what was
                        your position, and how did things develop? This would have been '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: We went to the Senate in January '67.From the outset, Percy was seen as a
                    comer by the Washington press, and we were really besieged by the press from day
                    one. Also, Congressional Relations at State was after us immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Congressional Relations within the Department of
                        State, which is called the H Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>COHEN: Right. H was after us immediately to get us on board in various policies
                    of the Johnson administration. Percy and I hadn't discussed what I would do. It
                    was assumed I would be press secretary, so I was getting the press. But I was
                    the only one on the staff who knew anything about foreign affairs, so I was
                    getting visitors from State and ACDA, the arms control agency. ACDA came right
                    over with a book of quotations from Republicans in favor of arms control to show
                    us that it was okay to be for arms control and be a Republican, too, and this
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So I guess after about a week or ten days, I went in to Percy and I said, “I'm
                    doing foreign affairs and press, and I really don't have time to do both.
                    They're full-time jobs.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Which would you prefer to do?”</p>
                <p>I said, “foreign affairs.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, what's your reason for that?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, one, it's more important. Two, I've always been interested in it.
                    And, three, I'm sick and tired of rewrite men calling me at two and three in the
                    morning to verify quotations and that sort of thing.” [Laughter] I said, “My
                    family will be happier.”</p>
                <p>So he said, “Okay.” And we had my assistant do press until we hired someone at a
                    more senior level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Percy fit within the Senate at that time? What
                        committees was he on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, you know, when you arrive, you don't have your choice. His first
                    choice had been foreign relations, but he didn't get it. I think, on my
                    recommendation, he pushed very hard then for his second choice, government
                    operations, which I thought was a very useful committee, both in monitoring the
                    bureaucracy, and, two, in making a record. Because there are always things that
                    can be improved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also it's one of his strengths as the executive
                        officer of Bell &amp; Howell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had made a fine reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>COHEN: Yes, that's right. It seemed a perfect one. And they put us on the Space
                    Committee, which he soon tired of, because all they did was authorize
                    appropriations. There was very little policy. He got on the Banking Committee
                    because he had an initiative we developed in the campaign to subsidize the
                    purchase of low-income housing. And in his first month in the Senate—because we
                    had written a piece of legislation during the campaign, we were ready to go—he
                    got all Republican senators to co-sponsor his bill, which ultimately passed the
                    next year and became law. So that was an early legislative victory for him.</p>
                <p>On foreign affairs, we were deep into the Vietnam debate. But, you know,
                    everything keeps coming up, and gradually you comment on everything. He was
                    interested in the hearings in Foreign Relations, before he was a member of the
                    committee, on national commitments, and we had a proposal there requiring an
                    annual report on objectives of the foreign policy from the president, thinking
                    that it might bring more candid responses and so forth. Looking back, maybe it
                    was naive. It was not accepted by Chairman Fulbright, who had other ideas
                    anyway. But Percy testified before the committee.</p>
                <p>Very often he asked if he could come to a hearing. He sat at the end of the
                    table. They let him question and so forth. So he was interested from the start,
                    and I worked very closely with staff members of the committee. Well, at that
                    time the staff was not bipartisan. They were all for Fulbright. [Laughter] They
                    were all Fulbright appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me your impression, first, of how the
                        Department of State worked, we'll say, with a new senator coming in, who was
                        sort of a liberal Republican looking at some opposition to our major
                        commitment? What was your impression of how they operated and the type of
                        pressure that would be...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: In general, they were diplomatic. I'm trying to think who was the first
                    assistant secretary for congressional relations we dealt with. Was it
                    MacArthur?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It could well have been Douglas MacArthur. He was there at
                        one time. I can check that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: And I don't think he was very aggressive, as I recall. The earliest
                    assistant secretary for congressional relations, with whom we had a great
                    give-and-take was Dave Abshire in the [President Richard M.] Nixon
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Referring to notes] It would have been MacArthur
                        probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William Macomber took over from '67 to '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: That's right. And we had a lot of contact with “Butz”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because he was a creature of Congress, too, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Originally, yes. He was very effective. He was a good diplomat, and he was
                    a good politician. We respected him. You could disagree with him in an agreeable
                    fashion on both sides. He was very fine, and I think he had considerable
                    influence because he was trusted. That varied over the years. Some people didn't
                    handle it very well. “Butz” Macomber handled it very well. I think he had been
                    ambassador to Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And Turkey at one time. Back and forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: He knew a great deal about the Middle East. I think, personally, he was a
                    very open-minded person. He had the right personality and style to deal with
                    senators, and he dealt with the staff fairly and honestly. We liked him. But I
                    think very early on we asked if Senator Percy and I could meet directly with the
                    leadership of each of the regional bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. And we went over to State for these meetings, which usually lasted
                    two or three hours. And we'd sit down with the assistant secretary and his
                    deputy assistant secretaries and maybe a couple of office directors, and I think
                    in some cases we asked for specific office directors because we were interested
                    in those areas like South Asia. Percy had this long interest in South Asia. That
                    was very educational for us, not only in clarifying where the administration
                    stood on everything, but also in getting answers to our questions and starting
                    to come to some conclusions about where we might differ.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as a technique, did you find that by going over to
                        the Department of State, talking to the desk officers, the bureau chiefs and
                        all, that this was a more informal, easier- to-deal-with thing than later on
                        having somebody sit before the microphones before the Foreign Relations
                        Committee? I mean, if you wanted to get information, it strikes me that this
                        would not be as loaded politically.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>COHEN: That's right. Well, through the years and even now, we always maintained
                    close relations with the bureaus and numbers of people within each bureau so
                    that we could call them up. They'd drop in or we'd go there and get a more
                    candid view than they could give before the microphones in the hearings. Also,
                    it was educational for us, because these are the people who are dealing only
                    with those subjects, and we had to deal with everything. We needed it, and the
                    senator, early on, went over to the CIA, too, and had similar meetings and
                    established relations for me at a fairly senior level where I could always get
                    information, where I'd always be welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found that even during a period of increasing— oh,
                        I don't know, I'd call it political tension. But, you know, I mean, as the
                        Vietnam War obviously saw more and more interest, this was not the Congress
                        versus the State Department or CIA. I mean, the lines of communications were
                        open?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Oh, absolutely, yes. The most problem we had over the years was never with
                    State or the director of the CIA or the secretary of defense, although sometimes
                    with the secretary of defense on some issues, for example, the ABM deployment.
                    But our big problem was always with the White House staff in each administration
                    starting with Nixon. We didn't have so much contact with White House staff in
                    the last two years of the Johnson administration when we were there, because
                    Percy had a personal relationship with Johnson, and he'd go to Johnson directly.
                    And except for Harry McPherson, we didn't know the White House staff too well.
                    Harry McPherson became a friend and is still a friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Harry McPherson's title in the White House
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I'm not sure what his title was. But he was one of the top three or
                    four in the Johnson White House, and Percy got to know him also because both of
                    them were on the board of the Kennedy Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To concentrate on sort of this relationship business,
                        because I think this is extremely important, when the Nixon administration
                        came on, here all of a sudden you were a Republican senator, you had a
                        president coming on board who was certainly interested in foreign
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: And knowledgeable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And really knowledgeable. Although maybe there's obviously
                        a personality difference, but with Nixon everybody was a personality
                        difference, I think. There seemed to be a real meeting of minds. How did
                        this work as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>COHEN: Well, in politics, as you know, there are different kinds of people. There
                    are consensus makers, and at the other end there are what I consider to be sort
                    of killers—people who want to destroy their opponents, not only because they may
                    be rivals, but because they may interfere with what a person wants to do or
                    disagrees strongly on an issue or a position that's of great concern to the
                    president or to his secretary of state. Secretaries of state, though, in
                    general, as I have seen them over the years, are not as tough as presidents.</p>
                <p>As we went into the Nixon administration, Percy had good connections, although he
                    had supported Nelson Rockefeller against Nixon at the convention. He had known
                    Nixon since the '50s when Nixon served under him on the commission that Percy
                    headed for the Republican Party. And Nixon had come to Illinois in 1964, to
                    Percy's home where we had maybe 1,000 people to speak for Percy. And they were
                    always in touch. They didn't always agree, but they had a nice relationship.</p>
                <p>Percy had been in touch with Kissinger since the '50s when Kissinger was also on
                    the commission, and Percy respected him. As for Bill Rogers, I don't know if
                    Percy knew him before—when he was attorney general in the Eisenhower
                    administration—probably not well. But he recognized Bill Rogers as a man of
                    character and integrity and rightly predicted to me that Kissinger would run
                    over him. But he always was in touch with Bill Rogers and respected him.</p>
                <p>So there were some friends around, old friends. I think the Nixon group had
                    written Percy off as a friend when he supported Nelson Rockefeller. One of them
                    said that Percy would have been a more likely choice for vice president had he
                    not done that. But I don't think that would have happened.</p>
                <p>But I think very early in the Nixon administration, certainly no later than March
                    1969, Nixon announced that he was going to change the ABM plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the anti-ballistic missile plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: To produce and deploy. From the [Robert] McNamara formula in the Johnson
                    administration of putting these missile launchers in the suburbs. [Laughter]
                    Which was not very good politics. I'm not sure it was very good for anything.
                    But Nixon said, “We'll put them in the boondocks. We'll put them in North Dakota
                    and so forth.” And they thought they had solved a political problem, because
                    they felt it was necessary and less offensive this way. Maybe we jumped in too
                    quickly, but we had been studying that issue for a long time, starting during
                    our campaign, and we didn't think that ABM production and deployment made a lot
                    of sense, just as we didn't think that MRV missiles—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MRV means multiple—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>COHEN: Putting multiple warheads on single missiles, which we thought would be a
                    terrible burden to the arms control process. So Percy immediately said, “That's
                    no good. The new plan for the ABM is no good.” And the White House was furious.
                    Our domestic legislative director got a call from John Ehrlichman, who said,
                    “You know, under your bill for low-income housing, we're supposed to name a
                    presidentially appointed board to oversee the program. And after reading in the
                    Post this morning what Senator Percy said about our ABM proposal, we don't think
                    we're going to be able to do that.”</p>
                <p>And she said, “It's in the law.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I don't think we're going to be able to do that,” and hung up on
                    her.</p>
                <p>That was mild compared to the hell we got from within the Nixon White House on
                    other issues, because usually it wasn't said so softly. And we became more and
                    more dovish on the war. It was not winnable and was not essential to our
                    national interest. So we had big problems. And Dave Abshire...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of congressional relations at the State
                        Department during this period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. Before, I think it was, the big vote, final vote, on ABM production
                    and deployment, he came to see us. By that time, Percy was really an expert on
                    the subject, because from his experience in industry, he involved himself in the
                    manufacturing process and how this would be done and whether it was really
                    feasible and what it would cost and so forth. He knew something beyond what the
                    other dovish senators were saying. And we had a Sunday afternoon meeting every
                    week at the home of John Sherman Cooper, the Republican senator from Kentucky,
                    who was one of the most respected people in foreign affairs. Phil Hart, the
                    Democrat from Michigan, was usually present and sometimes we invited someone
                    else, and we discussed where the debate stood, what was needed in further
                    research, what we should say next, who would take what role and so forth.</p>
                <p>Dave Abshire came in to dissuade us from our position. Well, I suppose he was
                    dispatched. It was really too late. Percy was one of the leaders of the fight
                    here. And even if he changed his mind, it was too late to change, and he wasn't
                    going to change his mind. And it was very quickly clear to Percy that he, Percy,
                    knew much more about the ABM than Dave Abshire, who probably hadn't been so
                    focused on it, because he's certainly smart enough. Abshire just failed totally
                    to move us in any way. And, you know, we always liked to think of ourselves as
                    open-minded, but he had nothing to offer we didn't already know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were decisions, really, that were coming not—I mean,
                        on the ABM...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>COHEN: It wasn't from the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was really coming as a political decision, wasn't it?
                        How about from the Department of Defense, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Maybe they felt that because we respected Abshire he could dissuade us.
                    But that didn't succeed. And you know how it ended up. The measure to cut off
                    ABM production and deployment, just leave research and development, was defeated
                    on a 50-50 vote. And the reason it was defeated was that Margaret Chase Smith,
                    Republican of Maine, who was one of the most opposed to ABM production, said, “I
                    don't want research and development either. So I can't vote with the other doves
                    on this.” So ABM production and deployment would have been defeated fifty-one to
                    forty-nine, except that she had this quirk in her head. And everybody pleaded
                    with her. She wouldn't listen. She says, “I'm not voting for research and
                    development.” Terrible mistake.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COHEN: He got on, I think it was, the middle or the third week in February

                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I guess. Oh, no, no. Because the election would be in November '72.
                    Someone had dropped off or been defeated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your role change then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, yes. I had to prepare him for every hearing. I had more work, and I
                    had access then to all the closed meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does this mean, for somebody who doesn't understand

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>COHEN: To meetings that were closed to the public because of the security nature
                    of the information that would be discussed. Under the Sunshine Act, there was a
                    great cutback in the number of closed meetings. And, for example, under
                    Sunshine, all the markups, the actual discussion of legislation line by line and
                    all the decisions that are made in a piece of legislation then became open to
                    the public, which was a good thing. Those things used to be closed, and the
                    public really didn't know where everyone stood unless they chose to make it
                    known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about from the '72 period on up through the
                        early '80s. How did you see the personalities working on the Foreign
                        Relations Committee, first between the senators and then with the
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, by and large, the senators on the committee had a very cordial
                    relationship one to the other. They were always polite. Occasionally there would
                    be a flash of anger over something, but not often. There's a great desire in the
                    Senate to be civilized and understanding of why members take different points of
                    view, because they will be influenced by the interests of their constituency,
                    the opinion of their constituency, the nature of their constituency, and their
                    position in the party, their positions vis-�-vis other leaders within the party,
                    their position toward the president if he happens to be of their party or of the
                    president if he happens not to be of their party. All these things come into
                    decisions on issues. It's not as simple as just deciding what you think would be
                    the best course. It's the political process. And so they tend to be
                    understanding of people who disagree with them, so long as the people are not
                    disagreeable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chairman during most of this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, until he was defeated in, I guess it was 1974, it was Bill
                    Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas. Then it was John Sparkman for a couple of
                    years, or four years maybe, a Democrat of Alabama. Then Frank Church, Democrat
                    of Idaho, until he was defeated in November 1980, at which time the Republicans
                    obtained a majority in the Senate for the first time since the first Eisenhower
                    administration, I believe, and Percy, as the senior surviving Republican, since
                    Jack [Jacob] Javits had just been defeated, became chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that being on the Senate Foreign Relations
                        Committee is a good way to get yourself defeated, isn't it? I mean, in a way
                        they stick their head up on issues that leave them vulnerable.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>COHEN: Oh, sure. Because they have to stand up and be counted on everything in
                    foreign affairs. Despite what we generally think in Washington, most of the
                    country, most of the people of the country, are not primarily interested in
                    foreign affairs. There are particular groups who have particular interests, and
                    so you hear of the lobbies—the peace lobby, the Jewish lobby, the Greek lobby,
                    and so forth. And these people who care more about their one issue than anything
                    else will likely vote on how a senator stands on his or her issue. You can't
                    ignore them and survive in many states. Some states you can. So one has to at
                    least be a good listener.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William Fulbright from Arkansas was a major figure for
                        many years, and you saw him towards the end of his career. How did you, as a
                        staff member, see him, how he operated and his effectiveness at this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: He really was a dominant force on the committee. That was a time when
                    committee chairmen were more powerful than they have been in subsequent years.
                    For example, there was one staff for the committee—Fulbright's staff. Later they
                    voted to allow a majority and a minority staff. But Fulbright controlled all the
                    resources, financial and human, of the committee. In effect, Fulbright was the
                    committee. Sometimes he lost something, but not often.</p>
                <p>And he had a bully pulpit for his views, which were sometimes unique. He may have
                    been the first very prominent senator in the '60s to denounce American
                    involvement in the Vietnam War. He felt that President Johnson, who had been one
                    of his closest personal friends and political allies from a neighboring state
                    and whom he had known since Johnson arrived in Washington, had deceived him
                    about the alleged North Vietnamese attack in the Gulf of Tonkin. Fulbright had
                    been the manager of the Tonkin Gulf resolution doing the bidding of President
                    Johnson. Then later he found out that there were serious questions about the
                    legitimacy of the administration position and its interpretation of the attack
                    and so forth. And he was very turned off, and he became such an outspoken
                    opponent of US involvement in Vietnam that it ended up with President Johnson
                    not talking to him. He was always ahead of the curve on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Also, he was the first person to question the unquestioning support for Israel in
                    the Middle East. He thought there were questions that should have been raised,
                    and that if we raised them, we could still have a good and supportive
                    arrangement with Israel but would have better served our national interest in
                    having a relationship also with the Arab world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Percy deal with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I should say that except for maybe Hubert Humphrey, who had returned
                    to the Senate, Fulbright wasn't listening to anyone. He was singing his own
                    tune. And at the beginning of every hearing he might speak for half an hour on
                    what his conclusions were before the hearing. [Laughter] But he was fascinating.
                    He was brilliant, intelligent, creative, and eloquent. It was an education to
                    listen to him, whether one agreed or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any change during this period, say, really
                        during the '70s, between how the State Department and both of the
                        Congressional Relations, the H Bureau, but the other bureaus related both
                        with the Foreign Relations Committee and the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, at the beginning, Douglas MacArthur was the head of Congressional
                    Relations when we arrived. We had less relationship with him than with his
                    successors, partly, probably, because he may not have considered us very
                    significant, being new and not on the committee and so forth. I have the
                    feeling, though, from what I heard, that he wasn't on the Hill a great deal;
                    whereas some subsequent ones like Macomber and Abshire were.</p>
                <p>One of the men I have most respected in politics is Linwood Holton, who was a
                    Republican—I think the first Republican governor of Virginia since
                    Reconstruction. I think he was elected in 1970. And he was a courageous and
                    progressive governor who's still doing important things for the state, a
                    wonderful human being. But he became assistant secretary for congressional
                    relations. I think it was after he left office, which would have been probably
                    in the Ford administration. And, one, he didn't know a great deal about foreign
                    affairs. Two, because he was a little unsure of positions, he didn't testify
                    very effectively. And, three, he didn't feel comfortable at the State Department
                    where he felt that the career people didn't accept him, because they knew more
                    about the substance, and he was trying to carry water for the president.
                    [Laughter] And he also had the burden that the secretary, who was Henry
                    Kissinger, was so much more articulate and persuasive on these issues than he
                    could be, that he wasn't taken too seriously.</p>
                <p>So it was sort of a flop—I would say the only flop of his career. He's a great
                    person. He was a bad choice. They looked for a political position, and they
                    didn't find the right one for him, although he might have served very well
                    somewhere else. So that wasn't too successful. He didn't come to the Hill more
                    than he had to, either, because he didn't feel comfortable. He didn't feel
                    comfortable with some of the policies, too. You ought to interview him
                    sometime.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think of others. Maybe you could refresh my mind. Do you have a
                    listing of them?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just looking quickly through this list. Three was
                        Robert McCloskey and Douglas Bennet and Atwood.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. That's through the [President Jimmy] Carter administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, Bob McCloskey knew everything. He had a broad experience, ambassador
                    in several countries, very bright. He tended to be more combative than most.
                    He's a more prickly guy. He's now working for Catholic Relief Services, and I
                    see him occasionally. I once had a little confrontation with him at a luncheon
                    meeting of a group of lobbyists. He was condemning Congress for getting in the
                    way of their foreign policy, and so I took him on a little. But I do have a lot
                    of respect for him.</p>
                <p>Doug Bennet, a very capable fellow, now heads National Public Radio. I think he
                    worked more with Democrats than Republicans, though. Brian Atwood, first-class
                    fellow. He's heading the Democratic Party International Affairs Institute now,
                    and he's a very solid, sound person, but maybe not as outgoing as you need for
                    that job. But he and Bennet were both respected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've often heard it said in some of these interviews by
                        people who are not in the Foreign Service that the Foreign Service does not
                        really understand or appreciate the role of Congress, and they don't do
                        their homework enough to explain policies or to give people in Congress a
                        hook on which to sell it at home. In other words, they don't work too
                        effectively with this. I wonder if you could talk a little about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I think that's true and maybe state congressional relations people
                    who deal with Congress have a leg up if they have already served on
                    congressional staff such as Macomber, Bennet, and Atwood, because they
                    understand the pressures that members come under, and they're more likely to be
                    understanding and, because they're more understanding, to have a better
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about sort of below them, say, the office directors
                        are often called up, the people who are the head of African affairs or
                        something. Usually you have a professional Foreign Service officer. In your
                        impression of the period of time we're talking about, how did they work, in
                        testimony but also in other contacts with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>COHEN: The testimony is not the important part of it. The important part of it is
                    the one-on-one and closed meetings where they meet with the whole committee or
                    with the whole subcommittee membership. Because relationships aren't built,
                    really, at the hearings, the open hearings, because everybody's on stage. And
                    the people from State aren't necessarily speaking for their own view, certainly
                    not completely. In the one-on-one, they're more likely to discuss options or
                    other considerations that they wouldn't mention publicly or intelligence
                    information that they can't give publicly and so forth.</p>
                <p>There's an advantage, you know, with Congress having access to the CIA that you
                    can check out things you hear from one or the other, and sometimes you find that
                    one has an ax to grind. Sometimes before the [President Ronald] Reagan
                    administration, I would say, we would get more candid information from the
                    agency. It got more politicized under [William] Casey, the director under
                    Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Foreign Service, your contacts and other
                        members of the staff contacts with them? Did you have the feeling that they
                        were responsive or appreciative of the role of Congress, or was there a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes, there's often a problem. Those who worked in congressional relations
                    tended to be briefed or prepared better to deal with the Hill, because they got
                    more input about what had been happening and what was happening when they
                    arrived. Others in the Department, when convinced of a particular view on a
                    particular issue, in talking to a senator or a staff aide on the Hill, might
                    betray their personal feelings that the persons on the Hill were less than
                    patriotic or deficient in understanding of foreign affairs and that they really
                    should change their position, “because I've just presented the truth”. Quite a
                    bit of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, not an awful lot of diplomacy was being
                        displayed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: They would say that in a diplomatic way, but the message was clear.In
                    regard to State Department congressional relations, I'd like to put in a plug
                    for one person who worked in H in the eighteen years I served on the Hill, who
                    stood head and shoulders, in my opinion, above all others lobbying for the State
                    Department. And that was Kempton Jenkins, who—I'm not sure exactly of the years,
                    but I suspect he was in H from something like '71 to '74, something like that,
                    or '72 to '75. He worked the Hill in greater depth than anyone else I ever
                    saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>COHEN: Constant contact. There were weeks when there were important issues before
                    us, before the committee, when he would call me every day. He would share
                    information. If he heard that some new point had been made in a press conference
                    that day, he might call. He would call particularly if it was a point against
                    the State Department position, and he would try to put it into context before I
                    heard about it directly. He was on the ball. He was always informed, and he was
                    articulate and effective. He developed a lot of trust on the Hill. And he had
                    what others sometimes lacked, and that was self- confidence. Because some people
                    assigned to congressional relations may not be well chosen, and they're not
                    lawyers for the prosecution, so to speak. They're not the kind of advocate that
                    will be effective, because members of Congress and their staffs tend to be
                    rather direct and will attack a position out of hand and so forth. They would
                    become flustered and not handle things very well. Kempton Jenkins could mix it
                    up in an amiable way.</p>

                        State, CIA, and Defense, and then where Percy, when you were working for
                        Percy, would be open to suggestion? Would you be open to suggestion? Can you
                        think of, say, an example of how you would deal with him and these other
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: When the executive branch officials came?</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>COHEN: We found there was more open-mindedness before final decisions were made
                    by interagency committees at the NSC level. And if we could be heard before the
                    final decisions were made, there was a chance that what we say would be
                    considered or factored in. Also, in discussing it ahead of the decision, we
                    found out what the political hang-ups were within the administration and within
                    different agencies and so forth. And so we would have more understanding of why
                    they were taking their points of view. But very often, while the interagency
                    process was going on, they would try to hide it from members of Congress, and we
                    would only hear when the public announcement was made. Or the night before the
                    members would be called at their home and said, “We're going to do this
                    tomorrow. We hope you'll support us.” Really after the fact. So the wise
                    secretary of state, when it is a real hairy issue politically, will inform the
                    key members of the committee and the leadership of the Senate and House as
                    things go along. He might try to persuade them of his view within the
                    interagency process and get some support for it, too, rather than hide it and
                    spring it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume there would be, if nothing else, natural

                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We went through probably the most difficult time with our
                        relations with the subcontinent, particularly India, at the height of this
                        time when Kissinger was tilting towards Pakistan, in his own words. You had
                        Senator Percy taking a particular interest in this area. As sort of a case
                        study, what were the reactions and feelings on this, which is something
                        which is still remembered, I mean, in a way of almost—I won't say a black
                        mark against Kissinger, but is remembered by some of them that dealt with
                        the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Percy was never close to the Pakistani position, but in nuclear matters he
                    would be critical of India, too. He tended to give a little more primacy to
                    India than to Pakistan when successive administrations gave primacy to Pakistan
                    for various reasons, some very good. Basically, what he was interested in was a
                    policy which would encourage more harmony between India and Pakistan and a
                    resolution of the problems between them and more openness between them, more
                    meetings between them, and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I remember one phone call we made to Hal Saunders when he was at the NSC handling
                    South Asia, and the position he was expressing, and strongly—you know, he's
                    eloquent, too—was so tilted toward Pakistan that Senator Percy just shook his
                    head. It was clear that we weren't going to get anywhere pursuing that within
                    the administration. Of course, that was Kissinger's position, too. They had
                    reasons to like Pakistan. Pakistan was putting them in touch with China. Then,
                    of course, much later Pakistan was taking the Afghan refugees. There was always
                    some reason. But Percy felt, and I felt, that the leadership of Pakistan in most
                    of those years was very cruel to the people and not to be admired because they
                    did us favors or had mutual interests in certain areas. And we felt all along
                    that they were going ahead with the nuclear development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Senator Percy have any influence, or was just
                        Kissinger running the show?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I don't think he influenced Kissinger on that. He had, and still has, some
                    influence in India and Pakistan. He was out there ten days ago, a month before
                    that, and so forth. He's always had access to the highest circles, and continues
                    to. Of Pakistani leaders, the one he's been closest to is Benazir Bhutto, whose
                    case he plead with previous governments and helped her go back in good
                    health.</p>
                <p>Early on, I guess it was around 1970, when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of East Pakistan
                    was jailed, I think it's generally agreed that Percy, more than anyone else,
                    influenced the government to release him. And then Percy was supportive of the
                    establishment of Bangladesh. And when finally he went there some years later,
                    there was sort of a public celebration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk a bit about the two lobbies.
                        One was very evident, and that's obviously the Jewish lobby on Israel. And
                        the other one, though, came up—I know, because I served in Greece about the
                        time—the Greek lobby, which sort of surprised everybody. But I wonder if you
                        could talk about the influence. Here is a senator and his staff and all
                        dealing with the—I'm not even sure if you can really call it the Jewish
                        lobby. It's really the Friends of Israel or whatever you want to call
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: They're called the pro-Israel lobby, because it goes beyond the Jewish
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have the impression that until very recent times this was
                        almost an absolute instrument of the Israeli government. But what was your
                        impression in dealing with this, and how effective was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I first had contact with the pro-Israel lobby and with the
                    American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), when Cy Kenan was the head of
                    it. He was the founder of it. And I guess that was when we came to the Congress
                    in the late '60s. He had a different style. He tried to make friends for Israel
                    and to persuade people to be supportive of Israel. And he talked to everyone
                    across the board from liberal Democrat to right-wing Republican. He didn't try
                    to overpower them by telling them how many Jewish constituents they had. He
                    assumed they knew. He didn't put pressure on. He tried it by persuasion, and I
                    think he was pretty respected.</p>
                <p>Of course, it was a period in which Israel's image was perhaps more positive than
                    it is today, because Israel had done a remarkable thing in making the desert
                    bloom and establishing a democratic state in the Middle East. At that time,
                    although there were the smaller parties, basically it was a two-party system. It
                    was almost a one-party system. It was the Labor party until the mid-'70s that
                    was always in power, and the Labor party didn't have many zealots. They were
                    sort of practical people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were almost a European Social Democratic party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Right. There was more socialism than some Americans liked. But it was a
                    mixed economy, and there was respect in this country for Chaim Weiszmann, Ben
                    Gurion, Golda Meir, Abba Eban. They were sort of a good bunch. And none of them
                    expressed hostility for the Arabs. The Israeli Arabs, while they may have
                    suffered some discrimination in employment, were treated decently and a lot of
                    them participated in the process at the local level, and some were in the
                    Knesset, as they still are. But I would say that the discrimination against the
                    Israeli Arab at that time was less than we had toward the blacks in this country
                    at that time. And the Arabs weren't restive within Israel.</p>
                <p>The big change in that came after the '67 War when Jordan lost what are now known
                    as the occupied territories, the West Bank, and Egypt lost Gaza. But there was
                    no national movement among the Palestinians, I think, until something like 1964,
                    and it had no power or prominence until after the '67 War. We had good
                    understanding with the leaders of Israel, and I think successive presidents
                    liked them.</p>
                <p>I should also remind you, though, that we did not give massive aid to Israel in
                    those days. It wasn't very large. As a matter of fact, they were getting their
                    military equipment basically from France. The first issue I can remember of
                    controversy was whether we would provide fighter planes to Israel. That may have
                    been in '67. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think we were then beginning to talk, maybe, about
                        the F-4s or some other planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>COHEN: And the major aid didn't start until after Camp David when these
                    tremendous commitments of aid were made to Egypt and Israel as sort of a payoff
                    for each taking a chance at Camp David. So the situation has changed a lot. And
                    as the situation became more controversial out there and the problems of the
                    Palestinians became greater, public opinion in the United States didn't change a
                    lot until recently. But certainly attitudes in each administration and among
                    members of Congress were changing and there became more willingness to hear the
                    Arab point of view. But except for, you know, a half a dozen members of Congress
                    of Arab descent, and Fulbright, who started being critical in the early '60s,
                    there was almost nobody in the Congress who was questioning anything Israel
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't feel a very heavy hand of AIPAC or anything
                        else like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: No, and AIPAC wasn't playing hardball. AIPAC started playing hardball when
                    Cy Kenan retired and Murray Amitay, who had been a foreign affairs aide to
                    Senator Ribicoff took over. He was a hardball player. I remember before he was
                    in that position, when he was still with Ribicoff, he was openly critical of
                    Ribicoff, a Jewish senator, a Democrat from Connecticut. Among the staffers he
                    would say, “Ribicoff doesn't have the kind of commitment we need for Israel,”
                    and all that sort of thing. He tended to be a little fanatical, and he started
                    putting on the pressure. He built AIPAC by having chapters in all the Jewish
                    centers throughout the country and bringing grassroots support for Israel and
                    grassroots pressure.</p>
                <p>Now, the vast majority of the American Jewish community didn't join AIPAC, but
                    enough did. And it was the biggest and heaviest lobby and most determined
                    because the traditional Jewish organizations—American Jewish Committee, American
                    Jewish Congress, B'nai B'rith, and so forth—were all supportive of Israel, and
                    they would lobby generally in a very nice way and a very acceptable way for
                    Israel. But they weren't pressuring members of Congress the way AIPAC
                    subsequently did. And then AIPAC, in the last ten, twelve years—AIPAC, although
                    it's called a political action committee, is not a fund-raising group that gives
                    money to candidates. But they encouraged the formation of, maybe, sixty or
                    eighty PACs that do that.</p>
                <p>For example, when Paul Simon was considering running against Senator Percy in the
                    '84 election, late '83, he didn't know whether he could raise the money. He and
                    Percy had always had a comfortable relationship. Although they were of different
                    parties, they were both sort of reform candidates. They had mutual respect. But
                    there was a front-page story, the major story in the Chicago Tribune one day,
                    that a certain person who was a leader in the Jewish community in Chicago,
                    although, you know, it's not one mass of people, said that he had told Simon
                    that if Simon would run, he could raise $2 million from the American Jewish
                    community to support his campaign. And the Tribune said, “Simon probably now
                    will run.” And a couple of weeks later, he announced. Now, I don't know if
                    that's why he ran, but that was a little reassurance to him on the financial
                    end.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Percy dealing with Israel up through '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: I should say that he was pretty much unquestioningly supportive of Israel
                    till '74, when he started to listen to the other side as well and started to
                    feel that if somehow Israel's security could be guaranteed it would be in
                    everybody's interest—the United States' interest, the Israeli interest—in having
                    peace and security and maybe finally being accepted by other nations in the
                    Middle East, if they would, under 242 and 338, give back some of the territories
                    and let the Palestinians have something they could call their own. And he
                    suggested from the start, you know, that might best be done if the new Palestine
                    would be in confederation with Jordan if they wanted to be.</p>
                <p>He said that publicly for the first time in January 1975, and all hell broke
                    loose against him in the Jewish community and among Christian fundamentalists
                    who are very supportive of Israel—the Jerry Falwells and so forth. He got a lot
                    of flak, thousands and thousands of telegrams and letters immediately, and
                    denunciations. And he had just come back from a trip to the Middle East where he
                    met with everybody. That was January '75.</p>
                <p>Sadat had made a profound impression on Percy. And Percy said, “I feel that Sadat
                    is a man who wants peace and can be dealt with.” That infuriated a lot of
                    people. We had to schedule a meeting a few days later with the leaders of the
                    Jewish community in Chicago, about 220. We met them in a hall in Chicago, where
                    Percy made his position clear. And a little Orthodox rabbi in the back of the
                    room, stood up, and he was beside himself. He said, “Senator, Sadat is a Nazi,
                    and I wonder about you.” Actually, you know, Sadat had been supportive of the
                    Nazis in Egypt during World War II. He was working for independence for
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think most of the Egyptian Army was. They wanted to
                        get rid of the Brits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: So that was the basis of that. Some of the Jewish community continued to
                    support Percy, especially people who had a lot of confidence in him. One man
                    very active in Jewish life in Chicago said to me, “If Senator Percy has opened
                    his eyes to something, maybe we all should. We should at least listen.” The next
                    election was in '78, and Percy got 61 percent of the Jewish vote. So he hadn't
                    been written off entirely.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But then AIPAC inspired a massive campaign in '84, first for Percy's opponent in
                    the primary, Tom Corcoran, a conservative Republican congressman from Ottawa,
                    Illinois, and then for Paul Simon. And I think every Jew in the country got at
                    least one letter in an envelope that said, “Percy: Number One Enemy of Israel in
                    the US Senate.” So in case they didn't even open it, they got that message. And
                    then they recruited a member of the board of AIPAC from California, Michael
                    Goland, a multimillionaire, to have an independent campaign, which was allowable
                    under the election law, if it were completely independent. And he spent $1.6
                    million against Percy in television ads, radio, and publications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What actually was Percy's stand by this time in '84 on
                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: His stand was the same, that there should be a negotiation for an
                    independent Palestinian state in the territories. And he never said everything
                    in the territories because he's sympathetic to Israel wanting to straighten out
                    the line where it's only eleven miles wide and things like that. But AIPAC
                    really made this the number one campaign they were focusing on in 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There you were, all the staff, dealing in international
                        affairs. Were there any ways of dealing with this? How did you try to
                        respond to this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, we've been responding since '75. I spoke in synagogues, you know,
                    usually pitted against Paul Simon's campaign manager or his legislative
                    director, and I must say that I was treated properly. Maybe in the question
                    period someone would yell an angry question or answer, but, by and large, I was
                    treated very well, fairly, and it was clear that in each place somebody was
                    primed to get me. But the audiences generally reacted in a friendly way to me,
                    perhaps because they felt it was unfair. And Percy spoke to a huge audience,
                    maybe 2,000 people, at a synagogue on the North Shore of Chicago maybe three
                    weeks before the election, and the audience was very fair. He was booed once,
                    and Paul Simon was booed once, and they were both on issues not related to the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>We ended up with about 35 percent of the Jewish vote, which isn't much below what
                    an average Republican gets anyway. But, see, we had been 61 percent six years
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you noticed a change, almost an earth change, in the
                        attitude, say, of the Jewish community after the invasion of Lebanon and the
                        massacres at the Palestinian camps and this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>COHEN: It's hard to be very precise, but I had the feeling that at the time of
                    the Lebanese war perhaps as many as forty percent, almost half the American
                    Jewish community, didn't think it was a very good idea. They were supportive up
                    to the point where the Israeli Army was supposed to stop, you recall. But when
                    they went on to Beirut, support dropped off a lot. And when they allowed the
                    fanatical Christian element to get into the Sabra and Shatila camps, support
                    dropped very quickly, and I'm sure a majority of American Jews were then
                    critical of that invasion, thought Israel should get out and stay out.</p>
                <p>I think now if you polled the American Jewish community on the invasion of
                    Lebanon, there might be 80 per cent against. The 20 per cent who like Sharon
                    might defend it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to the other lobby that was influential
                        particularly in the summer of '74 and thereafter, was the Greek lobby after
                        an abortive Greek coup on Cyprus which resulted in a counterattack and
                        takeover of a good part of the island by Turkish forces. How did that affect
                        your work and then the senator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, Greek Americans overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, condemned the
                    invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. I felt they had a point in one respect, at least,
                    and that was that the United States was aware that this was going to happen and
                    didn't intervene between Turkey and Cyprus to prevent it the way we had once
                    before. And I felt pretty strongly that we should have not allowed that to go
                    forward. And I also felt over the years that the fact that we had military and
                    intelligence bases in Turkey distorted our official view of the facts of the
                    situation and of each issue that arose between Greece and Turkey. I mean, we
                    were unerringly supportive of Turkey, come what may. And I felt that we should
                    have tried harder to use our influence with Turkey to get some restraint in what
                    they did and what they said, which was often very hostile.</p>
                <p>Also, I was personally interested in the situation in Istanbul (which Greek
                    constituents still call Constantinople), in the discrimination against the Greek
                    church there, where Turkey, in effect, after the death of Athenagoris, appointed
                    a new patriarch and restricted Greek schools and religious activities. So I
                    wasn't so pro-Turkish. Issue by issue, I tried to be fair, but I thought we were
                    in a strong enough position with Turkey—and often a stronger position than we
                    were with Greece—that we could have encouraged them to moderate what they
                    did.</p>
                <p>Also, concerning Greece, I was very critical of our cozying up to the colonels,
                    which I thought was a terrible thing. But when the colonels were overthrown,
                    then I became more sympathetic to the Greek government and thought particularly
                    over those years that we should have been more supportive of Karamanlis, who was
                    really a fine democratic leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the two administrations, the Carter
                        administration and the emphasis on human rights? How was this received by
                        Senator Percy and the committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, I think it was an educational process where politicians gradually
                    responded to public opinion, often the product of these lobbies who were
                    complaining about human rights violations in whatever area they were interested
                    in. And then it got expanded and so forth, and it started to become more of an
                    issue with the Helsinki talks and Basket Three of the Helsinki Accords. And the
                    [President Gerald] Ford administration started to pick it up tentatively. Henry
                    Kissinger, by and large, was resisting it because he thought one made foreign
                    policy decisions on other bases and that this was something to consider and try
                    to do something about privately, not publicly, unless we're talking about
                    communist violations, in which case there was something to be gained by going
                    public. That was the general feeling in the mid-'70s.</p>
                <p>Then Carter became president. Well in his campaign he talked a good deal about
                    human rights violations, and the American people responded to that—why can't
                    others be more like us, moral and upstanding and fair? Then I don't know if
                    Carter intended for Pat Derian, his assistant secretary for human rights, to go
                    as far as she did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pat Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. I don't know, but she was on the side of the angels, and people
                    couldn't say no to her in an open hearing. But I think that human rights
                    sometimes assumes an importance in foreign policy beyond what it should be. I
                    think it should be a major factor, but not the ultimate factor in deciding our
                    relations with other nations. Now, Senator Percy never expressed this or held
                    this view, maybe, as strongly as I did. But I think, in general, people
                    knowledgeable about foreign affairs have somewhat of this opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, I wonder if you could describe how you all
                        responded and saw the Reagan administration? It came in in '81, and you left
                        in '85. Here was a whole new ball game, new figures, much more a real, real
                        change ideologically. I'm speaking strictly, of course, of foreign
                        relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Well, our initial concern was greater than our ultimate concern, because
                    when Secretary [Alexander] Haig said, “We're going to the source,” it seemed
                    like he was talking about invading Cuba, which we didn't think was a desirable
                    thing to do. We had had an experience...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was concerning Nicaragua.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. Because Cuba was the source.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only Nicaragua but El Salvador, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: When George Shultz came in, we were inclined to have more confidence,
                    because we had known him for a long time. I first met him, I think in 1957, when
                    he was a professor of industrial relations at the University of Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working in Chicago, so he was sort of a hometown
                        boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: That was before he was even dean of the business school. And I remember
                    going home and telling my wife that I thought I had met a really outstanding
                    person who was very open- minded but also had strong views. I thought he was
                    strong, decent, fine, intelligent. He made a profound impression on me. And
                    Senator Percy knew him from those years, too, because Percy was on the board of
                    the university, and thought a lot of him. When he came to Washington in the
                    Nixon administration, he and Percy were very close, and I think he performed
                    very well in the jobs he had, and we were happy to have him come back.</p>
                <p>In fact, when Reagan was elected, Percy contacted him and said Shultz would be
                    the man for secretary of state. Reagan didn't tip his hand, but chose Haig.
                    Except for some of the Nicaraguan business, I don't think we had so many
                    differences with the Reagan administration, after Shultz arrived, in foreign
                    policy. But we did oppose them on things when we felt strongly. For example,
                    Percy was really the architect of the defeat of Ernie Lefever to be assistant
                    secretary for human rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Ernie Lefever was the nominee to be assistant secretary for human rights.
                    He had great reservations about the importance of pursuing human rights,
                    certainly in any public way. He gave us the impression that he would put human
                    rights way down the list of factors. And he testified in a very evasive way,
                    because there were a lot of members of the committee who were very strong for
                    human rights as a major factor in US foreign policy. And he was somewhat haughty
                    and self-righteous, and he was turning people away at every hearing, not just
                    liberal Democrats but Republicans as well. Ultimately, a majority of the
                    Republicans, as well as a majority of the Democrats, voted against him. And then
                    the next day he withdrew. It never went to a vote in the Senate. His greatest
                    supporter on the committee, I guess, was Jesse Helms.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at your overall experience, how important was the
                        Senate staff? Of the Foreign Relations Committee, one hears often that the
                        staff has grown so much—I mean, of all of Congress—and that it's really a
                        third power within the government, and in many cases they are running
                        things. You were a member of it, but looking back with some objectivity, how
                        important has the staff become or has really its relations changed much
                        particularly in the field of foreign relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Are we talking just about the staff of the Foreign Relations
                    Committee?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about foreign relations, but also as reflected,
                        too, in the personal staff of a senator. I mean, from your experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Yes. Well, I think the staff is very important, because in most offices
                    the senator's greatest input on foreign affairs is from the person he works with
                    every day. What's more, he wouldn't have hired and continued to employ that
                    person if he didn't trust that person's judgment. So the staffer is an important
                    influence.</p>
                <p>I think that it's good for senators, or members of Congress in general, to have
                    as much professional assistance as they can get. And, therefore, I think the
                    fact that funds for staffing were increased over the years, up to a point, gave
                    them more expertise on their staffs and made them less dependent on what the
                    administration and the executive agencies told them, because you know the
                    resources that the executive branch brings to bear on this. For example, even
                    though a senator now may be able to employ one senior person in foreign affairs
                    and two or three junior people doing research and so forth, that's not much to
                    compete with the State Department which can bring up a room of experts on any
                    subject and overwhelm us. And we don't know if we're always being told the
                    truth. That's more obvious with the Defense Department, I think, than with
                    State. But it happens. So members of congress need human support in these
                    specialized areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Now, it depends a lot how the relationship works. It depends on the politics, the
                    integrity, the character, the perceptiveness of the senator in how he accepts
                    information from the staff and how he uses it and what he asks of them
                    sometimes. Because he may want to take a position on an issue when the staffer
                    disagrees and the staffer will try to dissuade him. But if he doesn't dissuade
                    him, he'll have to go ahead and work that issue with the position the senator
                    wants to take. The senator was elected. I'm sure this even happens in the State
                    Department, anywhere. Some bosses become almost captive of their specialists or
                    deputies, and others just regard them as another influence or someone else to be
                    heard from. It depends on a personal relationship that develops and whether,
                    over time, the staffer really earns the trust he's been given or whether he's
                    made things more difficult for the senator. People are fired on the Hill, too.
                    Some people don't stay very long. Some people are put into other jobs.Some are
                    on the Hill to get experience, to get information, to make contacts, so that in
                    two or three years they can move out to a good job in the private sector.
                    There's a lot of in-and-out, but speaking for the offices of, maybe, some of the
                    people I knew best—Senator Percy, Senator Javits, Senator John Sherman Cooper,
                    Senator [Joseph R.] Biden, to some extent, Claiborne Pell—there were
                    relationships with their aides so close that the aides could tell them the truth
                    as they saw it and didn't have to agree, and so, therefore, were almost
                    independent influences. I mean, they would carry out a policy that the senator
                    decided on, but more often than not, if they felt strongly against something,
                    they would have some influence. Because the relationship was close, the judgment
                    of the aide was given fair consideration by the senator. And, of course, the
                    judgment of the senator had a great influence on the thinking of the aide.</p>
                <p>So these people were very influential. But that didn't mean that the senators, in
                    all their contacts, social and political, weren't open to other ideas or weren't
                    hearing other things, especially if they were on the Foreign Relations Committee
                    and almost every night were dining with State Department officials, ambassadors,
                    members of the White House staff. There was no way they could be kept in the
                    dark by an aide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting, because I think this is often
                        overlooked by those of the perspective of the State Department. They say,
                        “Well, Senator So-and-so's got an ideologue as a chief of staff and the
                        senator's the captain.” Well, particularly this would probably be true in
                        any case. If they're on a particular committee, the senators are going out
                        and getting all sorts of other things going on, which I think is
                        overlooked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One final question on this. You say the staff does research. How would you do
                    research? If we're talking about the Marines in Lebanon, this was during George
                    Shultz's time. We kept them there and we finally pulled them out. But while they
                    were there, how would you do research—I mean, you as the staff- -to give Senator
                    Percy an idea to get the Marines out or keep them in?</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>COHEN: Generally, I'd pick up the phone and talk to those who were likely to know
                    the most about it and to those who were very knowledgeable about the Lebanese
                    situation. That might include CIA, State, Defense, Brookings, AEI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AEI is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: American Enterprise Institute, which is sort of a moderate conservative
                    think tank. Sometimes I would talk to people of more extreme views—left and
                    right—to know what kind of questions we'd encounter on the floor and at press
                    conferences. And sometimes retired people who had served there- -Foreign Service
                    officers, former ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bit of networking, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Oh, of course. Of course. For example, on Vietnam, there's a professor at
                    Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Bob Tucker, who was one of my first contacts on
                    Vietnam when we came here, and he was a hawk. I thought he was the smartest hawk
                    and made the best arguments of any hawk I was talking to. And so when I would
                    come up with a dovish position for Senator Percy—if Tucker was in Baltimore—I
                    would call and ask him when he was going to be down or would he come down or
                    could I go up there, we'll have lunch or talk in his office and so forth so I
                    could just run the idea by him. I didn't say it was something Percy was going to
                    do, but that I've been thinking about this and so forth. And he would give me
                    strong arguments, and sometimes I couldn't respond to those arguments. And
                    sometimes I would drop a certain feature of the idea, because I didn't think it
                    stood up against a really smart guy. And I was much better prepared to either
                    withdraw it or to improve it or to stick with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this really points out the fact—I'll use the term
                        that “Washington” is the Greater Washington Area—is loaded with expertise
                        all over the place, which is very easy to tap and is being tapped. But this
                        is something that I don't think is often realized. We'll use the foreign
                        policy aspects. There are people going out there all the time, both through
                        the academic community, the foundations and all. Because everybody is used
                        to being in and out, so it's a great huge brother/sisterhood of
                        knowledge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COHEN: Sure, in my own work now, although I'm outside the government, I deal with
                    foreign affairs. And in addition to maintaining contacts within the government,
                    I still talk to people like Bob McCloskey and Hal Saunders and Kempton Jenkins
                    and so forth, people I respect, because they keep up with things. They're
                    networking all the time, too, and their views are still very valid, whether one
                    accepts them or not.</p>
