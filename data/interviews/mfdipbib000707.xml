                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Morris Weisz interviewing George Cabot Lodge on
                        his work in the government and since then in the field of international
                        labor. Today is Wednesday, February 24, 1993, and we are seated in George's
                        beautiful hotel room in Washington, D.C., and he has been kind enough to
                        give us some time to be interviewed for our Labor Diplomacy Oral History
                        Project. George, would you tell us your background and how you got into the
                        Labor Department and into international work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: I was a newspaper reporter after graduating from Harvard College in 1950.
                    I went to work for the Boston Herald as a political reporter covering the state
                    house, and I was firmly convinced that my life was going to be in journalism.
                    One of the reasons was that I had such a bad stutter that I could hardly speak,
                    so I concluded that I had to do something which involved writing rather than
                    talking. One day I interviewed the Secretary of Labor, James P. Mitchell, when
                    he came to make a speech in Bangor, Maine. He landed at the airport in Boston
                    and I drove in the car with him from Boston to Bangor. I remember I asked him 96
                    questions. I had them all written out from having researched his life in the
                    newspaper morgue. At the end of the interview he said, “Listen, I need a speech
                    writer, so why don't you come down and write speeches for me?” For a variety of
                    reasons, which I won't go into now, that sounded appealing. Among other things,
                    the pay was three times what I was making as a newspaper reporter, so at great
                    personal sacrifice so to speak I went to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were married at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: I was married. I had three children. I came down and within about a month
                    miraculously I found myself Director of Information in the Department of Labor,
                    which was a very big job for somebody like me who at the time was 27 years old.
                    I had flags behind my desk and field offices and lots of staff and we put out
                    all the publications of the Department of Labor. Then in June of that year—I
                    went down there in about February—it was the famous year that the Russians came
                    back into the International Labor Organization (ILO) after an absence of, I
                    guess, since World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this have been 1953?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: This was 1954, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Wilkins had been the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Wilkins was the Assistant Secretary. So the Russians came back into the
                    ILO, because all of the data on forced labor in the Gulag was beginning to come
                    out in those years, and it was coming out through the ILO, so that the ILO
                    Conference that year was peculiarly exciting politically. There was an item on
                    the agenda to pass a convention on forced labor on the basis of all of this
                    documentation. So the Secretary, Mr. Mitchell, was concerned about the debate
                    and the controversy. The Russian delegate was a very distinguished Russian
                    diplomat, Amosas Aritunian (phonetic), who I think later went on to become the
                    Soviet Ambassador to Canada at a time when Canada was the place where the Soviet
                    North American spy ring was organized. Aritunian was one of their real hotshots.
                    The Secretary was concerned about the delegation, so he said to me one day,
                    “Look, you better go with the delegation to Geneva.” And I said, “But what am I
                    supposed to do?” And he said, “Well, I don't know. I can't make you a member of
                    the delegation because you don't know anything. Why don't you just...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I knew Mitchell, he did not say, “You don't know
                        anything.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, implicit was... I mean I had no portfolio which would justify my
                    official presence on the delegation. I wasn't an expert in anything, and so he
                    said, “Why don't you just go and make yourself useful.” So I read everything I
                    could read on forced labor and I remember getting on the plane at Idlewild
                    Airport, as it was then called, with a trunk, literally a trunk, full of all of
                    this data coming out about forced labor in [the Soviet Union].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, the head of our delegation then was our
                        Assistant Secretary for International Labor Affairs Ernest Wilkins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: That's right. So I got on the Swiss Air plane, and as you remember in
                    those days Government officials went first class, so I was sitting in the first
                    class cabin of Swiss Air, sopping up vodka, when who should come and sit beside
                    me but Warren Burger, who was then a young assistant to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A member of the Delegation [to the ILO Conference]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LODGE: Yes. He was an Assistant Attorney General; later, of course, he went on to
                    become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. So there we were sitting next to each
                    other, enjoying the hospitality of Swiss Air, and he said, “By the way, do you
                    know anything about the ILO?” And I said, “Boy, do I know anything about the
                    ILO!” and I gave a speech growing out of all of the briefing documents that I
                    had been collecting, telling him about the ILO. He said, “Because I am...”—I
                    forget what his title was, but he was an assistant delegate or something like
                    that. So we got to know each other very well in that Swiss Air plane, and when
                    we got there, of course, the rest of the Free World was looking to the United
                    States for leadership. The French and the British and everybody else were
                    saying, “What are we going to do about this very important debate coming up on
                    forced labor and who is going to say this and who is going to say that and so
                    on?” Well, for one reason or another, Mr. Wilkins wasn't feeling well. He had a
                    bad stomach problem and he was in his room. He had a difficult time, I think, in
                    those early years making a decision. The debate came nearer and nearer, and we
                    in the U.S. Delegation were not very well organized. So I said to myself, “What
                    am I supposed to do now?” and I remember calling Mr. Mitchell and saying, “You
                    know, we have a bit of a problem here. The Free World is looking to us for
                    leadership, and we are not really very well set up.” (Pause in the tape)</p>
                <p>Well, so anyway, I was involved in writing speeches for Warren Burger and the
                    others who were leading the debate on force labor and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Phil Delaney there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Phil Delaney was there for the AFL-CIO. So that's what I did and then a
                    year or so later—I don't remember exactly, in 1956 perhaps.—Mr. Wilkins was ill
                    and resigned and the Secretary appointed me Assistant Secretary. At the time, I
                    said, “Are you sure that you want to name me to this job?” because at that time
                    I still had a very bad stutter. I said, “How am I going to lead the Free World
                    against the forces of evil, if I can't speak?” He said, and I'll never forget
                    it, “Don't you worry about it. I don't worry about it.” So I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>I remember the day I overcame my stutter. We were at an ILO Conference in June of
                    1956. Amosas Aritunian (phonetic) was still the Russian delegate, and he was
                    making a speech in which he referred to the Taft-Hartley Act as “the slave labor
                    act.” The rule was that if the Soviet delegation or any of the other delegations
                    took a crack at the U.S. and named the U.S., we had to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: to make an immediate reply.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LODGE: ...we had to stand up and say something. So I said, “Okay, here it is.” Up
                    goes my hand and I climbed those stairs in the old League of Nations Building
                    there, you know the Palais des Nations. It must be fifty feet up to the podium,
                    and there's Aritunian like a bear behind the podium glaring down at me. To this
                    day I don't remember what I said. I don't remember anything except coming down
                    from the podium and coming back to the U.S. desk and I asked... Who was the nice
                    fellow from State who advised the delegation?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Do you remember?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember. It wasn't Dan Goott?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: No, it wasn't Dan Goott. No, it was... Anyway, the State Department man
                    was sitting there, and I said, “How did I do?” and he said, “Well, you did
                    okay.” So I guess I didn't stutter. But from that moment on, it became possible
                    for me to sort of control it. In any case, that is how I became Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you comment—because nobody has as yet and of course
                        we don't have Wilkins—on the attitude of the U.S. Government and of the U.S.
                        trade unions and employers on allowing the Russians to come back in [to the
                        ILO]? You said that Phil Delaney represented the AFL-CIO and, of course, you
                        know that when this began the AFL and the CIO were separate. There were two
                        different attitudes, the AFL's and the CIO's. Could you comment on
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes. Well, there was considerable antagonism, of course, especially on the
                    part of the AFL, and on the part of the employers. Who was the employer
                    delegate? McGrath? Was that his name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, but I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LODGE: The Soviets were staying in the Hotel Richmonde, I think, and they had the
                    Russian flag outside the hotel. No, that was a later time. His suite was over
                    the front door where the flags went out, and he wouldn't let the guy go through
                    his room to put the flag on the pole in front of the hotel. Anyway, there was a
                    great deal of antagonism because both the labor and management representatives
                    said that the Soviet and satellite delegations were not tripartite, that they
                    had no free labor movement, that they had no free employer movement and so
                    everybody was a government representative, which was, I suppose, true. So there
                    was a kind of a fiction that we decided to sustain, the idea being that it was
                    better to have them in the organization than outside it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the [U.S.] Government's position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: That was the Government's position, and since they [the Soviets] were in
                    the U. N., I am not sure we could legally have kept them out, even if we had
                    decided that it would have been a good idea. But the Government position was
                    that they should be in. Now every year there was a credentials battle, which the
                    employers and I think the labor delegates as well initiated, to expel the Soviet
                    and satellite employer and worker delegations, so that they would have just a
                    government representative. And I don't remember the ins and outs of it
                    constitutionally but I remember Mr. Jenks, who was the ILO lawyer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Secretary General? Lawyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes, Jenks was... David Morse was the Director General and this marvelous
                    British lawyer Jenks, who had been around forever...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who ultimately succeeded Morse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: I guess he did, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a brief time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LODGE: Well, his arguments about the Constitution of the ILO eventually won the
                    day and the Soviets and the satellites were allowed in, I think, with all of
                    their employer and labor representatives. There was, of course, the point that
                    in many other countries, as well as the Soviet Union, the employer delegations
                    and the worker delegations were hardly free. Indeed, there was the suspicion
                    that even in some of the European countries, the employer and the worker
                    delegates did what their government told them to do. In some ways, I suppose, we
                    and the British were practically the only countries in the world that were
                    pristine in that respect, and we certainly were, because as you undoubtedly
                    recall, countless times we would vote three different ways, if that was
                    possible. There was very little control that the American Government had over
                    the American employer or worker delegate.</p>

                <p>LODGE: Oh, indeed. Oh, indeed. I loved Phil. In fact, he bought my second hand
                    car when I left Washington, and I don't think it worked very long afterwards.
                    (Laughter!) But he was a great guy and we had a wonderful time together. And

                <p>LODGE: Mike Ross of the CIO and I used to have wonderful times together playing
                    chess. I remember we played chess all night long one night and you remember he
                    was gassed during World War I.</p>

                <p>LODGE: [He had a] terrible cough and smoked incessantly. It's amazing he lived at

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you will, speak for a moment about the relations
                        between the government and the worker and management delegations. You had
                        different views on many subjects but got along reasonably well. You had
                        caucuses and things like that. To what degree were the Labor Attach�s
                        involved in that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LODGE: As I recall it, the governmental relationships with the labor people were
                    far better than the governmental relationships with the employer people,
                    because—now it is coming back to me—the employer people thought that the United
                    States should get out of the ILO because of the presence of these Eastern
                    European countries and on the basis that the ILO was a fraud. So we had this
                    constant battle with the employers on that issue, which we did not have with the
                    labor delegates. They accepted it. So the differences were very minor really
                    with the labor people and very fundamental with the employer people. Now, your
                    question was concerning the Labor Attach�s.</p>

                <p>LODGE: In those early years, as I recall it, there were not very many Labor

                </p>
                <p>LODGE: With the Marshall Plan, yes. So, to tell you the truth, [as far as] the
                    presence of Labor Attach�s at the ILO [was concerned], in those early years
                    there just weren't very many of them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Well, you went every year to the ILO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes, and then I was elected Chairman of the Governing Body in 1958 or
                    1959. 1959, I guess. As Chairman of the Governing Body, I went to all the ILO
                    regional conferences. I can tell you some great stories about that. The African
                    Regional Conference, I remember. I guess it was in 1960. Phillip Heller was the
                    wonderful Labor Attach� in Guinea and I had been responsible for hiring him.
                    I'll tell you about that too, when Norman Thomas came in and told me I had
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't tell you that. I can explain the
                        circumstances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: He recommended him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He recommended him. He wrote to me and said, “How can we
                        get Phil Heller, who had been fired under the Marshall Plan, appointed
                        again?” I suggested that he write a letter to [Secretary of Labor] Mitchell
                        with a copy to me. I then sent a note upstairs [in the Labor Department]
                        saying, “This is a good fellow. We fired him from the Marshall Plan. I think
                        you should do what you can to help him. And from that point on you can pick
                        up the story. But Norman [Thomas] didn't demand it. He was very
                        wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, when Norman Thomas made a recommendation, if you recall, it was
                    pretty close to a demand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why I told him to write to Secretary Mitchell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: He came to see me and he told me about Phillip Heller. I remember I said,
                    “Now, where does he want to go? Paris or Rome or somewhere?” [Thomas replied],
                    “Oh, no. He wants to go to a developing country. He wants to go to the toughest
                    spot you've got.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you sent him to one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: At that time Sekou Toure was in charge in Guinea, and he was a Marxist or
                    at least advertised as such. Our Ambassador there couldn't get anything done. He
                    couldn't even get to see Toure. He couldn't get eyeglass prescriptions fixed. He
                    was holed up in the Embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Ambassador or Phil? LODGE: The Ambassador.
                        This was before Phil went there. So Phil came in to see me and I said to
                        myself, “Here's a guy who speaks fluent French. He's a Marxist scholar.
                        So...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But very anti-Communist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: And very anti-Communist. “...so what better place to send him than
                    Guinea.” Well, you can imagine the problems that we had with the clearances, and
                    the F.B.I., and Bob Murphy in State. It took a direct intervention by Secretary
                    Mitchell at the White House for us to get Phillip Heller appointed. He went out
                    there. Sekou Toure heard that there was a French-speaking Marxist in the
                    American Embassy, and he sent down word that he wanted to see this fellow. And
                    do you know that, as far as I can recall, every week for years Phillip Heller
                    would have dinner with Sekou Toure. They would give him a bag full of the broken
                    glasses and the prescriptions to be filled and stuff, and he would take it up
                    there. But he was the only contact that the American Government had with that
                    Government for years and I guess they kept him there...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he had a number of things, but the bad thing that
                        turned up when he came back was a kidney [problem], and he didn't last too
                        long. He had to have dialysis.</hi>

                <p>LODGE: What a hero!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see that we are going to take up all your time
                        today, but this is very important. We have been interviewing a whole lot of
                        people from the early period, because they are the ones who have been dying
                        off, not including Phil [Heller] by the way, who died before we started this
                        project, and what we find—and there's a whole lot on the Marshall Plan
                        period from people like me—what we find is that the Labor Attach�s,
                        especially those who came from the labor movement like Heller and from the
                        Socialist movement, did have certain great advantages. There were some
                        disadvantages too, when they started getting involved to the degree that
                        they did in the internal situation, which wasn't the case with Phil Heller
                        in Guinea, but most of the time they had an appreciation of the political
                        aspects.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LODGE: Absolutely. I was telling you about the African regional conference, where
                    I was the Chairman of the Governing Body, so I presided over the conference. The
                    first day some of the Communist representatives from Ghana or somewhere produced
                    this document which purported to be a top-secret paper from the British Foreign
                    Office, in which the British Government was describing how it was going to use
                    African trade unions to promote its nefarious business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through the British Council probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: It looked just like a British Foreign Office document, red borders,
                    top-secret, and all the rest. So the conference was in utter confusion with this
                    document circulating around. Well now, I remember Phillip Heller was there, and
                    he said to me, “You got to come with me one night, because I think I know how we
                    can fix this.” So we went—and I don't recall exactly why—but we were sort of
                    pub-crawling in Lagos, which was where the Conference was, and he was
                    introducing me to all these people, these friends of his from the Ghanaian labor
                    movement who were there. I guess I was sort of a front man for Phillip to allow
                    him to do whatever he was doing, but anyway the next morning somehow it was
                    discovered, by virtue of Heller's intervention, that the typewriter on which
                    this thing had been typed was discovered and connected to the Ghanaian Communist
                    Party, so that was disclosed and the Conference went on. But that was something
                    that he did. He was a great guy. There were lots of people like that. I'm trying
                    to remember the guy whom I last met in Vietnam, who was Labor Attach� there.</p>

                        political background, but he had experience in negotiating labor
                        [agreements], for the Army incidentally, and came into the Labor Attach�
                        Corps in that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, you see, it was during my tenure as Assistant Secretary that, I
                    don't know how many, but many, many of those men were hired. It was in that time
                    period when all of these developing countries of Africa and Asia were becoming
                    independent that the need for Labor Attach�s was realized, because the leaders
                    of these countries were all trade union people because of the colonial
                    tradition. So I had an opportunity to hire, I don't know, a dozen Labor Attach�s
                    including Condon and Heller and a fellow from the Teamsters, I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember him. But that has to be stressed and
                        you'll be interested to know, especially since you came from a Republican

                        was making the same points about... He succeeded you, didn't he, as
                        Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: I guess, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he did, because there was a little overlap. You
                        stayed on for a little bit longer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: No, no. George Weaver succeeded me. He was before me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Phil [Kaiser] preceded you and he was making the same
                        point in his [interview]. Yes, George Weaver succeeded you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Phil Kaiser, of course, was there at the beginning of
                        the Marshall Plan. He had more to do with the designation of those early
                        [Labor Attach�s]. Well, you certainly are supporting the general view that
                        the employment of people with this type of background was helpful...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LODGE: Oh, it was critical. Take David Burgess in India and the role that he
                    played in bringing to the attention of the United States Government the role of
                    those Indian trade unions, because, as you know, before that time, diplomatic
                    relations were carried on between the Embassy and the Palace, so to speak. There
                    wasn't anybody who knew much, if anything, about what was going on in these
                    critically important labor movements. I recall the controversy, the fights, that
                    we had with State in terms of getting this perception included in the way the
                    State Department looked at things. I often thought that it was bureaucratically
                    fortunate that the Assistant Secretary of Labor for International Affairs wasn't
                    in the State Department, because being outside enabled me to get access to, for
                    example the Operations Coordinating Board of the NSC, on which I sat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Board of the Foreign Service. Did you sit on the
                        Board of the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: I think so, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an important place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Very important. So being outside and having Secretary Mitchell such a
                    strong supporter, I think, was probably a good idea, because I think there was
                    considerable resistance in the State Department to the recognition of this new
                    phenomenon and they were nervous about it. Of course, in the ILO, [there was]
                    the whole Bricker Amendment issue, which the State Department was very sensitive
                    about and which prevented us from supporting these conventions against force
                    labor and against discrimination. I forget which one it was, but I voted for one
                    convention on abolishing forced labor. The position paper from the State
                    Department said the United States will abstain, because it is matter for the
                    states. Well, if I had abstained, there would have been two countries
                    abstaining; the Soviet Union and the U.S. would have been abstaining on a vote
                    on a convention to condemn forced labor. I said to myself, “I'm not going to do
                    it. I'm just not going to do it.” And I remember Under Secretary of State Robert
                    Murphy came over to see Secretary Mitchell and demanded that I be fired. There
                    was a big meeting in Mitchell's office and I was called in. It was the only time
                    I ever saw Mitchell completely lose his temper. He just got so angry at Murphy
                    for suggesting this. Then Mr. Murphy left and Mitchell turned to me and he said,
                    “Well, how was that?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>George, I wonder, since we will probably be taping many more interviews with you,
                    if you would mention now your writings, beginning with Spearheads for Democracy,
                    which has a kind word for me in the introduction.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LODGE: That's right. Well, that book I wrote in 1961. I was reappointed to my job
                    by President Kennedy and I stayed on a while and then...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was because of some ILO meeting they wanted you to go
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, I was Chairman of the Governing Body, but I was a very close friend
                    of Bobby Kennedy. How I got to be that is a story all by itself. He was the
                    Counsel for the McClellan Committee in the late 1950s, you will recall, and I
                    was concerned that by exposing the villainies of some trade union leaders, he
                    was tarring the whole movement with the brush of corruption. I didn't know him,
                    so I went up to see him in his office there in the House Office Building. He, of
                    course, was in his shirt sleeves with books all around him and very busy, two
                    phones at his ears, and all the rest. So I came in and I was standing there
                    shifting from one foot to the other and finally Bobby put his head up and he
                    said, “Well, what the hell do you want?” He said, “Who are you anyway?” And I
                    said, “Well, I'm George Lodge. I'm from the Labor Department. I'm concerned that
                    this exposure you're doing here of the labor movement of these corrupt labor
                    leaders will tarnish the whole movement.” And Bobby said something like, “Why do
                    you waste my time with that! Do I give a damn about that?” So I said, “Okay”,
                    and I turned around to leave. Just as I was about to go out the door, he said,
                    “Hey, what are you doing Sunday?” I said, “Nothing.” He said, “Why don't you
                    come out to Hickory Hill and play touch football.” Now that was in about 1958, I
                    think. I was the captain of the losing touch football team from that day forth,
                    and I became a very close friend of Bobby's. So when the Kennedy Administration
                    came in, I was reappointed, partly, I think, because of my friendship for Bobby,
                    but also as Chairman of the Governing Body, I had to fill out my term. They
                    wanted me to stay. I somehow didn't think it was a career job being Assistant
                    Secretary of Labor, so I didn't. In the last few months, I wrote this book,
                    Spearheads of Democracy, with which you helped me and many others helped me. The
                    idea was to set down the role of labor in developing countries during that
                    critical time period from about 1956 to the early 1960s, when these ex-colonial
                    countries were becoming independent.</p>
                <p>Now in that book is a chapter, I forget the number, but it is called, “The Truth
                    about the American Economic System.” It has an interesting story connected to
                    it, because, I think it was in 1958, I was in India and David Burgess took me
                    around to see the Indian trade union leaders. Along the way I was supposed to go
                    on Indian national radio with Ashok Mehta, the famous and marvelous old man, who
                    was the leader of the Indian Socialist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the man I had a letter of introduction to from Norman
                        Thomas, when I went to India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Really. A great man. Of course, I didn't know who he was. I was totally
                    ignorant.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the fact that Burgess could get you in to see him is
                        the interesting thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, it was a radio show, where we were both supposed to be talking about
                    economic systems. Q: Was this before or after he had spent that year or long
                    period in Hawaii at the East-West Center, because that influenced him
                    considerably?</p>
                <p>LODGE: I think it was after. In any case, I never took an economics course at
                    Harvard. I knew nothing fundamental about the American economy, so on the way to
                    the radio station, we stopped off at the Embassy and I went to see the USIA
                    people to get a sort of a poop sheet on the American economy, because I figured
                    I had to have something to talk about. So in the taxi on the way over [to the
                    radio studio], I read this brochure about free enterprise and self-reliance and
                    initiative. So I said to myself, “Well, I know about Ralph Waldo Emerson. This
                    is just Emerson sort of warmed over.” So I got on the radio and, mind you, I
                    don't know how many millions of people listen to the radio in India, but it was
                    a big audience, and I go on about the American economic system, free enterprise
                    and free markets and free this and free that. Then Ashok Mehta says, “Now, Mr.
                    Lodge, in your speech you said nothing about minimum wage; you didn't mention
                    the Tennessee Valley Authority; you didn't mention the government programs to
                    support agriculture; you didn't mention unemployment insurance; you didn't
                    mention social security.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He sure had been at the East-West Center before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: And he said, “Now, tell me. What are these things? Are they un-American?”
                    So I said, “Good point!” And then he said, “Now, you people are the capitalists,
                    right?” I said, “That's right.” “And we're socialists.” I said, “That's right.”
                    He said, “Now can you tell me what percentage of the gross national product is
                    disposed of by government in the United States?” I didn't even know what the
                    gross national product was, much less what percentage [was accounted for by the
                    public sector]. He said, “Well, I'll tell you. 22 percent.” Now he said, “India.
                    What percentage of the gross national product is disposed of by the government
                    in India?” Of course by this time I was on the ropes, you know, groggy. He said,
                    “I'll tell you. 12 percent. Now, which country is the capitalist and which is
                    the socialist?” I said, “That's a good point.” So mercifully the program ended,
                    after which he said to me, “Would you mind telling me why you people use this
                    work 'capitalism'. Do you know what it means to the people who are listening to
                    this program? It means the local loanshark, the money-lender, the racist, the
                    imperialist. It doesn't mean anything like your system in the United States, and
                    yet you persist in using this word.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, George, but you could just as well have said,
                        “What do you mean by socialism?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Well, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...because he was very far from what we think of as a
                        “socialist”. So it's the use of that word that is attractive to the
                        developing countries and the use of the word “capitalist” that is so
                        unattractive to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: That's right. Unattractive. And he said, “By socialism we mean government
                    with a social conscience. By my definition, you in the United States are
                    socialist.” Well, anyway, I came back to Washington and I went to see USIA. I
                    said, “You know, you got to do something. Sending the likes of me on a program
                    where millions of people are listening with that kind of crap to describe the
                    American economic system, it's crazy!” So whoever it was said, “All right, if
                    you are so smart, you write something up.” So I wrote a paper called, “The Truth
                    about the American Economic System”, where I tried to say what it was. I sent it
                    over to them and they said, “Oh, geez, we couldn't possibly print this. We are
                    already in trouble with the Congress. They think we are a bunch of pinkos down
                    here, you know. They would cut our budget to ribbons. We couldn't possibly use
                    this.” So I'm at a dinner a few nights later with Milton Eisenhower, who you
                    remember was a great guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the head of the University of Maryland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Johns Hopkins. He became President of Johns Hopkins afterwards, but he was
                    the President's brother. And I was telling him this story. He said, “Let me see
                    the paper.” So I sent it over to him and the next thing I know USIA is back on
                    the phone. They said, “Hey, let us see that paper.” So the next thing I know,
                    USIA has done it up in a little brochure. Somebody in Congress hears about it,
                    puts the whole thing in the Congressional Record, and says, “It's great.” U.S.
                    Steel buys I don't know how many copies, sends it around the world. So I say to
                    myself, “What is going on here? The United States Government won't tell the
                    truth about the American economic system for fear of what Congress will do. When
                    they tell the truth, Congress says great. What is it that's at work here? And of
                    course it is ideology. That is to say, it's a collection of ideas that prevents
                    us from being realistic.”</p>
                <p>That was the beginning of my life's work since leaving the Labor Department. I
                    have written the eight books since: The New American Ideology, The American
                    Disease, Perestroika for America. All these books have really emanated from that
                    experience when I was Assistant Secretary, where you see the critical importance
                    of ideology and how the American ideology blinds so many of us Americans to our
                    own reality and to the reality of other places. Of course this was a particular
                    problem in the late 1950s with the McCarthy thing and Scott McLeod and all the
                    rest of them.</p>

                        of the books, so we will have it with your interview and you've been

                <p>LODGE: What I teach about is essentially business, government and the
                    international economy. I teach comparative ideology in effect. What I have been
                    trying to do is to make ideology into a multidisciplinary discipline, so that
                    you can look at a place like Japan and you can see it as a system: political,
                    social, economic, cultural, institutional. You can see the ideas that hold it
                    together and compare those ideas to Germany, U.S., England, Mexico, Brazil, and
                    this gives you... (End of tape)</p>
                <p>What I have been doing is trying to make ideology into a multidisciplinary
                    discipline, to compare countries and to understand change within a country. Take
                    the United States, for example, the dominant ideology in the United States has
                    been what I would call “individualism”, the accentuation of property rights,
                    competition in the marketplace, the limited state and so on. For a long time in
                    fact that ideology has been changing, that is in institutional practice, as
                    Ashok Mehta point out to me, that ideology is not what we actually do. So I have
                    been thinking and writing about what it is we actually do; what is the
                    ideological reflection of what we actually do; and what is the consequence of
                    having one ideology that we preach and another one that we practice?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The adjustment to reality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: But it is equally [applicable] to management, because if managers are
                    going to be realistic, they've got to get what they preach and what they
                    practice in harmony, and they've got to understand that these semi-religious
                    notions, upon which many of them rely for authority, aren't there. They are just
                    not valid anymore. They are not acceptable. And, of course, the ecological
                    movement and foreign competition now have proven that. The union movement has
                    the same problem. I remember I wrote a book with... Well, I'll remember [the
                    name]. He's a British professor from the London School of Economics. We wrote a
                    book for the Trilateral Commission in the early 1970's.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Is he? Well, we did this book about what was happening in the labor
                    movements of U.S., Europe, and Japan. There was a Japanese [co-author] too. And
                    I remember talking about what I regarded as sort of an irreversible trend in the
                    United States away from what I would call “contract” toward “consensus”, away
                    from the conception of the National Labor Relations Act of adversarial,
                    contractual bargaining, and that this [trend] was irreversible and inevitable
                    because the American system was uncompetitive. It wasn't going to be able to
                    compete with the systems of Japan and Germany, so it was either going to change
                    or die. Well, this paper was submitted in draft to Lane Kirkland and people at
                    the AFL-CIO. Of course, they thought I was the devil. And I remember Glen Watts
                    said to Lane [Kirkland], “Lane, George is the messenger. He just bringing you
                    the message. This is what's happening.”</p>

                <p>LODGE: Yes. We all have this problem. Academics have a problem of confusing

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and he's so articulate. Well, based on your views on
                        ideology, what type or types of people should be in the diplomatic service
                        in the general labor field? How do you select them? How do you train them?
                        Any comments on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: First of all, let's start ideologically. They have to be open-minded and
                    they have to be intellectually interested in what the labor movements of the
                    world are interested in. They have to be people who are engaged by the kinds of
                    issues that seize and interest labor people, without obviously being committed
                    to any particular ideology. They have to be ideologically aware.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's important, the idea of commitment as against a
                        sympathetic interest in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes, exactly, and they can't be ideologically hidebound, that is they
                    can't be so dedicated to “individualism” that they have no respect for the
                    “communitarian” or vice versa. I mean, they have to be tolerant in the larger
                    sense, more tolerant perhaps than people dealing in other parts of diplomacy.
                    And they have to be intellectually tolerant. It can't be just put on. It has to
                    be sincere, because I think that labor people the world over see through fakes,
                    and you are not dealing with diplomats for whom fakery is part of the deal. You
                    are dealing with people who are trade union leaders, and they are not diplomats.
                    So you have to have this type of person who is good at that, and if you have had
                    some experience in a union, that, needless to say, is often helpful, but it may
                    not be. My own view would be that experience in a union is not an essential
                    prerequisite. Much more important is the sort of person that you are and your
                    general level of intelligence, of sensitivity, of personality. I can think of
                    some trade unionists who probably shouldn't be Labor Attach�s. And yet, of
                    course, if you get the right sort, they are ideal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the training you would give them? We have now
                        cut down from the one year training period we used to have for ordinary—you
                        call it “stick” diplomats—in which we gave them a full [labor] education. We
                        had the Harvard trade union training. Now, we are down to just a few weeks
                        in the summer, which they can spare. Then when they go out they are
                        disadvantaged by the fact that they get so many additional duties to labor
                        duties. So when you have a conflict between following labor matters, and
                        then making good contributions to policy decisions, and assignments of
                        on-going reporting in other fields, we don't have the luxury nowadays. So if
                        you have any suggestions as to how to train these people in the limited time
                        we have, I would appreciate it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>LODGE: Well, you know, I am talking right now off the top of my head, because I
                    haven't thought about this for a long time but as I think about it in some ways
                    both the training and the assignment of someone in this field in different
                    countries should be perhaps different. That is, I think of the Labor Attach� to
                    Japan. The Labor Attach� to Japan has a completely different job than say the
                    Labor Attach� to the U.K. or France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like the person we were talking about, Phil Heller,
                        who had a very different position in Europe as against Guinea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Yes. Now if you're a Labor Attach� in Japan, you've got to spend as much
                    time with managers as you do with union people. Indeed most of the managers have
                    been union leaders, so it's a completely different set-up than the U.S. has or
                    the U.K. or most Western [countries]. Take Singapore, for example; if you were
                    Labor Attach� in Singapore, your job would be very different and the things you
                    would need to know would be very different. In any Asian country, now that I
                    think about it, you just don't have Western unions, and you don't have the same
                    ideology of labor and management. You got a very different set-up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are saying that the training should consist of
                        largely learning about the country you are going to rather than labor
                        history in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Absolutely. Labor history in the United States is almost totally useless
                    as far as I am concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's useful in terms of how different you have to approach
                        the problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LODGE: Right. It is so anachronistic. I mean the U.K. and the U.S... The more I
                    think about the world, the more peculiar the U.K. and the U.S. are. We are so
                    different from everybody else. Somehow the training of a Labor Attach� has got
                    to really immerse the person in these differences of culture, of politics, of
                    ideology, of everything of the place where he or she is going. I don't know how
                    long that takes, and it may go to the sort of people you recruit, the sort of
                    education they have had before you recruit them. Ideally they would have some
                    language and they would have some education before hand which would equip
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, I have to leave and you have to leave, and what I
                        would like to do, because it takes some time to pack up, I'd like to send
                        you some of the material on this subject, some that I have written and some
                        that other people have written, and then maybe develop a series of questions
                        to continue this either when we have a person up there or you are down here
                        on some future trip.</hi>
