                <p>RITA M. WYSONG</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Frances M. Caterini</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 10, 1996</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rita, did you work before you became a Foreign Service
                        wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Since wives didn't work in the Foreign Service back in the 40's, I didn't
                    either. However, in 1966 at our last post, Khartoum, Sudan, I was hired by two
                    lawyers from a private foundation in the States. For several months I typed
                    court cases. I believe I had to have permission to do this. When we left
                    Khartoum, I recommended a friend to continue the work I had been doing.</p>
                <p>My husband retired, and after we returned to the States, he attended graduate
                    school. I was employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society and then took a
                    County/State job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me how you and your husband met, and
                        something about your various posts in the Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Well I met my husband in Oklahoma at the college in Stillwater. Bob was
                    in the Army, and I was a WAVE in the Navy. Shortly after I was sent to
                    Washington to work in the Department of Communications, he was sent to the
                    University of Minnesota where he studied Swedish. The following year (1944) he
                    was stationed near Washington, where we married.</p>
                <p>We lived in California and then in Panama. In 1946, he was flown to the State
                    Department to take the oral exams for the Foreign Service. We were both pleased
                    to hear that he'd passed the exa(he had previously passed the written exam).</p>
                <p>In 1947, we were both sent to Washington, D.C. so he could take the training
                    program at the Foreign Service Institute. There were about five other wives in
                    the group and we often sat in on the sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, your first posting was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Mexico City.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reaction to Mexico City?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Well, I loved it. So did Bob. However, after a while, he got tired of
                    doing mainly visa work and wanted to branch out. I had some say in this since we
                    had a 9-month-old baby girl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you transferred later to M�rida, Yucatan, what were
                        some of the problems you faced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: A lot more problems than in Mexico city, that's for sure. The food
                    situation in the markets was not good. Fortunately, we'd had a large food order
                    of canned goods sent to supplement our fresh food supply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And from there you went to Sao Paulo, which was quite an
                        adjustment, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: It was a “plum,” and was referred to as the “Detroit of Latin
                    America.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are some of your most vivid memories of Sao
                        Paulo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We enjoyed the social life, which included dining at restaurants and
                    attending theaters—not found in M�rida.</p>
                <p>The fresh fruits and vegetables were abundant and cheap. I remember dahlias in
                    vivid colors, alarge around as dinner plates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your next post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We were assigned to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first reaction when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WYSONG: I could hardly believe my eyes, because it looked like a medieval city.
                    The old wall around the town had just been torn down, and it looked very
                    primitive. The Embassy driver took us to our modern, pre-fab house at the
                    Embassy compound located outside of town. I remember my nephew, who is a
                    professional writer, saying that here was his aunt, a midwestern girl, being
                    sent to the “land of the veils.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that your book had a vivid section on Jeddah social
                        life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: At the first big party we Embassy wives attended, I felt as though we
                    were in a scene out of “Arabian Nights.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell about some of the holidays in Saudi Arabia. Easter,
                        for instance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We women made little Easter baskets out of coffee cans we had painted and
                    filled with colored eggs.</p>
                <p>For Christmas, Santa came to Jeddah by sea. The children were excited to see him
                    being rowed to the shoreline in a little boat. We assumed he must have been very
                    warm in his red suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do shopping in the local markets for
                        trinkets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Occasionally. We bought copper and brass pots. Later, Bob got a very good
                    buy on some Persian rugs which are still beautiful.</p>
                <p>We did a little shopping in the markets for food. Almost everything was imported.
                    We had a large shipment of canned goods from the States. To supplement our food
                    supply, we often went fishing in the Embassy launch. The fish from the Red Sea
                    were excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about some of the hobbies you enjoyed in
                        Jeddah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Let's see, actually there weren't too may hobbies. We women met once a
                    week for coffee and also attended teas with the other English-speaking
                    wives.</p>
                <p>I don't think we hardly ever got sick while in Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? Too dry? The germs didn't thrive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WYSONG: I guess not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your children enjoyed swimming? Did they swim in the
                        sea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Yes, they loved playing in the water at the beach.</p>
                <p>I am almost sure some of the Arabs were scandalized when they saw us American
                    women in our bathing suits. Arab men and little boys wore bathing suits, but the
                    women sat on the banks sweltering in the heat. They were completely covered in
                    black from head to toe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other memories you have of your time in Saudi
                        Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: There were the rich and the very poor. Some Saudis were very wealthy, and
                    so were officials of Middle Eastern embassies.</p>
                <p>The very poor — including the nomads — seemed to be resigned to their lot in
                    life. When Jeddah was hit by a locust plague, and every green thing in sight was
                    consumed by the locusts, the poor Arabs watched the sky and ate locusts when
                    they came down. They also liked the insects roasted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us about your next post in Tijuana, Mexico,
                        and how you lived in Chula Vista, California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Every morning Bob would get up , drive to work and cross the border into
                    Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to go to Mexico to do any entertaining or go
                        to social events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Yes, we did go to social events. And we went to a bull fight once.
                    Actually, we didn't spend much time in Tijuana. It was a wide open town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not so pleasant to be in ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: No, it wasn't. I recall one evening when Bob and I were walking down the
                    street, hand in hand, and a little boy came running up to us and said, “Do you
                    want to get married?” (They had marriage mills along the streets). We said, “No,
                    we are already married.” Then he asked, “Do you want to get divorced?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us about Bob's work at the consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Some interesting things happened. Once a phoney “America vice consul” set
                    up shop in Ensenada, south of Tijuana on the coast. He fooled everyone including
                    the police, and bought a car and other goods on credit from local merchants. Bob
                    was sent down to inform the Mexican authorities and assure them that the man was
                    not an American consular officer.</p>
                <p>Another time, Bob helped the U.S. Navy find a torpedo lost on the Baja California
                    coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, let's talk about your assignment to Beirut,
                        Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: When Bob received word that we would be going to Beirut, he was excited
                    because he was going to be doing something that had wanted to do for ages. An
                    Arabic class was about to begin and we had to be there in about three weeks. My
                    Dad had been living with us for two years and we had to find a place for him to
                    live. We sold our car and some of our furniture. It was quite stressful getting
                    everything done. We took a plane, and were off, arriving in Beirut on time for
                    the beginning classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had how may children at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We had four children. We loved Beirut from the start. The children went
                    to school and learned different languages. We celebrated our American holidays.
                    The highlight for the children was the 4th of July picnic at a nearby beach.
                    Their dad was dressed as a clown and they were very excited when they recognized
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want you tell the story of your evacuation because that
                        was a hair-raising experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: It was June when there were many bombings downtown. Everyone was getting
                    uptight. There was a good deal ofighting among the political rivals in the
                    country. There was talk of evacuation, and we wives really resisted the idea.
                    Some of us were pregnant and didn'know if we could come back.</p>
                <p>We made our final decision when the children couldn't to school anymore. There
                    were blockades in the streets, and they had to stay home. A nun who taught our
                    children at the Italian Girls School had a narrow escape downtown. A bomb went
                    off and she was hurled to the street. Someone stole her purse. She was so
                    frightened, she said she would never go out of the school again.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Social life was almost nonexistent, although now and then we attended dinner
                    parties in the less dangerous sections of town.</p>
                <p>Shortly after that, Bob came home and said he thought we would have to pack up
                    and leave.I remember thinking, “Oh no, I'll ride this out with Bob 'til the
                    bitter end.” Since we lived in a rather exclusive part of town, there wasn't a
                    lot of bombing or fighting in that area. We could look out over the balcony and
                    the Mediterranean. So we thought we would be safe.</p>
                <p>Bob left the final decision up to me. I finally agreed that it would be too
                    dangerous to stay. I remember packing the trunks with all our clothes.The kids
                    were looking forward to the trip as though it were a big, exciting
                    adventure.</p>
                <p>Just before we boarded the plane for Rome the next day, Bob chucked me under the
                    chin and said, “Now, Rita, it's all in how you look at it.” I didn't feel very
                    light-hearted about the whole thing and I was frightened. I had four children
                    and was expecting another one. I had just had a miscarriage before we left
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you stay in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We stayed at the Villa Eva. It was a little boarding house. They provided
                    us with rooms, bathrooms, and all the meals. The State Department paid for
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: We were there four months. In August, Bob got a flight on a military
                    place and came to see us. Then we went to Trieste where my very good friend
                    lived. She had been asking us to come and visit. She said it was really a shot
                    in the arm for her. Bob went back to Beirut. He wrote and said that was one of
                    the best vacations he could remember. So we really did — we tried to make the
                    best of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go back to Beirut, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG:We went back in October. We had already put the children in school in
                    Rome.I had made arrangementfor when I would have the baby in the hospital and
                    all that sort of thing. I had a terrible time getting back. They didn't want to
                    put me on a plane because I was so far pregnant. And in those days they didn't.
                    Finally, however, I was given permission to fly back.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I like to think of our homecoming. Of course, the house had been empty for four
                    months and Bob hired somebody to go over and clean everything. He had roses in
                    all the rooms, and champagne on ice in the fridge. We were very happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you, seven or eight months pregnant at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: There was a problem about my due date. They didn't know when I left
                    Beirut whether I was two or three months, or whether I was just started. One
                    doctor had said November, and one had said December — and the doctor in Rome
                    said January.</p>
                <p>Back in Beirut, I kept getting false alarms and Bob would rush me off to the
                    hospital. November; came and then it was December and still no baby. The doctor
                    then told me, “You choose your date.” So, I chose the day after Christmas. I had
                    a big party for our daughter's birthday the week before, and the day after
                    Christmas, Bob drove me over the hospital and the baby was induced.And you can't
                    imagine how they induced babies in those days. Do you want to find out?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: I had to gulp down a big glass of orange juice with a spoonful of castor
                    oil in it, and then I had to wait.</p>
                <p>Finally, I said, “OK.” I was placidly reading my book and the time had come. The
                    nurses rushed in and taking one look at me, one said , “You have your babies
                    very quickly, don't you?” I felt like saying, “Quickly? I've been waiting a long
                    time for this child and having false alarms.” They said, “Wait until you get
                    into the delivery room.” Now, how was I going to wait to get into the delivery
                    room?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the nurses, were they French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: I don't remember, but I do remember that it wasn't a very clean hospital.
                    A few days later, I remember that Bob drove up and it was time for us to come
                    home. We had this little bundle in a yellow blanket and all the kids wanted to
                    hold him. He was the little spoiled child.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Lebanese maids always spoiled the little baby boys. Isn't that
                    something? The old Arabic custom was that little boys are best, and believe me,
                    I saw it first-hand. In fact, there was one Lebanese woman at the hospital who
                    was having her baby and we heard she had a girl. The husband would not even come
                    to see her because he was so upset that it wasn't a boy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's that way in India, too. So how old was your baby when
                        you left Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: When we left Lebanon, Johnny was going on three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any more difficulties with the political
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: No. In fact, in most places you could hardly tell there had been a war
                    on. We were six flights up in an apartment building, and when Bob came back to
                    the apartment to get it cleaned, he found a spent bullet on his desk. That
                    bullet had come through the window six flights up, ricocheted through the slats
                    of the venetian blind and landed right where Bob always did his studying, so
                    that was about the only memento we had of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lucky, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Yes, we certainly were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, from there then you went to Washington and then to
                        Khartoum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Washington, was it easy to get back
                        into the swing of things in America, or had you found things had
                        changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: No, it was not easy. And I was so surprised. I thought, well I don't have
                    any status here as a Foreign Service wife. Bob did, but I lost mine. And I was
                    just a housewife in the neighborhood. I thought, “Here I am in a beautiful new,
                    split-level house; I have supermarkets and everything I need. Why do I feel so
                    unhappy?</p>
                <p>At first, I couldn't understand it. I felt terrible that I could be unhappy under
                    those circumstances. But I wonder if people realize that coming back is harder
                    than leaving.It must happen to other people.I'm sure it does.So, we made new
                    friends, explored historic places, visited the museums and art galleries and
                    became re-Americanized.</p>
                <p>Now and then, Bob would say that some of our old friends were back in Washington,
                    maybe posted here or passing through on home leave.I remember one woman saying,
                    “Oh, now that we're stationed here, I have to do all the diapers myself.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I guess I had an “attitude” at first. That was really hilarious, considering some
                    of the places I had lived in. But I had had a privileged position as the wife of
                    a Foreign Service Officer. We were here four years, and then Bob was transferred
                    to Khartoum, Sudan. The situation was unsettled there, so Bob was told not to
                    bring his family. After four months, the children were out of school, and we
                    could go over and join him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the children feel about leaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Leaving America? Oh, they thought it was a big lark. They were always
                    great. They thought it was a big adventure. Our oldest daughter stayed here and
                    finished her senior year in high school. She stayed with a family that were
                    friends of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:So how did Khartoum look when you got here? Any reactions
                        to Khartoum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Well, when we got to Khartoum, all we could see and feel was the
                    incredible heat and sand. There was sand everywhere. And the children, the boys
                    especially, ran from room to room in our great big house.Our oldest son, Bobby,
                    was happily finding some lizards to play with.</p>
                <p>While writing my book, I asked each of our five children for some input on their
                    memories oLife in the Foreign Service. When Bobby gave his input for my book, he
                    gave me pages and pages of tiny computerized text.He had paragraphs and
                    paragraphs on different things he remembered.And he said, “Mom, I've got about
                    twice this much in my brain that I could give you if you want it.”I said,
                    “Bobby, I'm supposed to get this book down from 60,000 words to 40,000. Khartoum
                    is almost all about you and I can't throw any of this stuff you gave me away,
                    because it's so good. It's so well written.” He waabout 9 years old when we
                    arrived and 11 when we left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a good time with your family together once
                        again. The political situation was calm there? No problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: It hadn't been calm. In fact the airport had been closed for a while
                    before we got there. And I think there was a lot of trouble after we left. There
                    were some rather violent street demonstrations while we were there.</p>
                <p>But I was never worried when I drove my car downtown. Actually the main thing I
                    had to worry about when I first got there was to be sure that I drove on the
                    left side of the road.Once, I forgot that very important little requirement, but
                    fortunately nothing happened.</p>

                        There's a particular story I'm trying to remember about a trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: The safari?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, why don't you tell that one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG:It was a safari to Dinder (southern Sudan). We had some friends who were
                    going to Dinder and they asked if we'd like to go along.Michael (our Dinka
                    houseboy — he was a real treasure) said he would do all the cooking. An elderly
                    woman relative of his came in to babysit while we were gone.</p>
                <p>We traveled to Dinder on a train.Everything was so dirty in there. I just love
                    good, fresh water, but there was little at the camp.I never did find out where
                    they got their water. I think they had to dig and find little springs or
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody get sick on that safari?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Some boys got sick that first night. We were there about three days and
                    we ate in a big, covered mess tent. We just had spaghetti, spaghetti, and
                    spaghetti. Finally we said, “Where in the world is the meat?”</p>
                <p>One of the guides shot a femalantelope. He had not realized it was a doe, and was
                    desperate to get some meat for all these people. We were spending money like
                    crazy and not getting any antelope to eat.</p>
                <p>After he'd shot the doe, he looked off in the woods and saw two little fawns.
                    Without the nursing mother those little fawns would die. He felt terrible.He
                    didn't tell any of this story until after we had eaten. For about two days we
                    gorged on this wonderful antelope.He said he couldn't eat it and he was
                    practically in tears when he told us the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But any other exciting adventures. Did you ever have any
                        difficult ambassadors' wives to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: No, not at any other posts except M�rida. think I went into that a little
                    bit in the book. The wife of the consul was a step above me, Bob was second man
                    at the consulate. She was from the south, and I think she still thought of
                    herself as a Southern belle. She knew I came from poor beginnings from a big
                    family in the Midwest.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I remember one day at a party when she mentioned in front of guests that I'd gone
                    into the Navy and had become a WAVE. She said, “My mother would have never
                    allowed me to do that.” I told her that we were two different generations, and
                    my mother's mother wouldn't have let her join either. The she added, “Good
                    cradle shows.”This was a direct hit at my humble beginnings and it hurt.</p>
                <p>I resolved them and there that never, if I were in that position, would I act
                    that way to anyone whose husband was on a lower rung than mine.</p>
                <p>When my husband was on a higher rung at another post, I tried to be doubly
                    courteous to wives, because I remembered some miserable times in M�rida. Of
                    course, you do have to put on a mask and play the part, and we both did. This
                    woman did some nice things, too. She wasn't an “old witch” or anything like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, were you sorry to leave the Foreign Service? Would you
                        have liked to continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Bob wanted to go back to school and get his Masters and Ph.D. in
                    Linguistics. When we came back here, he enrolled at Georgetown University. At
                    that time I was working at the Department of Social Services in Montgomery
                    County.</p>
                <p>Without my daughter Susan's help, I don't know how I would have ever done it.
                    (Our oldest daughter, Linda, was in college in Michigan.) Susan was here when
                    the other three children came home from school each afternoon.</p>
                <p>The change in my life was very hard. Before we left the Service, I had made the
                    mistake of wrapping up my whole identity in the role of a Foreign Service wife.
                    That, to me, was something no one else that I knew, had ever even come close to
                    doing. I thought at the time, that my sisters might think, “Oh Rita, she thinks
                    she's quite important since she is a Foreign Service wife.” So there was a big
                    change in status.</p>
                <p>I really loved the Foreign Service. But a wife should have an identity of her
                    own. She shouldn't have to rely on her husband's career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't until after you left the Foreign Service that
                        you started your own career.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYSONG: Yes. Bob went to school and I worked. It was hard but the work was
                    satisfying for me. After Bob graduated, he also took a job with county
                    government.Both of us continued with our jobs until we reached retirement
                    age.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I next took a journalism course in a local college. I
                        interviewed and wrote about senior citizens in the county for a weekly
                        newspaper column. But the work involved in writing my book was most
                        satisfying of all. I may write another one — possibly about a little boy's
                        adventures in Africa, based on Bobby's experiences.</hi>
