                <p>AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. SMITH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 28, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, how did you become interested in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I suppose that goes back to my youth, when I was a young Marine. I
                    enlisted in the Marine Corps right out of high school and served three years,
                    the first time, as an enlisted man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Just after the end of World War II. I wound up visiting a whole lot of
                    places in the Far East. I was stationed for two years at Subic Bay, the naval
                    operating base in the Philippines. And I guess that's what turned me on to
                    living and working abroad and other cultures and other peoples. And I'd always
                    been interested in government, political science, and history.</p>
                <p>So I came back and started college. I went to Texas Christian University in Fort
                    Worth. Fortunately, about halfway through my freshman year they came up with a
                    new inter-disciplinary studies program called International Affairs. That was
                    just what the doctor ordered and I changed my major to that. I must say that I
                    never regretted it. On the other hand, six months later I went back into the
                    Marines because the Korean War broke out. I did two more years and was
                    commissioned and wound up with the 1st Marine Division in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get in the wrong place at the wrong time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was not wounded, I'm happy to say. As a Marine second lieutenant, an
                    infantry lieutenant, I'm very glad to have survived that. When I came back, I
                    finished school, but I seemed always to be pointing toward the Foreign Service
                    for some reason. In my junior year I took the written exam, which was awful in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was for the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: The Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the three-and-a-half day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am also a veteran of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I remember having to drive to Dallas and taking that ghastly exam and
                    watching the others in the room. We may have started out with 30 or 40 people.
                    At each break point in those three days, whether it was lunch or the afternoon,
                    five or six would drop out. [Laughs] By the time the last day had rolled around,
                    I knew I had failed because there were whole pages of questions I couldn't
                    answer and I just had to leave them blank. But I stuck to it and managed to
                    pass.</p>
                <p>Those were the McCarthy days, of course, so my appointment didn't come through
                    until a year or more later. I managed to stay on and finish my master's degree
                    before I was appointed. And then the old story. Having waited for a
                    year-and-a-half for word to come back to take my oral examination, I flew back
                    to Washington on short notice and did that. Again, I was sure I had failed, but
                    I didn't. I then went back to Fort Worth and within six weeks I got a frantic
                    telegram or phone call, I've forgotten which, saying, “Can you report next
                    week?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably it was a telephone call. I got the same
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In March of 1955, Eisenhower's first administration, I packed up my wife
                    and moved back to Washington, where the reception was sort of, “What? Are you
                    here already?” I was assigned to the old News Division, run then by Lincoln
                    White, a fabled spokesman and one of my heroes. So instead of going into any
                    kind of training, I went right to work as a press officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went in in March of 1955 and the first class to be put
                        together was in July of 1955. I know because I was in that class. Before
                        that you were all being used sort of ala infantry replacements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The few people that were coming in were just being thrown
                        into the breach.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SMITH: Right. I was in that job and I loved it. It was a marvelous introduction
                    to the Foreign Service for a young FSO. It was a great assignment. I was there
                    less than two years, about 18 months, I think, before I was assigned abroad. And
                    then I went to some sort of course. Joe Montllor and Jan Nadleman ran it, but it
                    was somewhat abbreviated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They were running the basic officers' training
                        course. I think it was just two months, but those two were running it at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: You remember those names?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And then we went off to Lahore, Pakistan, where I was assigned as vice
                    consul and chief of the one-man consular section. I don't know whether you just
                    want a stream of consciousness thing or something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not really. You can refer back to, maybe, lessons learned,
                        but I would like to concentrate on your African experience here. But before
                        I do that, you served in Lahore as consular officer from 1956 to 1958, and
                        then Beirut from 1959 to 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Foreign Service by that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it was very favorable, indeed. I thoroughly enjoyed that first
                    assignment. I continue to believe that every FSO should be assigned, if not on
                    his first assignment, then very early on, to a consular job of some sort. I
                    really think that's part and parcel of the Foreign Service and a terribly
                    important part.</p>
                <p>So I enjoyed that first assignment in the consular section. I had everything from
                    passports to visas to protection of American citizens. In fact, I had a young
                    American woman raped who was driving overland from Kabul into Peshawar. She was
                    raped by a Greek driver she had hired in Tehran to drive her on the journey.
                    Incredible. Things that were all good training for what lay ahead. So my
                    reaction to the Foreign Service was very positive, indeed. And it continued.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I went from Lahore, actually, to French language training in Nice for three
                    months, then to Beirut, where I was assigned, initially, as an economic officer.
                    I had had great bosses in Lahore. Both Ernie Fisk and Andy Corry, my consuls
                    general, were regarded as characters in the Foreign Service, but I learned a
                    great deal from them.</p>
                <p>Ernie Fisk was an old newspaper man and Andy Corry was really a political
                    appointee. He was a former minerals attach� in New Delhi and a prot�g� of
                    Senator Mike Mansfield because he was from Montana. And he used to teach the
                    classics at the University of Montana. He was a Ph.D. and very well educated,
                    almost too much so at times because he was given to telling jokes at staff
                    meetings in Latin and not understanding why we weren't all roaring with
                    laughter. But I had good bosses there.</p>
                <p>Then in Beirut, initially as economic officer, and then as political officer,
                    under Ambassador Robert McClintock who, again, was one of the outstanding senior
                    officers in the Foreign Service. He was then on his third or fourth
                    ambassadorship. Tough but marvelous to work for. After a year he shifted me to
                    the political section in Beirut which, of course, in that part of the world is
                    fascinating. I enjoyed the work in Beirut enormously. But by this time we had
                    two children, and we didn't really enjoy apartment living in Beirut.</p>
                <p>And to be honest, I was not that enamored of the Arab world. Two things happened
                    simultaneously. The Department came out with a notice—this would have been 1961,
                    I suppose—that they were going to mount the African Field Seminar and take a
                    group of young and middle-grade foreign service officers on a six-week tour
                    through Africa, and they were asking for volunteers for this. Simultaneously,
                    the Department asked me if I would like to round trip to Beirut and enter the
                    Arabic studies program, full-time specialization in Arabic. And I did not want
                    Arabic specialization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I ask what didn't you like about the Arab world? It's
                        an acquired taste.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It is, indeed, and I hate to let my prejudices show. If I'm honest with
                    myself, I suppose I would have to attribute it to prejudice of some sort. We had
                    a number of Lebanese friends, obviously. But I must say, in all honesty, I never
                    made the kind of lasting friendships among my Arab colleagues and friends that I
                    did in virtually every other post in the world, certainly including the African
                    post. I simply didn't enjoy the Middle East.</p>
                <p>And the Lebanese, of course, are unique. While their politics may be fascinating,
                    perhaps the Machiavellian aspects of it didn't turn me on too much. I really
                    can't answer that, Stu. I don't know why. It's simply, as you say, an acquired
                    taste that I didn't acquire. Now many of my friends there did. Dick Murphy was
                    in the Arabic studies program there. We later visited Dick and Ann when they
                    went to Aleppo as vice consul. And we had many friends that remained in the
                    Arabic studies program, but it didn't turn me on.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made a conscious decision that this was not for you? I
                        mean, it was offered to you and you said, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1961 I was in INR dealing with Africa at the time,
                        myself. And this was almost the year of the discovery of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. Precisely.</p>
                <p>The Kennedy Administration was in and this was a place where they felt they could
                    shine. New countries were coming in and we were very excited about Africa.</p>
                <p>And I saw, I suppose as a young officer, an opportunity to get in on the ground
                    floor, as it were. And I volunteered for that African Field Seminar and
                    volunteered for African area specialization, which involved not coming back to
                    Beirut, obviously, but rather a year's university work in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go on the Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe some of the people and the impressions
                        that you all had and any, you might say, lasting effects? This was a unique
                        experience, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a unique experience. I don't know that my group was the first; I
                    think we may have been the second. Our leader was an experienced FSO named
                    Curtis Strong. We must have had 15, perhaps 20, officers, most of them from
                    State. We had one or two from CIA, DOD, and USIA, and a few others.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We started in in Dakar, spent two weeks at the University of Dakar in Senegal.
                    You had to have French for this, obviously, because you were covering both
                    French and English speaking Africa. We spent two weeks in Dakar at the
                    university. And then, in a chartered old DC-3, we started zig-zagging our way
                    right across Africa—Bamako, Bobo Dioulasso in what was then Upper Volta,
                    Ouagadougou, Bangui, Abidjan, Lagos, Accra, all over the place. And in each
                    place the embassies certainly did their homework. We met, virtually in every
                    place, with the head of state, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and so
                    forth. Plus home entertainment, believe it or not, by Africans, civil servants,
                    professors, or doctors, lawyers, what have you. I found it a very, very exciting
                    trip, indeed. We then continued across Africa, winding up in Nairobi and
                    Kampala, and spending the last two weeks at Makerere College in Uganda with more
                    lectures and so forth, in English this time. It really turned me on. I
                    thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>The side benefit of that trip was that, while I was on it, it fell to my wife to
                    pack up our household effects and do all the nitty-gritty involving our
                    transfer. And then we came back to the states and I had a great year at
                    Northwestern University in the Africa Studies Program under Professor Melville
                    Herskovits, who was then and perhaps still is, posthumously, the granddaddy of
                    American Africanists/anthropologists. He had done his early field work in
                    Dahomey, now Benin, back in the early 1930s and had written book after book on
                    it. So sitting at his feet for nine months was the opportunity of a lifetime. I
                    didn't go for another master's degree there. I took what I wanted to take and
                    even audited some courses. I was able to really concentrate on Africa. There
                    were three of us assigned to that program. I don't know whether we're still
                    doing that or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't either. So some considerable care was taken to get
                        our young officers off to a right start at that time, rather than a
                        haphazard, you drift into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe this is, of course, an advantage of when something
                        springs up because our posts were really quite minimal until the
                        independence movement started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: But as you pointed out earlier, this was at the time of the burgeoning of
                    Africa. We were opening up new posts every day, opening new embassies,
                    consulates. And, indeed, my onward assignment from Northwestern couldn't have
                    been a better one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what that was and when it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SMITH: I finished the academic year 1961-1962 at Northwestern. I'll never forget
                    the phone call from Washington. Nigeria, of course, was the most exciting
                    country in Africa. Even then it was burgeoning. They had an astute prime
                    minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The President was Nnamdi Azikiwe. Both
                    loomed very large on the African scene. They were both well educated, terribly
                    articulate, bright, I would say brilliant men. And my onward assignment was to
                    open a new consulate in Eastern Nigeria in the provincial capital, Enugu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we want to open a consulate there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In those days there were three major regions in Nigeria, the Northern, the
                    Western, and the Eastern. We wisely, in my judgment, wanted a consulate in each
                    of those three major regions because of the sheer size, and diversity of the
                    country, and the terrible tribal divisions that were already coming into play.
                    The Eastern Region, Enugu, where I was, was dominated by the Ibo tribe, the
                    Western Region by the Yoruba, and the Northern Region by the Hausa/Fulani.</p>
                <p>So we had had a consulate in the North in Kaduna for some while, and Ibadan in
                    the West had been open, but it fell to me to open the new one in the Eastern
                    region. And I did so under a great country team in Lagos. Joseph Palmer II was
                    our ambassador, already the dean of the FSOs in Africa. He had already served as
                    principal officer in Salisbury and elsewhere in Africa in Nairobi. He was the
                    ambassador. Jerry Green was the deputy chief of mission. I couldn't have had a
                    better country team situation in Lagos. They gave me my head and said, “Bob, get
                    on over there and get it cranked up.” I did so and we loved it so much that we
                    extended our assignment there and went back for a third year. I think I would
                    have gone back beyond that had they permitted it, but they wanted me back in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your principal duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, my duties were the same as any other principal officer. I had only
                    one other substantive officer. I had a vice consul and two other American staff,
                    a secretary and an administrative assistant. There were a number of Americans in
                    Eastern Nigeria, many of them black Americans who had married Nigerians. We also
                    had a USIS officer there.</p>
                <p>In addition to the whole range of consular duties, politics in Nigeria were
                    absolutely fascinating. We were already starting to see the beginnings of the
                    terrible tribal divisions which later would almost tear the country apart. So to
                    a far greater extent than I anticipated as a consul in an outlying province, I
                    was doing a great deal of political and economic reporting. And it was all grist
                    for the mill, not only in the embassy in Lagos, but back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with which tribe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Ibos, who later were to establish Biafra, which touched off the civil
                    war. One of the things involved in the struggle was who was going to control the
                    federal government. There was always the competition as to which region had the
                    most people and every time they did a census they would suddenly discover whole
                    villages of 30,000 people that weren't there a few years earlier, and so forth.
                    There was a terrible rivalry of that sort. Each tribe felt put upon by the other
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>The Ibos, by general agreement, then and now, seem to be among the most
                    intelligent, hard working, articulate, outgoing people in Africa. That is a view
                    I continue to hold today, certainly in Nigeria. And they were overwhelmingly
                    Christian or animists, as were the Yorubas. But the Hausas, of course, were
                    Moslem and dominated the federal government in the presence of the prime
                    minister, even though an Ibo was president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fact that they were dominated, was this a policy on
                        the part of the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I think so. The more conservative Moslem north, I think, the British
                    felt more comfortable with. And, in fairness, they, in fact, did have the
                    predominant population; and, measured strictly on a population basis, probably
                    should have dominated the government. But their dominance was resented in the
                    southern parts of the country, particularly in the Eastern Region.</p>
                <p>But during my three years there, these divisions and rivalries were masked, so
                    much so that you could get in trouble with a Nigerian by asking him outright
                    what tribe he was from. He would bristle and say, “I'm a Nigerian.” Because
                    everyone was attaching so much importance to building one Nigeria, that was the
                    cry. Yet, underlying that, and when you'd get to know them really well, over a
                    beer at night I would get vitriolic comments from my Ibo friends about the North
                    or even the Yorubas in the West, and so forth, about how “We Ibos are put upon
                    and we're not getting our share of the federal pie.” So this was all coming into
                    play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would be reporting this back, but looking back on it,
                        was there any real American interest in this other than this is a
                        fascinating situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, yes, certainly. Nigeria was the largest country in Africa, with
                    enormous natural resources and human resources, as well. And also, of course, in
                    my region was the burgeoning oil industry down there. Shell/BP was already in
                    production in the Rivers Area of Eastern Nigeria and there were American
                    interests there already, to say nothing of Shell/BP. We had, clearly, American
                    interests and we, as a matter of policy from the very beginning, attached
                    ourselves to strong support of the one Nigeria concept. We did not want to see
                    Nigeria fall apart. We worked toward smoothing over some of these dissensions,
                    and calming these inflamed tempers, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, after all, here were are, a country four, or five,
                        or six thousand miles away, how could you, let's say, as a consul do
                        anything? I mean, were you getting instructions to do anything in this
                        nature or were you just playing a very passive role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think they left that largely to my own discretion. The major d�marches,
                    obviously, were being made by the ambassador and the DCM, who visited all the
                    consulates quite regularly. But because of the way the United States was
                    regarded and the enormous popularity of Jack Kennedy (indeed, I have seen
                    Kennedy's picture plastered up in mud huts all over Africa in those years), the
                    Nigerians loved Jack Kennedy and the United States. We also had a major aid
                    program going there. In the Eastern Region alone, I had over 200 American Peace
                    Corps volunteers scattered all over the region doing everything from
                    agricultural development, education, health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, of course, the birth of the Peace Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was it at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Enormously effective. And some of the Peace Corps volunteers, even to the
                    present, continue to correspond with Nigerian friends and to take their families
                    back to Nigeria to the village in which they worked as young people 25 years
                    ago. Very, very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a brand new program. Were you watching over this
                        thing with some apprehension of how it was going to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SMITH: No. I think I was caught up, perhaps one could call it naivete, but those
                    were very exciting days and Nigeria seemed to be doing it right. It was a truly
                    democratic nation. The vote was there and, despite the conflicts about the
                    population census and that sort of thing, it was truly democratic. There were
                    distinct major political parties, one of them dominated by the Eastern Region,
                    one by the West, another by the North. But they would fight these battles out at
                    the polls. There were always disputes over the election results, but the winner
                    won and that's simply the way it was. So we wanted to encourage this and to keep
                    going. We wanted to encourage Nigeria's development. We knew they were going to
                    walk across the African stage with long strides and we wanted to help them.</p>
                <p>But I can't emphasize strongly enough the close ties that we all felt in those
                    days between the United States and Nigeria. So much so that, when President
                    Kennedy was assassinated, I have never seen such an outpouring of affection and
                    genuine shock and distress in my life, before or since. A steady stream of
                    callers at my residence lasted virtually all night. I'm speaking of Nigerians
                    now, not just Americans or diplomatic and consular colleagues. The memorial
                    service I arranged in his memory was attended by the Governor of Eastern
                    Nigeria, Sir Francis Ibiam, a distinguished Presbyterian medical doctor and
                    later politician, by the Premier, and the entire cabinet. And for weeks
                    everything was concentrated on President Kennedy's assassination. It was as if
                    he was their president, as well. A terrible shock to them. So I felt very close
                    to them.</p>
                <p>When I left, I was reassigned to the Department. I had been abroad then for
                    almost ten years and they pulled me back to the Department, having me in mind
                    for the Nigeria desk. That was filled, initially, though, so I took the Ghana
                    desk for the first year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I came back in 1965 and from 1965 until 1966 I handled the Ghana desk. And
                    toward the end of 1966 things in Nigeria went from bad to worse. It fell to my
                    successor, Bob Barnard, to evacuate American citizens because of the war. There
                    were massacres of Ibos in the North. I mean real massacres, they were killed in
                    the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. 1965 and 1966. So the civil war broke out. The Eastern Region tried
                    to peel off, seceded from the Federation and declared itself the Republic of
                    Biafra. By this time Ambassador Palmer had come back as Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs, so I worked very closely with him during the war years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to come back to that but, first, why don't we
                        talk about the Ghana time. You were, again, dealing with Ghana at a
                        difficult time. Could you explain what our relations were in 1965 and 1966,
                        how you saw it from the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Before coming back and taking over the desk I drove overland from Enugu,
                    west to Lagos, and then all the way across the west coast into Accra for a
                    week's visit there with the embassy staff in Ghana. I'd been there before but
                    only briefly. We had a very fine staff there, one of whom, a junior political
                    officer on the staff then, is now our ambassador in Moscow, Jack Matlock. That
                    was where I first met Jack.</p>
                <p>Kwame Nkrumah was still in power in 1965. And to say that he was difficult for
                    the embassy and the United States Government would be the understatement of the
                    year. He seemed to be, at times, almost losing his mind. Ghana had been
                    left—Ghana was the first to come to independence—in really excellent shape by
                    the British—myths to the contrary notwithstanding. They had a very favorable
                    balance of payments. They had millions and millions in foreign reserves, hard
                    currency. And Nkrumah simply ran the country into the ground by his tortured
                    anti-Western, Socialistic, anti-capitalist attitudes.</p>
                <p>The strange thing about that initial visit to Ghana was, even though I was being
                    briefed on the idiosyncrasies of Nkrumah, at the same time individual Ghanaians,
                    even senior civil servants, to say nothing of the man on the street, couldn't
                    have been nicer or more blatantly pro-American to the extent of their saying at
                    times that, “You mustn't pay too much about what Osaygefo says.” Osaygefo was a
                    name he was called by the Ghanaian people. Ghanaians, perhaps second only to the
                    Ibos, from whom I had just come, are among the most likeable, pleasant, nice
                    people in all of Africa. They are simply an enormously likeable, warm, generous,
                    outgoing people. I can't find enough adjectives to use with respect to the
                    Ghanaians.</p>
                <p>It was tragic for us to sit back and see Nkrumah running this country into the
                    ground the way he did, and it was happening right before our eyes. When I went
                    there in 1965, there were still a number of hotels in downtown Accra that served
                    excellent meals. I remember having lunch on the patio of one of those hotels. By
                    the time I went back years later as ambassador, none of them could do that.
                    There was nothing to be had. There was nothing to eat, et cetera. And almost all
                    of it was attributed to Nkrumah's madness. I don't mean that literally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that there might be a mental problem
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think seriously, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SMITH: An attitude, yes. It was fascinating to deal with it. He was concentrating
                    on the urban areas. And this is an age-old story in Africa where African leaders
                    tend to concentrate on keeping their urban populations happy at the expense of
                    their rural populations. And Nkrumah did this with respect to his cocoa farmers,
                    cocoa being the largest source of foreign exchange. And as a result, they
                    couldn't get people to man to cocoa farms and the country just spun out of
                    control.</p>
                <p>So much so that, while I was on the Ghana desk nine or ten months later, they had
                    had enough and Nkrumah was overthrown in a coup. They did this in relatively
                    bloodless fashion. While Nkrumah was in the air flying to Red China, he was met
                    on the ground in Peking by his Chinese host and it fell to them to inform him
                    that he was no longer Head of State in the Republic of Ghana. So that was a
                    fascinating time in a fascinating country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our feeling one of passivity towards Nkrumah? I'm
                        talking about the time that you were dealing with it. Were we trying to say
                        enough is enough because the man was attacking us, at least verbally, all
                        the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He certainly was. We tried for years to get along with Nkrumah. We would
                    turn the other cheek at times and do everything we could to assuage his anger.
                    Nothing worked with him, however. And, again, while I was on the Desk, I think
                    Nkrumah dropped the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, in that he
                    published a new book called Neo-Colonialism. I've forgotten the subtitle, which
                    was simply outrageous. It accused the United States of every sin imaginable to
                    man. We were blamed for everything in the world.</p>
                <p>The book was so bad that I remember the then Assistant Secretary, G. Mennen
                    Williams, called me up and gave me that book and said, “Bob, I know this is bad.
                    I don't know how bad. I want you to take it home tonight and read it. You're not
                    going to get any sleep and I apologize for that, but on my desk, by eight
                    o'clock tomorrow morning, I've got to have a written summary of this because I
                    have called the Ghanaian ambassador in at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. We're
                    going to protest this book.” There had already been advance publicity so we knew
                    it was bad, but we hadn't had our hands on a copy. And it was everything we
                    feared it would be. It was awful.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>And the next morning—of course, he had me in on this meeting as the note taker—a
                    lovely, old man, Michael Ribiero, was the Ghanaian ambassador. Hated Nkrumah
                    privately, but was a good soldier trying to put the best face on this, a career
                    officer in their foreign service and very respected here and in Ghana. Governor
                    Williams, of course, was a relatively mild-mannered man. I had never heard Soapy
                    Williams raise his voice until that conversation. Neither have I ever heard an
                    ambassador get a tongue lashing like Ribiero got from Assistant Secretary
                    Williams that morning. He, unfortunately, tried a couple times to interrupt the
                    governor when he was making a point. He had my notes in front of him. And at one
                    point, when Ribiero interrupted him, said, “Just a minute, Mr. Ambassador, don't
                    interrupt me. I'm not through.” And he continued to go on. He was raising his
                    voice. He was shaking his finger in the ambassador's face. And it was a very
                    painful, hour-long interview. To put it mildly, he protested vigorously the
                    contents and publication of this book.</p>
                <p>I think the publication of that book might also have contributed in a material
                    way to his overthrow shortly thereafter. The Ghanaian people, as I say, did not
                    share Nkrumah's views on many things. The Ghanaians have always had a warm
                    relationship with the United States. Nkrumah simply, as the British say, went
                    round the bend and they got a belly full of it and booted him out of office.</p>
                <p>I also remember, the morning of the coup, I got the call about 2 a.m. here at the
                    house and went into the Department and immediately set up a little task force in
                    the Operations Center. Later in the same morning, about 8 or 8:30, Secretary
                    Rusk wandered down the hall and came in and said, “I've seen the early reports,
                    but I just want to hear it firsthand. What's going on in Ghana?” When I related
                    how Nkrumah had landed in Peking and had been informed by his Chinese hosts of
                    what had happened in Ghana, Dean Rusk broke into an ear-splitting grin. I've
                    never seen him look so happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enough was enough, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Enough was enough, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, this is an unclassified interview, and I know
                        there's been accusations. I think, actually, while you were in Ghana they
                        came out to the fore again that the CIA had been involved. Did you have any
                        feel towards that while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. We had been accused of that all along. There was nothing to it. I
                    mean, it was obvious that we were not among his legions of supporters, but
                    neither were we involved because there was no reason to be involved. The
                    Ghanaian military were quite capable of dealing with this on their own, as they
                    did. Unfortunately, the government that followed was, in its own way, almost as
                    bad as Nkrumah's. We had high hopes for it, but it didn't materialize.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>In just a few years that civilian, truly democratic government, elected in a free
                    election, was itself overthrown by the military because they hadn't been able to
                    correct the economic imbalances and so forth, and there was corruption, which
                    just seemed to be endemic. So Ghana then went on without any direct involvement
                    on my part until I later went back as ambassador years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's move on to Nigeria. You became the head of the
                        Nigerian Desk in 1966. For somebody who was looking at this record, what
                        does it mean to be the head of a desk or a desk officer for Nigeria, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think, perhaps, the simplest way of putting this is that the State
                    Department desk officer for any given country is the point man for that country
                    within the United States Government. And any questions, almost without
                    exception, having to do with that country, that desk officer, if he doesn't have
                    the answer, is supposed to be able to put his finger on it right away. He is the
                    action officer on the incoming telegrams from that post and is expected to know
                    a great deal about the country.</p>
                <p>Ideally, he will, of course, have served in that country. So I was in an ideal
                    situation, having just finished three years in Nigeria. I was also blessed by
                    the fact that Governor Williams had been replaced by Joseph Palmer as Assistant
                    Secretary, with whom I had a very close personal relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who had been ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And who had been ambassador in Nigeria for four years. So the war came as
                    a terrible, personal blow both to Assistant Secretary Palmer and to me because
                    we had so thoroughly enjoyed our service in Nigeria, and we were so fond of the
                    Nigerian people. Conscious as we were of the tribal problems which rent the
                    country apart, we were very sad to have it happen. In my own personal case, and
                    I guess Foreign Service Officers have this kind of problem from time to time, I
                    was in personal agony because my heart was pulling me in one direction in that
                    my personal friends, my closest friends, in Nigeria, were all rebels overnight.
                    They called themselves Biafrans. And very dear friends, my children's teachers,
                    the entire cabinet of Premier Okpara, and so forth, and many of the army
                    officers that I knew were suddenly rebels.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Instinctively, therefore, in my heart I had a certain latent sympathy for them
                    because I knew what they had gone through the last few years. I knew how
                    mistreated they felt, how put upon. So I couldn't avoid a personal feeling of
                    sympathy. And yet, our policy, which I must say, I helped formulate and adhere
                    to over those years, was one of clear-cut support for the federal government. We
                    felt very strongly that the worst things that could happen was to see Nigeria
                    torn apart. Had that happened, I think we would have seen a real domino effect
                    in Africa in that there isn't a single country in Black Africa that doesn't have
                    similar tribal divisions. If you once start down the road of tribes being able
                    to secede from the national government, it would be utter chaos and you'd have a
                    Balkanization such as the world has never seen before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'd already been facing this problem in the Congo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, that's true. And we had a similar policy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the Congo example was very much before
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember Congo being much of an example. I'm sure it may have been
                    in the back of our minds. On the other hand, and, again, I will confess to some
                    prejudice here, the Nigerians were simply a great deal more civilized. When the
                    Belgians left Kinshasa, there wasn't a single graduate engineer in the country.
                    Nigeria was full of Rhodes Scholars, engineers, doctors, lawyers. The British,
                    in short, did a much better job, so we had higher expectations for Nigeria, much
                    higher. But I had this ambivalence in that I was sympathetic to the Biafrans on
                    the one hand, but our policy was to support to the federal government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a bit about this. All of a sudden all hell was
                        breaking loose in Nigeria. How did policy develop? I mean, all of a sudden
                        did everyone say, “Okay, let's sit down. We've got to have a policy.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. I think it was not a question so much of formulating a new policy as
                    continuing the old one. We have always taken the position that tribalism was one
                    of the problems and that African states must have a strong central government
                    and they must have a feeling of oneness, of unity. We had contributed to this
                    all the time. When the secession came, we had strongly advised the Ibos not to
                    go down this road.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I think, in their heart of hearts, they really felt that we would support them.
                    They felt so close to us. The Ibos, I think, more than other tribes in Nigeria,
                    felt close to Americans. They fancied themselves like Americans in their
                    attitude toward work, and their gregariousness, and so forth. I think it came as
                    a real shock to many of them that we did not support them. Now mind you, many
                    private Americans did. Indeed, one of the most painful mornings I spent during
                    those early years of the Biafra War was one Saturday morning when Joe Palmer and
                    I drove out to Senator Kennedy's residence in McLean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Robert Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, Teddy Kennedy. We briefed him on the war and our policy there. Senator
                    Kennedy made no bones about his sympathies lying with the Biafrans because the
                    Biafrans had mounted an enormous and very successful propaganda campaign about
                    their suffering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you went to see Senator Teddy Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I should back up by mentioning how successful the Biafran, or Ibo,
                    propaganda campaign was. I hadn't, at that point, seen anything quite equal to
                    it except, possibly, the Israelis. They managed to get cover stories in Time, in
                    Newsweek, Life, with the cry of “genocide,” that these horrible northern Moslems
                    in Nigeria were trying, literally, to wipe out the Ibos as a people, all eight
                    or ten million of them, however many there were. This was not true. We never
                    thought it was true. Ambassador Palmer, of course, knew Balewa, Azikiwe, and the
                    others much better than I did. And later, when Balewa was assassinated, General
                    Gowon became the Head of State. He was a hymn-singing, practicing Methodist,
                    although from one of the small Northern tribes, not the major tribes. We never
                    really thought for a minute that genocide was the intention of anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question that there was a hint of in what you
                        are saying. Do you think that there was a parallel between this and, you
                        might say, the media looking at the problem of Israel? In other words, here
                        is an outgoing people and here are these Moslems. Maybe it wasn't the
                        Israeli lobby, but the supporters of Israel saw a parallel here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if you let one go, the other might go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. The Ibos, with great pride, called themselves in those years,
                    “the Israelis of Africa.” They milked that for all it was worth.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is much of the reason for the success of
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Yes. They raised enormous amounts of money here and in Israel, and
                    elsewhere. The Israelis flew in military equipment, and so forth. Several other
                    states did, too, the French and others. In short, the Biafrans almost succeeded,
                    especially, in Britain because of their British ties, but elsewhere in Western
                    Europe, and in Israel, and in the United States. They developed an enormous
                    reservoir of good will and support. Our policy was not to do that, of course. So
                    this became very awkward for us.</p>
                <p>Also, because the Ibos are so Christian, they managed to enlist the support of
                    Catholic Relief Services. The major hierarchy of the Catholic Church here was
                    strongly supportive of Biafra. That, of course, impacted on Senator Kennedy.
                    They also enlisted the support of the World Council of Churches, and the
                    American Jewish Committee. And I can best illustrate the point by relating that
                    Catholic Relief Services, the World Council of Churches, and the American Jewish
                    Committee, and several other religious organizations all got together and
                    demanded a meeting with Secretary Rusk on the Biafran War, demanding that we
                    change our policy and stop the “genocide” going on in Biafra.</p>
                <p>So I arranged this meeting. Assistant Secretary Palmer and I accompanied the
                    Secretary. And for an hour or an hour-and-a-half, these distinguished religious
                    leaders of all the major faiths were ripping into Secretary Rusk, whom we had
                    prepared, obviously, as best we could, to answer these questions. And I must
                    say, the Secretary responded beautifully, keeping his eye on the U.S. interests
                    down the road. “We didn't want to see the country fall apart and, indeed, we did
                    not believe for a minute the charge of genocide. Any civil war is horrible,
                    brother against brother, et cetera, et cetera.” And the Secretary handled this
                    beautifully. But I don't think we satisfied these gentlemen.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget what happened then. The meeting broke up and we saw the
                    religious leaders out the door. We left the conference room and started walking
                    down the hall. I was sort of lagging behind the Secretary and Ambassador Palmer.
                    I remember Mr. Rusk put his arm around Joe's shoulder and looked at him as they
                    were striding down the hall, and he said, “Joe, congratulations.” He said,
                    “You've succeeded in getting the Catholics and the Jews and the Protestants all
                    mad at us at the same time. What do you do in your spare time?” And he laughed.
                    [Laughs] These were difficult times, and we needed to keep our sense of
                    humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after all, when you look at it, we have a policy
                        that makes sense, but Nigeria, or even Africa, is not at the top of our
                        plate or what have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, but Nigeria was at the top of our African plate.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time, looking at it at as a practical measure,
                        one can say that, in the Middle East, Israel is a political entity because
                        of support within the United States, rather than looking at it as in our
                        real strategic interests. I mean, there's a strong case to be made there.
                        But because of political pressure we give it our unqualified support. Now
                        here you have almost the same pressures, albeit not over a long period of
                        time, but rising up. The State Department and the Administration often gives
                        in to expediency, particularly, political expediency. Why didn't we give in
                        on this one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I take great pride in that. I think I helped contribute to it
                    because I know Ambassador Palmer would often refer to me as illustrating his
                    point that, however sympathetic we might be to Biafrans on a personal basis,
                    here is my desk officer who lived there for three years and knows them
                    intimately, but even he understands that we can't let the secession succeed, not
                    that we would lift a finger militarily to prevent it. We had a very firm policy
                    of providing neither arms nor ammunition to either side in this dispute.
                    Unfortunately, a lot of the other countries didn't follow this, so they were
                    getting arms from the Soviets and some of the NATO countries, as well.</p>
                <p>I would also attribute it to what I have already referred to, and that is the
                    enormous success of the Biafrans' public relations effort. It was skillfully
                    done. They retained high powered firms both in California and New York, and
                    there was a steady drumbeat in the press. But I think, certainly, Ambassador
                    Palmer, and the Secretary, and the President never wavered in their support.
                    Indeed, one of the first national decision memoranda put before the new
                    President Nixon was on the Biafran War. Nixon, too, came down firmly on the side
                    of maintaining our policy.</p>
                <p>But you are quite right, we were under enormous domestic political pressure. I
                    will not identify this congressman, but I got an angry phone call one day from a
                    congressman who demanded that we change our policy. I explained as best I could
                    why we could not. I got a call from some Jewish leaders in New York who demanded
                    the same thing. I had to refuse, there was just no way, this policy was firm and
                    fixed. He said, “Well, I think you're going to be hearing from some of our
                    friends on Capitol Hill.” And within a week, the Department was inundated with
                    irate telegrams, letters, and so forth, from representatives and senators on
                    this.</p>
                <p>Some of them, otherwise intelligent men and women, would have gotten us involved
                    militarily, I'm sorry to say. Some U.S. senators, and I won't identify them,
                    were actually pressuring us to use U.S. Air Force transport aircraft to drop
                    food, supplies, and equipment behind the front lines into Biafra. And, of
                    course, we kept refusing.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Going back to my personal agony on this, to reflect our support of the federal
                    government, we would not receive or meet with Biafran officials. We didn't
                    recognize it as an independent country. They built a clandestine air strip in
                    Eastern Nigeria and managed to fly out on these various fund raising missions,
                    and so forth. I remember on one occasion Sir Francis Ibiam, himself, the
                    Governor of Eastern Nigeria, got to the States, got to Washington and asked to
                    see me. What to do? Ambassador Palmer said, “Bob, there's no way you can receive
                    him in the Department.” And I said, “Well, right. But we need to know what he
                    has to say.”</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, I found myself, literally, climbing up the backstairs
                    of a Washington Hotel to a virtually clandestine meeting with the distinguished
                    Sir Francis Ibiam, the Governor. And it was painful because he said, literally,
                    “Bob, you know us. How can you let this happen to us? They're killing my
                    people.” So it was a difficult time for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the war was over or had you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. And it ended in the way that we anticipated. That is to say, the
                    federal government finally prevailed and crushed the secession. But what made us
                    happiest was not that so much as the way they handled the defeated Eastern
                    Region. Like Lincoln, they were very generous in their victory. There was no
                    genocide or anything approaching that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this surprised so many of us because we had been
                        hearing the drumbeats, and all this, and thought, “Oh, my God, here it
                        comes.” And it didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Never happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which shows that you all knew what you were talking
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It made honest men out of us. And I must say, it was a sigh of relief, in
                    a way. Ambassador Palmer and I went out to Nigeria several times during the war,
                    of course, and we would meet with General Gowon in Lagos. I had great confidence
                    in him. I still think it was tragic that he was later assassinated. He was one
                    of those military leaders who was genuinely skilled in the art of governments,
                    which is a rare thing, I think, in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your time on the desk you dealt with both Governor
                        Mennen Williams, Soapy Williams, and with Joseph Palmer. I wonder if you
                        could do a little of, as we used to say in school, compare and contrast
                        their styles, and interest, and the way they dealt with matters in the
                        Department, as you saw it from your point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SMITH: I admired both men enormously. Governor Williams, of course, came out of
                    the American domestic political scene, a very popular four-term governor in
                    Michigan. And I think what impressed many of us, as you may recall, was that
                    President Kennedy appointed Soapy Williams as Assistant Secretary for Africa
                    before he appointed Secretary Rusk, attaching, thereby, the importance to the
                    job that Kennedy felt. And Soapy certainly shared that. He was genuinely
                    interested in Africa. He was an indefatigable traveler, like a politician must
                    be. He was a very fine listener, and so forth. I don't think he was an
                    intellectual heavyweight, but he was bright. And he, above all, knew to listen
                    to his people. I think there was some naivete on Soapy William's part in that he
                    expected too much too soon from Africa and was, I think, disappointed, as he
                    was, of course, with Nkrumah, in the case of Ghana.</p>
                <p>Joseph Palmer, on the other hand, brought to the job 20 to 25 years experience in
                    Africa and elsewhere. He was a consummate professional foreign service officer.
                    He was very, very bright, out of Harvard, was a very polished, intelligent,
                    hard-working diplomat and knew Africa very well. He was cautious, conservative
                    in his approach.</p>
                <p>I didn't mention this before and I was very negligent not to have done so. We had
                    a very fine professional in Lagos who replaced Ambassador Palmer there in the
                    form of Elbert G. Matthews as ambassador. He was another seasoned professional.
                    He'd been ambassador to Liberia before and knew Africa very well. He was a
                    strong supporter of the federal government.</p>
                <p>I guess I had a closer, personal relationship, for obvious reasons, with
                    Ambassador Palmer. And, of course, then we were dealing with a crisis
                    situation—12, 15 hour days. Many times Ambassador Palmer and I would be there
                    until 10 o'clock at night, getting instructions out to the embassy, or something
                    of that sort. I liked them both and they were both very effective in the job,
                    very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking from a somewhat removed perspective, not having
                        dealt with African affairs, but the impression of many of the people in the
                        foreign service was that Mennen Williams was a man whose heart was in the
                        right place, but you mention this naivete, that it was hard to report from
                        some posts in Africa if you said, you know, this country is falling apart,
                        or this is a lousy leader, or something like this. He didn't want to hear
                        this, particularly, if we were talking about native leaders. There was a
                        certain amount of caution in how one reported because of this advocacy of
                        the new independence movements in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there may be something to that. I have no direct experience of that
                    because I was in a consulate, reporting through the embassy, most of the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in a successful area, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Nigeria was successful. Certainly, there was nothing like that under
                    Ambassador Palmer. With Williams I would simply leave it with naivete. I think
                    his heart certainly was in the right place, but he expected rather too much, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he reflected how many people in the United States
                        felt. Certainly, you might say the liberal wing, and I include myself in
                        this, wished Africa all the best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Indeed, we all did. Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move on. You then went from this rather
                        agonizing place to quite a different world, but at the same time, as
                        difficult a world, when you were assigned from 1970 to 1974 to South
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. My last year in Washington, after I closed out the Nigerian Desk, I
                    was a student at the National War College for a year. I was assigned from there
                    as deputy chief of mission and minister counselor in the embassy in Pretoria,
                    South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I ask just a little about the War College? Did you
                        find the War College a good year as far as professionally, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely delightful year. I learned a great deal but, most of all, it
                    was a delight to get out from under the pressure I had been working under for
                    the previous four years. I still refer to it as, perhaps, my favorite year in my
                    career. I didn't have to work nearly as hard.</p>
                <p>South Africa, again, was a choice assignment for me, particularly since the
                    ambassador, who was named just a few weeks before I was named, was a political
                    appointee with no Foreign Service experience whatever. I was, therefore, the
                    senior career State Department officer in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name was John Hurd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: John Hurd, from Texas. A delightful man, warm, generous, outgoing, but
                    with a considerable bit of naivete, both with respect to Africa and even,
                    indeed, the civil rights movement here in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SMITH: He had been Chairman of the Texas Republicans or Texas Republicans for
                    Nixon, I forget exactly. He always insisted he was not a heavy, major
                    contributor, but he was active in Republican politics in Laredo and San Antonio,
                    Texas, and it was, admittedly, a political assignment. But John Hurd was
                    enormously popular with the South Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say South Africans, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: With white South Africans. Your point is well taken. He was popular among
                    the embassy staff, too, in terms of John Hurd as a man, as an individual,
                    because he looked every inch of the American ambassador, tall, handsome,
                    distinguished, and without a mean bone in his body. He was just a warm, generous
                    guy.</p>
                <p>But in a way, I think he felt then, and perhaps he still feels now, that I pushed
                    him awfully hard a lot of the time to do things that were “nasty” as far as the
                    South African government was concerned. I had very strong views then and do now
                    about this institutionalized racism that permeates the scene out there.</p>
                <p>So those four years as DCM to John, in one way, were delightful in the sense of
                    our personal relationship and the beauty of the country and the people that we
                    liked, black and white. At the same time, it was a real strain because I was
                    always regarded by the South African government as the guy who the State
                    Department sent out to keep John Hurd from being John Hurd and letting his
                    normal instincts run; i.e, let the South Africans handle their own problem.
                    “It's an internal problem and why should we be butting into their business. We
                    wouldn't like it if they were butting into our business, et cetera, et cetera.”
                    And the whole human rights equation didn't loom that large in Ambassador Hurd's
                    mind. I say this, despite the way it may read, without any rancor whatever. He's
                    very conservative. But to me and, happily, to the overwhelmingly majority of my
                    embassy staff, the South African government was simply anathema in many
                    respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way, you can say, “Okay, but you represent the
                        United States Government's policy and, being the principal professional
                        there, you wouldn't be giving guidance or pushing according to your
                        predilections but more because this is American policy towards Africa and
                        such and so, and Mr. Ambassador, you should do such and so even if you don't
                        want to.” Did you feel, maybe, you were giving a little extra twist or
                        something because of how you felt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Perhaps at times I did. But on the other hand, our policy was all right.
                    Our policy was one of open condemnation of apartheid, even then and that was
                    during the Nixon years. There was no getting around that, but there are
                    different ways of looking at a policy and then implementing it on the ground, as
                    you very well know. Or you can wink and nod at a policy and simply not put your
                    back into it. I guess the basic difference between us is I really wanted to put
                    my back into it to a greater extent than the ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Having said that, it was under our regime, the Hurd-Smith regime in South Africa,
                    that the first black foreign service officer was appointed to our staff in the
                    embassy in Pretoria. He was a young economic officer named Jim Baker, no
                    relation to the current Secretary. While Ambassador Hurd made all the right
                    noises, he did have to swallow hard on this because I think he thought that was
                    really going too far and rubbing the white South African noses in it a bit,
                    whereas I didn't share that view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose initiative was this assignment made because,
                        obviously, it was a policy initiative? It was in the papers of the day. I
                        mean, it wasn't something that was unnoticed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I, privately, had been pushing it for some time and I think Assistant
                    Secretary David Newsom and Bev Carter, his principal deputy and later my
                    predecessor in Liberia, probably were instrumental in pushing that appointment
                    through. Mind you, not that there was vociferous opposition to it. I don't know
                    what John Hurd said privately on the telephone, perhaps, to someone back in
                    Washington, but he never really opposed us in any open fashion at all. He would
                    make veiled references to it to me, privately. He'd say, “Bob, is this really
                    necessary? And isn't he going to be ostracized?” He would come up with reasons.
                    “Where are we going to house him? Will he be able to go into the same restaurant
                    and eat with us?” I would have to keep reassuring him. So he was sort of dragged
                    into this a bit. He couldn't have been nicer to him when it happened.</p>
                <p>I don't mean to say for a minute that John Hurd is in any way, shape, or form a
                    racist or anything approaching that. It's just that one brings different
                    perspectives to this and he felt strongly that we shouldn't be pushing the south
                    Africans quite so hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To finish up on this, how did the Baker assignment work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It worked out very well. For one thing, the South African government
                    leaned over backwards to show us that they were not racist and that they did not
                    put American blacks in the same category with their own Africans. Therefore, he
                    was lionized. When Jim Baker arrived, this young officer, his picture was in
                    every paper in South Africa.</p>
                <p>I remember once when we went to lunch with the ambassador, Jim, and I, and our
                    political counselor and a few others, the maitre d' in this restaurant pointedly
                    ignored Ambassador Hurd and walked up to Jim Baker, this young black officer,
                    shook his hand, and gave him the seat of honor at the table, which gave us all a
                    roar, including Ambassador Hurd. The South Africans worked very hard to make it
                    work. This is not to say that there wasn't real pressure and strain on Jim, as
                    there has been on every black officer since.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask that. How did this work out
                        personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a great strain on him but he had the moxie to handle this, and the
                    intelligence, and the emotional stability. He handled it very well. He also,
                    obviously, provided another entree into the black community which, while we had
                    it before, we didn't have it to the same extent as we did with a black
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the 1970 to 1974 period. What were the
                        United States' concerns in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We had genuine human rights concerns there. Our concern was that the
                    country was going to explode some day unless they took their figurative foot off
                    the neck of the black man. A position, by the way, I still hold because I still
                    think we may have a blood bath in South Africa one of these days. And we did not
                    want to see that happen.</p>
                <p>In those early 1970s, I'm sorry to say, some senior South African officials, I
                    think, really thought that, if a race war were to actually occur in South
                    Africa, that we would come militarily to their rescue, that we could not stand
                    idly by and see white South Africans slaughtered in their beds by Africans. I
                    think only now are they beginning to realize that that was never the case, that
                    we would not lift a finger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a question that would come up and that you would
                        try to scotch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our military attach�s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The military attach�s, in those days, had very close relations with the
                    South African military. I don't think that's the case anymore. I think their
                    presence contributed to that feeling. Also, the fact that, for instance, the
                    head of the South African Navy and my ambassador, John Hurd, were tied up
                    alongside each other as Navy commanders during World War II at some point during
                    the war in the Atlantic someplace. The South Africans would keep reminding us
                    that they fought with us in several wars, that they were vehemently
                    anti-communist, and so forth. They made all the right noises.</p>
                <p>If you could leave the race question aside, which in my judgment, is absolutely
                    impossible, the South Africans would be the strongest allies we have anywhere in
                    the world, if you look at in those terms. But you can't put the race questions
                    aside, in my judgment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the communist menace was raised every
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this having any real effect on our policy? I mean,
                        were you getting concerns from Congress or from other American business
                        interests and all this saying, well, let's not push too hard because if we
                        do this the communists are going to take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I would have to say we got very little of that. On the other hand, we were
                    getting pressure from the liberal side in Congress, particularly members of the
                    Black Caucus who were critical that we were too close to the South Africans and
                    that we should take a tougher policy towards that country. Actually, it's
                    remarkable when one looks back on it.</p>
                <p>The last eight years our policy has been called constructive engagement. In point
                    of fact, I think that would be a fair characterization of the Nixon-Kissinger
                    policies in the early '70s because, when I look back on it, that's about what we
                    were doing. We were engaged and our leverage was then and is now quite limited.
                    But we felt that, by continuing to whittle away at them and hammer these points
                    home, we would slowly get them to come to their senses. But that was not to
                    happen and has not yet happened.</p>
                <p>They continue to think that American blacks are not blacks. They're colored, as
                    far as the white South African is concerned, because there's a mixture of white
                    and black. And, therefore, when we talk about their race problem, they simply
                    say, “Bob, you just don't understand blacks. You just don't understand.
                    Congressman Diggs is not black. Look at him. He's colored.” To them, that
                    changes the whole picture. It's really quite pathetic.</p>
                <p>I had discussions with Prime Minister Vorster and so many others. But we felt it
                    was sort of a one step forward, two step back thing, and that they would
                    continue to do outrageous things. Our closest white South African friends, of
                    course, tended to be in the progressive liberal community, people like Helen
                    Suzman and Lolin Eglin, who remain some of our closest friends today. And they
                    fought the good fight for a long time, but it's far from over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you had much relations with the Dutch
                        element?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. It was somewhat more strained. The current president, P. W. Botha, we
                    used to call “Guns” Botha because, in our day, he was the Minister of Defense.
                    Ambassador Hurd had him to the residence for dinner, as we tried to do with all
                    the cabinet. But the Afrikaner was always much more suspicious of us and of our
                    motives, particularly of me. There was less of that with Ambassador Hurd. They
                    genuinely liked Ambassador Hurd. But the career officers in the State
                    Department, they were quite suspicious of them. Too liberal, too protective of
                    black rights, et cetera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the black community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. That had been started even before I arrived but I certainly
                    intensified it. I had a terrific political section staff and we worked very hard
                    at it. We were somewhat circumscribed. There were certain places where you
                    couldn't go, or they couldn't go, and so forth, but yes, we would have lunches
                    and dinners. We had more success in that we could easily have, and did have, a
                    great number of functions with black South Africans. Where you got into trouble,
                    where you had to be very, very careful, was trying to mix them with white South
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>I remember once the Minister of Police Affairs had a suspicion that I was going
                    to have a black South African at our residence. He happened to be a very
                    distinguished doctor. And he asked me flat out before coming were there going to
                    be black South Africans there. I said, “Well, yes, Jimmy, there will be.” And he
                    said, “Aw, come on. I can't come, Bob. Don't do that to me. I can't come.”
                    Private Afrikaners would and there are a number of progressive, liberal
                    Afrikaners. They're not all Neanderthals by any means. But the government, the
                    ministers in particular, some of them were just beyond the pale. They just were
                    and are hopeless, some of them, and they wanted nothing to do with them.</p>
                <p>I think you'd have small successes in that I've had a number of Afrikaners, after
                    a mixed function at our home or one of the other embassy homes, come up to me
                    and say, “Bob, I want to thank you because this is the first time I have ever
                    eaten with a black man and talked with him as an equal. I want to thank you for
                    that.” But this is just such a small thing compared to the enormity of the
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American business community? This has
                        become such a focal point. This is the one place where we can sort of show
                        our policy by trying to get people to disinvest, American firms, from not
                        putting money into South African firms. Was this much of an element at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SMITH: With some exceptions, I think the average attitude of the American
                    business community in those years was, don't rock the boat, don't fiddle with
                    the status quo. I must say, in more recent years, I think they've become far
                    more enlightened. We were constantly pressuring them to do what they could to
                    upgrade the working conditions, salary, et cetera, of their black employees.
                    Many of them tried hard but I think most of that has happened in the last few
                    years.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Yes. We stay out of politics, don't talk to me about politics. So they
                    took sort of a standoff attitude. But we've leaned on them, I think, more
                    strongly in recent years with some success.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I got a phone call one Sunday morning from the Director General asking me
                    if I would like to go to Rwanda as ambassador. I said, “Of course, certainly.”
                    They said, “Okay. We'll put your name in the hopper.” Within a few weeks I got
                    another phone call saying, “No, no. You're not going to Rwanda, you're going to
                    Malta in Europe.” And it turned out that Henry Kissinger was in the middle of
                    that GLOP Program. What was it, global outreach or global outlook?</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, at any rate, when this came to him, he was then secretary, he looked
                    at my record and concluded, “Hey, Smith has been long enough in Africa. Let's
                    get him out of Africa for awhile.” So he switched me to Malta. A very happy
                    circumstance. I thoroughly enjoyed the two years in Malta.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: 1974 to 1976. A delightful, beautiful, little island. The best living
                    conditions I've had anywhere in the Foreign Service. Beautiful residence,
                    friendly, friendly people. Again, openly avowedly pro-Western and pro-American,
                    except for the government then in power. And Prime Minister Dom Mintoff was a
                    thorn in my side from the very beginning. He was at times anti-Western,
                    anti-British, anti-American, would not let the Sixth Fleet ships call in there
                    even for liberty, et cetera. And he maintained that posture throughout my
                    time.</p>

                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give an evaluation of him? I mean, sometimes
                        people do this because this is how they feel they're going to make their
                        political points.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think Dom Mintoff honestly saw himself in the role as a bridge builder
                    between East and West. I think he really thought that Malta, small as it is,
                    could best serve the interests of world peace by acting as a bridge between the
                    East and the West following a policy of strict neutrality. Therefore, while he
                    would not let the Sixth Fleet into Malta, neither would he let Soviet warships
                    into Malta. You know, a plague on both your houses.</p>
                <p>But in point of fact, he was a classic Fabian socialist out of the trade union
                    movement. He genuinely was anti-capitalist, virulently anti-Tory, in terms of
                    the British and, indeed, he later threw out the RAF and Royal Marines that were
                    there while we were there. I never really questioned his sincerity in all this.
                    It was unfortunate because I think the majority of the Maltese people did not
                    share his views on those subjects. But he was a very effective, strong,
                    political leader, domestically. He did a lot for the common man. And he kept
                    getting reelected until the last general election where his party was thrown
                    out.</p>
                <p>I think one of the best jobs in the Foreign Service right now would be the
                    American ambassador in Malta with a nationalist government in power. It would be
                    delightful because my good friends, who were then in opposition, are now in
                    government.</p>

                <p>SMITH: No, no.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Don't need it. We don't need it anymore because of Sicily, Italy, Greece,
                    and Spain. I don't think there's any thought of that at all. We would have
                    liked, and I tried hard, to get the Sixth Fleet liberty privileges there because
                    it's a delightful liberty spot. When the admiral commanding the Sixth Fleet
                    asked me out for a weekend at sea on the carrier Forrestal, Mintoff wouldn't
                    even let one of our helicopters come in to Malta, land, and pick me up. My
                    British colleague gave me a RAF helicopter to fly me to the carriers and back.
                    But that's water over the dam. It's a delightful little country and a delightful
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we have any particular interests there? Did we have
                        concerns, for example, that the Chinese were sending some people there and
                        Qadhafi was making noises?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH: The Chinese and the Libyans were both active there. My greatest concern
                    while I was there was the Libyans. I met Qadhafi on Malta, as a matter of fact,
                    when he came on a state visit. Yes, we were concerned that Mintoff would go too
                    far into that camp and he did for awhile until he pulled back. The Chinese
                    weren't that much of a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just more a ploy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. He delighted in playing East against West. His recurring theme with
                    me, personally, throughout my two-year tenure there, was, “Mr. Ambassador, I am
                    the only European head of government that has not had a visit from Henry
                    Kissinger.” And he pounded on me for two years to get Henry Kissinger to stop by
                    on a visit. He was getting no U.S. aid, of course. We don't give them any aid;
                    they don't really need it.</p>
                <p>Ironically enough, during the last few months of my tenure there, there was a
                    chiefs of mission conference in London which Secretary Kissinger attended and I
                    bearded him about that in Elliot Richardson's residence in London. Elliot was
                    then the ambassador there. I actually got Secretary Kissinger's agreement that
                    on his next trip, barring disaster of some sort, he would find some means of
                    touching down in Malta, if only to have lunch. Ironically enough, I was
                    transferred to Ghana before that ever happened. He never made it. Mintoff will
                    never forgive either one of us, I'm sure. He's an egomaniac. Mintoff thinks he
                    is one of the world's great leaders and he conducts himself that way,
                    unfortunately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, his posture was such to gain him some

                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And often to make life miserable for the superpowers, which the Maltese
                    did in one European conference after another. Malta would be the one country
                    objecting. They would get consensus on a course of action and suddenly the
                    Maltese representative would object and throw the whole thing out the window,
                    that sort of thing. So he succeeded, really, in getting everybody mad at
                    him.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Obviously, I was the low man on the totem pole in terms of our European

                    Hartman when I went out there—Art was then Assistant Secretary for Europe—he
                    said, “Quite frankly, Bob, the way we'll know that you're really doing your job
                    well is if we don't hear from you very often.” And I took that quite literally.
                    I didn't do nearly as much reporting there as I did at other posts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was on home leave after two years in Malta. I was in the West visiting
                    relatives. The Department tracked me down in a motel in Boulder, Colorado and it
                    was Bill Schaufele calling, who was then Assistant Secretary for Africa, saying,
                    “Bob, would you be interested in Ghana?” And oh, boy, would I. I loved Ghana
                    despite all the trauma. So I jumped at that and said, “Yes, go with it.” They
                    put my name forward and we went back to Malta to pack up. We only stayed there
                    another couple of months, I guess, before we left.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to Malta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To Malta, that's right, to say good-byes and so forth. So we went on to
                    Ghana. I was very, very glad to get back in Africa. I felt a little bit out of
                    it in Europe, frankly, delightful as it was from a physical standpoint. I went
                    on to Ghana and found that the country had just gone from bad to worse in the
                    intervening years since I had been there. Nothing in the stores; indeed, many of
                    them were boarded up. Only one operating restaurant worthy of the name in the
                    whole city of Accra, which is a very large city. The economy was in a
                    shambles.</p>
                <p>By the time I got there, of course, they had been through a number of coups and a
                    General Acheampong was the Head of State and Chairman of the Supreme Military
                    Council, a rather unprepossessing military type who was struggling along. But I
                    had so admired the Ghanaian people, and still do, because they had retained
                    their wit, and charm, and humor despite all the privations piled upon them. They
                    have, in short, been badly served by every government they've had since
                    Nkrumah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it somehow endemic within this charming people or is it
                        just fate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't know. It's difficult to answer because the Ghanaians, like the
                    Ibos, were among the best educated in Africa, again, a plethora of lawyers,
                    doctors, engineers, even scientists, and so forth, most of whom now are working
                    and living abroad. There may be some dribbling back now, but most of them got
                    out while they could, further running down the economy. Nkrumah quickly went
                    through the British reserves I alluded to earlier.</p>
                <p>Under the Acheampong regime, which was a military regime, I was greeted with open
                    arms, literally with open arms, most warmly, our relations with it were very
                    good. But corruption was rampant in the country, as it is in many places in
                    Africa. We had a modest AID and Peace Corps program there. And again, because of
                    the greed and the corruption, there were, not one, but two coups during my three
                    years stay in Ghana leading to still other military regimes, each one no better
                    than the last.</p>
                <p>As I say, even the civilian regimes have not been able to repair the damage and
                    really put the country back on its feet. The only hopeful sign I can point to is
                    that the current regime, headed by Jerry Rawlings, seems to have finally gotten
                    its act together, despite his early rhetoric of anti-Americanism, a la Nkrumah.
                    He has reached agreements with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
                    and the Ghanaian Cedi, the currency, is again worth something, I gather. He is
                    making it worthwhile to be a cocoa farmer again. He's making it easier for
                    foreign businessmen to do business there. And in short, this young ex-flight
                    lieutenant in the Ghanaian Air Force now seems to be doing a much better job
                    than he did at first.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Our relations have traditionally been warm and close. There were a number
                    of Americans living there, in fact. Huge numbers of Ghanaians had immigrated to
                    the United States either legally or illegally. Our policy was to try to help
                    Ghanaians do what they could to get the country back on its feet and make it
                    economically viable through our Peace Corps, and AID programs, and so forth. But
                    again, the needs were so great and our means were so limited there wasn't a
                    great deal we could do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing in AID at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Largely in agricultural development, economic development in general,
                    health, the Peace Corps, in education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you deal with the problem? You've got an AID
                        project and, obviously, this is, in one way, funneling equipment, or money,
                        or something to a place that is full of corruption. I mean, people must have
                        come up and said, “Look, we can't do this unless we pay off so and so.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Then we didn't do it. Then we just didn't do it. We monitored the AID
                    programs closely to prevent that sort of thing on a virtually daily basis. I
                    have no hesitancy in saying that none of our AID money was siphoned off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was it? I mean, if the atmosphere was
                        corrupt, how do you operate in those circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you operate through non-corrupt officials or you design the projects
                    in such a way so that it doesn't lend itself to that sort of thing. I think most
                    of the money was made off commercial enterprises, commercial deals, certainly
                    not our AID programs, perhaps with others. Difficult, difficult years, a
                    tragedy.</p>
                <p>I think our AID programs were making some impact in the short run. But if I take
                    the long view, if I go back to 1960-1961 and look at what I found in Africa then
                    and look at what I find in Africa today, I have got to be terribly depressed.
                    Our AID program has not really worked that well, in my judgment, in Africa or,
                    indeed, elsewhere in the world. The Ghanaian people are, in fact, worse off
                    today than they were at the time of independence. The same thing is true in many
                    other African states.</p>

                    they were not self-sustaining to a sufficient extent or self-perpetuating.</p>

                    sustainable over the long haul after the American technicians departed. Now
                    there are a lot of exceptions to that and there are a lot of projects operating
                    in Africa today, I'm sure, under purely African direction with no American
                    technician in sight. So I don't mean this to be a blanket condemnation, far from
                    it. But I have to say I'm terribly disappointed when I look at the status of
                    African countries and their peoples today from what I anticipated it would be
                    back in 1960 and 1961 because, given their human and natural resources, many of
                    these countries should be much further ahead. So I don't think Western aid
                    programs—I shouldn't even single out the West—aid programs, in general, have not
                    been nearly as effective as they should have been, sad to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, maybe there are certain things that aid can't do
                        unless there is the proper infrastructure to support it. I'm talking about
                        the human infrastructure to support it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, perhaps not. I'm reminded of a conversation I had with Premier Okpara
                    in Eastern Nigeria early on in the '60s, who was also the head of the political
                    party in Eastern Nigeria. I remember him slamming his big fist down on the table
                    once and saying, “Mr. Smith, please, no more feasibility studies. You send
                    people out and they do a study. Then three months later you send another team of
                    Americans out and they do a study of that study, all of which is designed to
                    come up with a feasibility study. You're studying us to death and nothing gets
                    done.” He was ranting and raving, but all in good fun. He was grinning as he was
                    saying this, but there was a barb in it because our AID programs were
                    excruciatingly slow and hemmed in with all sorts of bureaucratic restrictions
                    and caveats. It was a tremendous frustration to African leaders to deal with our
                    AID people.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I don't have the answers. I know now, in 1989, they're looking at the whole AID
                    program again. I think they've reached the same conclusion that I just
                    articulated; that it has not been as effective worldwide as we wanted it to be.
                    I think we bit off more than we could chew in many of these places. You can't
                    undo it. I'm not saying we did any damage, it's just that they were not
                    self-sustaining and viable in the long run, which is very sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned with Ghana as being an African leader?
                        Or by the time you got there, had Ghana's role become less important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Ghana, until recent years, certainly through the Nkrumah years, always had
                    a leadership role in Africa quite disproportionate to its relatively small size.
                    You have to give Nkrumah credit for that because they led the way to
                    independence. They were the first independent black Africans, other than Liberia
                    and Ethiopia. So they did have a major leadership role. Therefore, we paid a
                    great deal of attention to it even while I was there because their voice in the
                    councils of the OAU, Organization of African Unity, and others was quite loud
                    and often strident while Nkrumah was in power. So yes, they very definitely had
                    a leadership role and we took cognizance of that.</p>
                <p>Also, they had been blessed with an excellent foreign service and civil service
                    all these years who had managed to hang on and survive these various regimes
                    that were doing them such damage. And they've got tremendous human resources. If
                    we could get all the Ghanaians living abroad, especially in England and the
                    States, to go back and put their talents to use, they could turn it around in a
                    hurry. But you're going to have to have the right government in power to make
                    that happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of governments and power, when you were there you
                        said there were several coups. Could you describe what happened, and what
                        you saw and did, and what the embassy did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Strangely enough, and this is a source of great amusement with some of my
                    colleagues, I happened to be in the States, either on medical leave or
                    consultations, when both those coups happened. I got back on the first
                    commercial flight but I was not physically there for the coup. It had very
                    little impact on the embassy or the American population. This was an internal
                    squabble among the military in the case of Ghana, and having to do with corrupt
                    practices and not sharing the wealth with the right people. Each new man pledges
                    to correct these wrongs and it doesn't happen. Liberia was a very different
                    case. We should get to that in a moment, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems that you had in Ghana
                        that come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SMITH: No. No. It was a most enjoyable tour of duty except for the privations
                    being suffered by the Ghanaian people themselves. And, indeed, because of our
                    insistence that Peace Corps volunteers live as their indigenous counterparts
                    live, we had real food problems, almost amounting to malnutrition, among some of
                    our Peace Corps volunteers. We had to start shipping sardines and other canned
                    goods up country to some of our Peace Corps volunteers just to keep body and
                    soul together. Things were that bad in Ghana and that was a source of great
                    concern.</p>
                <p>But politically, no. Ghana, during my tenure there, was behaving itself on the
                    international scene and they didn't have the voice in international councils
                    that they once had. We had very friendly relations. It was just the frustration
                    of being unable to cut through the graft and corruption internally. Not that we
                    were affected by it, but it just prevented a lot from getting done. It prevented
                    American firms from coming in and investing there. The economy just kept going
                    downhill while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any pressure? While you were there the
                        Ford Administration went out and the Carter one came in with a new emphasis
                        on human rights and all that. Did this cause you any turnaround or
                        reactivate you on things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No turnaround, certainly. I welcomed this new thrust and it gave me a lot
                    of additional ammunition to use in various conversations with the head of state,
                    with the foreign minister, and other cabinet ministers who would give me a very
                    polite, even cordial, hearings and make all the right noises, but very little
                    real change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were we concerned about in the field
                        of human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In Ghana there were some political prisoners and that sort of thing. I
                    can't remember many others. Most of that came in the years in Liberia, as a
                    matter of fact. Why don't we go on to Liberia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Why don't we go on to Liberia. In a way, it's
                        rather remarkable in this day and age, where ambassadorial assignments are
                        getting scarcer and scarcer as far as professional officers, that you had
                        three. So many people have had distinguished careers and they are tossed a
                        year and a half in Rwanda or something like that to end off their career and
                        they're supposed to depart the scene as quietly as possible. And this was
                        your third ambassadorial assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I was very fortunate, indeed, and I think it was just the question
                    of, quite literally, being in the right place at the right time. First of all,
                    let me back up to Ghana just a minute. I forgot one major thing. I followed
                    Shirley Temple Black but there was about a six-month interregnum. We pulled Mrs.
                    Black out in anger when the Ghanaians, to show their displeasure over some
                    American policy—I forget now what it was—at the last minute would not let
                    Secretary Kissinger land in Ghana. So my marching orders in Ghana were to go
                    back in there and patch things up, which didn't take long because the Ghanaians
                    were already predisposed to resume friendly and close relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective had Mrs. Black been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Quite effective. She's not the dilettante that some, at least, would have
                    you think she is. She was popular, very popular not only among the Ghanaians,
                    but among our own embassy staff. And the fine DCM I inherited from Shirley was
                    very high on her. There are obvious limitations on any political appointee who
                    knows little or nothing about the foreign service. But Shirley was very, very
                    bright, and dedicated, and sincere. She had had experience at the UN Even if she
                    didn't, I'd have to give her very high marks. As a matter of fact, because she
                    then came out of Ghana and was made chief of protocol, she swore me in when I
                    went out there.</p>
                <p>To go back to Liberia, the shift over there was simply “good luck,” because Bev
                    Carter had left some time before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, he had been ambassador in Monrovia. And Liberia, like Ghana, is a
                    class two mission, or was a class two mission. I don't know whether you even use
                    the phrase anymore. And the Department and AF, the African Bureau, felt very
                    strongly they did not want a rookie ambassador in Liberia, but rather someone
                    who had had African ambassadorial experience. My number was just coming up. I
                    was then about two and a half years into my Ghana tour, so it worked out most
                    fortuitously.</p>
                <p>We went on to Liberia very happily. Very different from Ghana. To be blunt about
                    it, I never found the Liberians, with all their American ties, nearly as
                    charming as the Ghanaians or, indeed, the Ibos. This isn't to say I disliked the
                    country or the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it has that reputation. It seems like it always has
                        been the exception or the side show and something that is basically
                        overlooked when you think about Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Of course, they were the exception to the rule, too, in that they had
                    been independent for so long. They are widely regarded by other Africans as kind
                    of an appendage to the United States or, indeed, a colony of the United States.
                    That may be a bum rap but there's enough of a grain of truth in it to make one
                    uncomfortable at times, particularly when I arrived there and found the Monrovia
                    Police Department dressed in uniforms that could only have been hand-me-downs
                    from the Los Angeles Police Department, the black shirt and trousers, caps, and
                    so forth. All the armed forces uniforms were also our own secondhand stuff.</p>
                <p>But I was greeted very warmly by a very distinguished African leader, President
                    Tolbert, and we got along famously. I had a few squabbles with the foreign
                    minister, Cecil Dennis, largely on human rights issues, and so forth, because,
                    while a democratic nation, they also ruled with a pretty heavy hand. The
                    indigenous people up country did not fare too well under this, what we called,
                    Americo-Liberian regime—the descendants of American slaves that went back to
                    Liberia to found the country. But the relationship, basically, was one of warmth
                    and cordiality. The president went out of his way to be personally cordial to
                    me, even taking me up with him on a week-long jaunt through the provinces in
                    Northern Liberia as his honored guest, riding with him every step of the way in
                    his limousine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Many. We had certain rights that remain in the classified area concerning
                    the use of Roberts Field, the international airfield there. We have our largest
                    communications set up anywhere in Africa at the embassy in Monrovia, large
                    numbers of communications technicians, and other interests, as well, strategic
                    and otherwise. And, of course, a long, long history of ties to the United
                    States. Many Liberians did, in fact, consider themselves sort of the 51st state,
                    like it or not. And because of corruption that was rampant there, that often was
                    downright embarrassing at times.</p>
                <p>But President Tolbert was very nice. At the same time, we would have to fuss at
                    the foreign minister or the president several times about human rights
                    violations, imprisoning people and then keeping them without charge, that sort
                    of thing. But the main problem was that the Americo-Liberian clique, and they
                    were a small minority in the country, in fact, ruled the country. They
                    controlled the court system, the police, the armed forces, the parliament,
                    everything about life in Liberia.</p>
                <p>And, again, inevitably perhaps after my experience in Ghana, I had come back to
                    the States on a medical evacuation and was an outpatient at the Mayo Clinic in
                    Rochester, Minnesota, when I got the inevitable call at one o'clock in the
                    morning from the desk officer in Washington saying, “Mr. Ambassador, the
                    Secretary would like you back in Liberia like yesterday. There's been a coup.”
                    And we did not anticipate that coup. I would like to be able to say we saw it
                    coming. We did not. We knew there was great unhappiness.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In this case, in April of 1980, a group of enlisted men in the armed forces were
                    down on the beach near the presidential palace drinking beer and they had their
                    weapons with them. One thing led to another and, to make a long story short,
                    they got a group together and went into the presidential palace and murdered
                    President Tolbert. They tracked down virtually the entire cabinet, senior
                    parliamentary leaders, and other prominent Americo-Liberians, and it was a blood
                    bath.</p>
                <p>I got back in the next day on the first flight in. The young man who had taken
                    over the country was a 29-year old master sergeant named Sammy Doe. He was
                    semi-literate, could barely read and write his own name. Could, in fact, barely
                    speak proper English. I literally, at times, would resort to pidgin English to
                    communicate with Sergeant Doe after he became head of state. It was a real body
                    blow, not because we had anything against the indigenous peoples of Liberia, and
                    we knew the faults of the old regime, but at the same time, the blood bath that
                    followed was inexcusable.</p>
                <p>There were a few frantic days, and they were frantic because this unleashed this
                    latent hatred which was there on the part of the enlisted men in the armed
                    forces, and the first order Doe gave was that you no longer have to obey the
                    orders of your officers either in the police force or in the army. You can
                    imagine the kind of chaos that resulted from that. So they were stopping people
                    on the street, dragging people from their beds and murdering them. In the case
                    of the cabinet, tying them to stakes on the beach and executing them by firing
                    squad.</p>
                <p>This, despite the fact that in the morning I had again gone to see Sergeant Doe
                    and given him a personal appeal from President Carter to spare their lives. He
                    heard me but made no commitment. That afternoon my public affairs officer burst
                    into my office and said, “Mr. Ambassador, my God, they have done it. They've
                    shot all of them. They've killed all of them, eight or nine lined up on the
                    beach tied to a stake.” So it was a bloody mess.</p>
                <p>Worse yet, we had the obvious concern about these ignorant, poorly educated,
                    almost illiterate enlisted men being gotten to by the other side and being
                    turned around and having Liberia wind up as a communist state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the Soviets were there and very interested in all this, although
                    they were completely nonplused by the coup. But they immediately saw an
                    opportunity here and tried to move in on it. And I must say, I think one of the
                    major things that saved us there was not, certainly, the charm or good looks of
                    the American ambassador, but rather the presence of a U.S. military mission that
                    had been there for decades, headed, in my tenure, by a tough, charming Texas
                    full colonel in the Army named Bob Gosney who was the head of the U.S. Military
                    Mission and who, in that capacity, had helped train Master Sergeant Doe. Master
                    Sergeant Doe adored Colonel Gosney, and called him “Chief.” He referred to him
                    always in the third person as “the Chief.”</p>
                <p>I very quickly became cognizant of this and I started taking Colonel Gosney with
                    me when I went to see Sammy Doe. This helped enormously because he respected and
                    had total confidence in Colonel Gosney. He knew little and cared less about
                    communism and the Soviet Union. There was nothing ideological. This was a
                    genuine tribal upheaval to get rid of the hated upper classes and to bring more
                    privileges to the underprivileged. So Sammy Doe was not then and is not now a
                    politically ideological person. But I can't emphasize strongly enough how
                    helpful it was to have this small group of American Army officers, consisting of
                    a group of lieutenant colonels and majors who had, instead of lording it over
                    the enlisted men of the armed forces as their Liberian counterparts did, the
                    Americans, being Americans, would learn these fellows names, including Sergeant
                    Doe, and so forth, and they were warm and cordial to their underlings. And, as a
                    result, Sergeant Doe quickly passed the word that whatever the chief says,
                    goes.</p>
                <p>So I had the members of my military mission out in their vehicles literally
                    patrolling the streets. And when they would see a drunken or doped up Liberian
                    soldier holding a group of civilians at gunpoint or something, trying to rob
                    them, or rape them or whatever, one word from one of my American officers would
                    stop that dead in its tracks. They would stop, salute, and say, “Yes, sir,” and
                    go on about their business. It saved lives, literally saved lives, this personal
                    relationship that they had established. And that really sustained us for a very
                    lengthy period before their government got formed and Sammy Doe came up with a
                    foreign minister who was bright and well educated that we could deal with.</p>
                <p>The problem was that Sammy Doe and his immediate cohorts, to me, were, of course,
                    in a very personal sense, murderers. They had murdered William Tolbert, who was
                    a very dear friend of mine, and the other members of the cabinet with whom I had
                    been very close. And yet, here they were, the new government. It was clearly not
                    in our national interest to see the country go down the tubes, so it fell to me
                    to do what we could to sustain this young man in steering along a certain
                    course, which we managed to do with great difficulty.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>But that led to a situation in which he came to lean on me and the embassy almost
                    too much. He would summon me at all hours of the night to say, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    we have a problem.” He would state the problem and wait for me to come up with a
                    solution. So at times it came very uncomfortably close to running a country that
                    you really don't want any part of, and always putting out fires and fears that
                    he had. He had a fear that Houphou�t-Boigny, President of the Ivory Coast, whose
                    daughter was married to Tolbert's son, with the help of French troops was going
                    to invade Liberia.</p>
                <p>So it was a question of hanging in there and doing what we could to moderate the
                    behavior of Sergeant Doe and his government. And I think we were relatively
                    successful, as was my successor, Bill Swing, who had a long tenure there, about
                    five years, pumping in a great deal of American aid, especially to the military,
                    since the unhappiness of the military with their lot in life was one of the main
                    causes of the coup.</p>
                <p>It was an exciting time. The Secretary ordered me to evacuate American
                    dependents. We had to get them out of the country right after the coup when the
                    troops were running wild. So it was, perhaps, the most exciting time in my
                    Foreign Service career, but not the most satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any other pressures? You found the
                        situation repugnant to you, I mean, dealing with people whom you had to deal
                        with, but there had been Pulitzer Prize winning photographs of these leaders
                        being executed and all this, there must have been a lot of pressure from
                        Congress, and from the news press, and all that. Did this translate to you
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. We felt we were really operating in a goldfish bowl or under a
                    microscope, I should say. Human rights pressure inevitably came into this
                    picture after the coup. But strangely enough, not a great deal of congressional
                    pressure. Everyone was sickened, of course, by what happened out there. But you
                    can't reverse that and I think everyone saw that what we had to concentrate on
                    was where do we go from there. And I had to keep reminding people of some of the
                    things that the previous government had done and why the depths of anger being
                    felt by these people was quite genuine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any pressure from the black caucus one
                        way or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I had a number of visits out there. Congressman Bill Gray came out, Julian
                    Dixon, those two members. I had Andy Young, then at the UN, come out a couple of
                    times before the coup. He also visited me in Ghana a couple times. But not undue
                    congressional pressure. I had more congressional pressure in South Africa than
                    anyplace else, in particular from Charlie Diggs. He did not like our policy in
                    South Africa. Indeed, he would not have been happy unless we had broken
                    relations, I think.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>But I've talked long enough. It's been a fascinating and very satisfying career.
                    I retired in January of 1981, sort of in the middle of all this, but I felt, for
                    a number of reasons, that I had to. One, the Department offered a monetary
                    incentive to do that. Secondly, I developed a medical problem which was
                    beginning to worry me. After a couple of times when I stumbled going up the
                    steps to the presidential mansion I realized, hey, I've really got to do
                    something about this. These trips back to Mayo didn't get to the bottom of it.
                    My right leg was deteriorating. To make a long story short, only after I retired
                    and got back here and started running the African Wildlife Foundation did they
                    discover that I, in fact, have multiple sclerosis. So it's just as well I
                    retired when I did because I just didn't have the stamina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And strain is a major factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Stress, as the doctor says, is contraindicated for MS patients. And in
                    those last two posts, particularly Liberia, I had more than my share.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these interviews we try to ask two questions. One, what
                        do you consider your greatest achievement or what did you do that gave you
                        the greatest satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I would have to say, I guess, in my last post, keeping Liberia, quite
                    literally, from going down the tubes. I know countries don't go bankrupt but
                    Liberia came about as close as any country could, I think. We had to resort to
                    some pretty imaginative policy initiatives to keep that from happening in
                    Liberia. To keep Liberia from going down the tubes and basically, to retain the
                    feeling that Liberians continue to have toward the United States despite all
                    that happened out there. I think to keep that ship on a steady keel was perhaps
                    the greatest achievement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And lastly, if a young person came to you today, how do
                        you feel about the Foreign Service as a career as you see it today? Would
                        you recommend it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There's nothing wrong with the tape, I'm having to think about that long
                    and hard. I say that for a number of reasons. Our number two son, Steve, and his
                    wife, Jacqueline, are Foreign Service officers serving in Sri Lanka right now,
                    at the embassy in Colombo. They're coming back here in June. The other three of
                    our children didn't show any interest in it.</p>
                <p>The foreign service, I think, has changed a great deal since I left. Let me put
                    it this way: While I would still recommend the foreign service as a career to a
                    particular kind of youngster, I, perhaps, would not do so with the same
                    enthusiasm that I would have 20 years ago. I think the service has changed, not
                    for the better, but for the worse.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>And while I think I am a feminist and a strong supporter of women's rights, I
                    think some changes in that area, too, have been unfortunate in that my wife
                    never worked “outside the home” throughout our foreign service career, but I
                    could literally not have survived any of my posts without her. We always
                    considered ourselves a team in a real sense of that word at all of our posts.
                    And I'm afraid, from what I hear from my younger colleagues, that's no longer
                    the case. Something has happened that I can't quite put my finger on that makes
                    me uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>And, also, I liked the sense that you and I had when we went in the Service that
                    this is it, this is our career. The kids today, apparently, aren't going into
                    the service with that feeling. And moreover, I'm told, they are being told not
                    to go into the service with that attitude because it probably won't happen that
                    way and that you should consider the Foreign Service another interlude in your
                    life and you'll be lucky if you get 20 years out of it. I don't think that can
                    stimulate the kind of loyalty, and support, and devotion that, with all due
                    modesty, I think you and I reflected during our career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand exactly what you're saying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I find that pretty sad.</p>
