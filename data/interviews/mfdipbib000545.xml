                <p>Biosketch: John N. Hutchison</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, I'm going to ask you to start out by giving us a
                        rather brief background on your origins, what you did and where you got your
                        education, your work before you came to USIA, and that will involve your
                        period in the Army as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I was born in Iowa, and when I was 12, I moved with my family to
                    northern Arkansas, and went to high school there. As a teenager, I became a
                    printer on a little four-page country weekly that was entirely set by hand. Then
                    eventually on several occasions, I worked there for varying periods, and finally
                    became the editor of the paper, which wasn't a very demanding job for
                    journalists as we see them today, but it taught me the fundamentals of type and
                    space and a little bit of writing.</p>
                <p>I went to the University of Arkansas, having graduated from high school in 1928.
                    We were a poor family, and I couldn't go for two years, but I finally went down
                    to the University at Fayetteville, and attended for one year. I had to stay out
                    another three years while I saved my money and worked at all kinds of jobs
                    locally. Finally I went back for another three years and got my degree in
                    journalism.</p>
                <p>I went immediately, because of an instructor-professor who interceded for me, to
                    Cincinnati as a cub reporter on the Post, a Scripps-Howard to go down to Memphis
                    to the Commercial Teal, where I was a reporter and assistant city editor.</p>
                <p>World War II: Army Service</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Having had a commission through ROTC in the Army, I was called to active duty and
                    went to Fort Benning, Georgia, in February of 1041, for a short, intensive
                    course in the armored division, with all the weapons and vehicles of an armored
                    division. And shortly thereafter, I was named the public relations officer for
                    the Second Armored Division, which was commanded by George Patton. Patton, at
                    the time I went there, was a brigadier general. He got his second Star while at
                    Benning.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1942, we were sent out to the district training center near
                    Indio, California, ostensibly training to go assist the British in the Libyan
                    desert. But in the meantime, that campaign had pretty well come to an end. We
                    were put on a troop train and sent off to Washington, where we began to plan for
                    the invasion of North Africa.</p>
                <p>On November 8, 1942, we landed in Morocco, after a brisk battle with the French
                    Navy. I was on board a cruiser, which was the command ship for the operation on
                    which Patton and his staff went to Morocco.</p>
                <p>After that, I went up to Algeria from Morocco, to a town called Mostaganem where
                    our headquarters had become an armored corps, and was destined to become Seventh
                    Army, organized for the operation against Sicily. I was in the landings on
                    Sicily and was there through that campaign. Then I was transferred to General
                    Eisenhower's headquarters back in Algiers, and was a member of Eisenhower's
                    staff. Subsequently, after he went to London, I became a member of his
                    successor's staff, the staff of General Jacob Devers' Army group and was in the
                    invasion of South France. We went up through France and over into Germany, and
                    when V-E Day came — and, as a matter of fact, when V-J Day came — I was in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The three years in North Africa and Europe acquainted me with hundreds of war
                    correspondents and war photographers from the United States, Britain, and some
                    other countries, many of whom were to become famous — Walter Cronkite, Hal
                    Boyle, Drew Middleton, John Charles Daly, Merrill Mueller, Ernie Pyle, David
                    Brown, Alex Clifford, Maggie Higgins, Bob Capa, Carl Mydans, Margaret
                    Bourke-White, George Silk, and John Phillips. In France and Germany I operated a
                    “press camp” which followed the war front closely. It provided as many as 50 or
                    60 correspondents at a time with transportation food, lodging and communications
                    (including a large mobile transmitter system sending press copy direct to New
                    York). I entered active duty with the Army in 1941. By 1944 I was a Lieutenant
                    Colonel.</p>
                <p>Recruitment Into Marshall Plan 1948-1952</p>
                <p>I came home after three years in Europe and Africa, having spent five years in
                    the Army. I joined the Scripps-Howard paper in San Francisco as a reporter. I
                    then was recruited for the new staffing of the Marshall Plan, which Averell
                    Harriman and Paul Hoffman were organizing, with Harriman in Paris running the
                    European headquarters, and Hoffman in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My assignment was as Deputy Director of Labor Information. I was in Paris in this
                    job and a subsequent job as Deputy Director of Information for four years. The
                    Marshall Plan itself began to wind down and become more military and to change
                    its character. Since it had a massive information program, by the standards of
                    those days, throughout 17 countries in Europe and clear to Turkey, this
                    operation had been quite independent of the State Department's information
                    program, the predecessor of USIA. We had a very innovative and inventive
                    program, with many people who had come in from private life, not from other
                    government jobs. It had developed in many directions that were quite new and
                    strange to the State Department's information program.</p>
                <p>1952: Marshall Plan Phases Down; Many Of Its Information Team Goes To IIA</p>
                <p>People in Washington realized that since this program was coming to an end, it
                    should somehow be folded in, or dovetailed with, the State Department's
                    information program. These were the days when Charlie Hulten was General Manager
                    of what was then called the International Information Agency (IIA) —
                    Department's information operation under Ed Barrett, who was the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for public affairs. One of the early people in that
                    organization was Bill Cody. Charlie Hulten and Bill Cody came to Paris and began
                    to work with us on how to wrap these two operations together, presumably to get
                    the best out of each, and to find some way to adapt a rather stodgy State
                    Department program with a rather unorthodox Marshall Plan information operation,
                    which had been very free-wheeling, and had lots of so-called counterpart funds
                    (money that the European countries put up to match various grants or loans from
                    the United States). We had been really free-spenders, and this was now slowing
                    down.</p>
                <p>I was recruited by Charlie Hulten to come back to Washington. He asked me to join
                    what is now USIA. The Press Service of IIA (IPS) had a vacancy, and I was put in
                    charge of the European branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at IPS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: This was at IPS. At that time, this was still part of the State
                    Department. It hadn't yet become USIA, but that was about to take place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you became head of the European branch of IPS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCarthy Strikes</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I served in that job only a few months, five or six months. I should
                    have said that even before I got back from Europe, Senator Joe McCarthy had
                    begun his very vicious campaign and had directed a great deal of it against the
                    information operation and the State Department and, in particular, against the
                    military government operation in Germany. By the time I had been in my new job,
                    I guess five or six months, McCarthy was really savaging what is now USIA,
                    blackmailing people right and left, and directing most of his attacks at the
                    Voice of America and at the cultural programs, but also going after much of the
                    leadership of IPS.</p>
                <p>One day, Wolf von Eckert was fired, or was forced to leave, is what it amounted
                    to, principally because he had been accused by McCarthy of leftist leanings.
                    Wolf left summarily one morning after he came to work, bounced out, and I was
                    asked to take over his job. He was the head of the division — at the moment I
                    forget what it was called — that produced the wireless file and various other
                    news and features services of IPS, a major division with some 220 employees.</p>
                <p>That morning I started out with 22 employees in my branch. At about 10:00 in the
                    morning, I had become the head of a division with 220 people, and by 11:00 in
                    the morning, I was called up to the head offices of the agency to talk with a
                    group of people in the Eisenhower Administration who had been sent in on a
                    temporary consultancy basis, presumably to reform the organization. I was asked
                    to take over the directorship of IPS itself, because Charlie Arnold, who had
                    been the director, had been blackmailed out by McCarthy, and so had his deputy,
                    Charlie Miller. They had both been given the axe for reasons no more justified
                    than that for which McCarthy's group went after Wolf von Eckert.</p>
                <p>So I sat there in an office that, as I recall, used to be on the fourth floor,
                    talking to this group who were asking me to take over this new job, and I hadn't
                    even had time to move my files to Wolf von Eckert's desk. I said, “Well, I'll
                    take it, but I think you should clearly understand that I'm a Democrat and that
                    you obviously want Republicans in these jobs. That's already been made apparent.
                    Consequently, I would ask if I take it, you make it quite clear that I'm in
                    there temporarily as Acting Director. Don't name me director, because I don't
                    want it to look as if I've been unsuccessful and sacked. Then I would ask that
                    you give me complete authority to run IPS as I see fit, and if you don't like
                    it, fire me.” And to my astonishment, they all readily agreed. They apparently
                    were eager to have somebody move into it.</p>
                <p>I went out to lunch by myself, sat down at a lunch counter around the corner
                    there, where the old passport office [was], thinking this whole thing over, this
                    astonishing morning. I went back and sat down as Director of IPS and as the
                    deputy director. (laughs) I stayed in the job for, I guess, about two years,
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>At the end of 1954, for a combination of reasons, I resigned and went out to
                    California and went to work as the PR director for a United Fund operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we were discussing some of this same subject matter
                        off the tape before lunch, you indicated some of the reasons for your
                        resignation, one of them being your unhappiness with the gentleman who had
                        been named the director of the IPS operation and whom you didn't think was
                        doing anything. Would you care to comment on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How Arthur Compton Became Director of IIA</p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: When I went to the agency, it was under the State Department. Then it
                    went through a reorganization under the Eisenhower Administration, and became
                    USIA, an independent agency. It had been directed late in the Truman
                    Administration by a man named Arthur Compton.</p>
                <p>The story, as I heard it — and it's probably true — is that in the Truman
                    Administration, some people in the White House were sitting around speculating
                    on whom to appoint to run the then-State Department's information operation
                    abroad. Someone said, “Why not ask Dr. Compton?” Well, there were three Compton
                    brothers. One was the president of a university in St. Louis who had a Nobel
                    Prize. He was an eminent scientist. One I do not remember at all in terms of his
                    qualifications. The third was a West Coast lumberman, and he also had a title.
                    He must have had a Ph.D. and was referred to as Dr. Compton. Somebody said, “Why
                    don't we get Dr. Compton?”</p>
                <p>Truman is said to have told someone, “Go to the phone and ask him if he'll do
                    it.”</p>
                <p>The story is that whoever went to the phone called the wrong Dr. Compton. Instead
                    of calling the man at St. Louis University or Washington University, I forget
                    which, he called Arthur Compton, the lumberman, who cheerfully accepted the job.
                    At that point, nobody knew how to undo this act, although he was the wrong
                    brother. And that's how, supposedly, Dr. Arthur Compton became head of the
                    information operation, for which he had no talent, background, grasp, whatever.
                    He was the head of this operation when McCarthy was savaging it, and when
                    McCarthy called him to come up and testify before his committee, Compton refused
                    to go, went off to his home somewhere in Virginia and was never seen in the
                    office again, leaving Reed Harris, hid deputy, to bear the brunt of this and
                    take a terrible beating from McCarthy, because Reed had written a book in the
                    1930s which McCarthy thought was communist in its intent. Harris was driven out
                    of the agency by McCarthy.</p>
                <p>I remember Jack O'Brien, who was the Far East Branch chief in those days in IPS,
                    telling that his wife was watching McCarthy on television, wrecking Reed Harris'
                    life, and at the end of the day, she got on the phone to Reed Harris at home,
                    and all she could say was, “Mr. Harris, I think you're a peach.” Harris was
                    widely admired in the agency and, of course, he was brought back into it by Ed

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Then in came Dr. Johnson. He arrived during a period when Congress had slashed
                    the budget, McCarthy had driven out dozens of honest, talented people, and the
                    Agency was going through a devastating reduction in force. Demoralization was
                    almost total.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Dr. Johnson was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Robert Johnson. He had been the president of Temple University in
                    Philadelphia. He was not a scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but he
                    apparently had been a successful fund raiser for Temple and made it into a much
                    more prosperous and presumably effective institution than it had been before he
                    came in there. I think he had also been associated with Henry Luce in the
                    establishment of Time magazine, which gave anybody a cachet, regardless of
                    talent. Johnson was an utter fool, a genial, good-natured man, but without the
                    faintest grasp of the job he had accepted, and he never seemed to develop any.
                    He would listen and accept advice from anybody, and from the next person he
                    listened to, he would accept diametrically different advice. He was a complete
                    joke in the agency. He had come there surrounded by a little coterie of people,
                    many of them quite expert in their own fields, but largely in commercial
                    advertising and public relations. They surrounded him as a kind of protective
                    cocoon, attempting to get this new, independent USIA [Editor's Note: Johnson's
                    short term actually preceded the formal establishment of USIA, which was created
                    by Eisenhower's Executive Order of August 1, 1983, when Streibert was named
                    Director.] going and get some structure and some direction for it and some
                    policy. I think many of them were pretty skilled, and I think almost all of them
                    finally went back to wherever they came from, mostly from Madison Avenue. They
                    were unable to manage this man at all. He was an unmanageable lump! (Laughs) And
                    gave rise to endless jokes.</p>
                <p>He brought in a new religious advisor. We had had a fine retired Presbyterian
                    minister, with very broad religious training and experience, who had been our
                    advisor for the agency on religious attitudes of our audiences abroad. He was a
                    real scholar, knowledgeable on all religion. Johnson replaced him with a man
                    whose name, I recall was Trueblood, who promptly, upon his appointment, made a
                    speech somewhere in Maryland stating that the objective of the agency was to
                    make every person in the world a card-carrying Christian. (Laughs) He used to
                    come in and lecture us various practical operators on religious subjects, and he
                    soon became known as Dr. Bloodshot. He, too, became the butt of many jokes.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>It was a violent, demoralizing, terrible period in USIA. The destructive attacks
                    my McCarthy, his aides, Cohn and Schine who harassed and humiliated many USIS
                    officers abroad, and my McCarthyite supporters in Congress, ripped innocent
                    personnel from the agency and exposed it to near-catastrophic budget slashing. A
                    Congressman Taber set a goal for USIA's budget which he had carefully calculated
                    would compel the separation of enough employees so that the cost of their
                    retirement would wipe out the remaining funds. He failed of this objective, but
                    not by much. There were senators — Ellender of Louisiana and McClellan of
                    Arkansas come readily to mind — whose hostility toward USIA and ignorance of its
                    purpose were unrelenting. A timid White House stood nervously away from this
                    indecent spectacle through most of it, until public opinion finally overwhelmed
                    McCarthy.</p>
                <p>Although IPS was not pilloried to the extent suffered by VOA and ICS, some of its
                    most talented and dedicated people were blackmailed and hounded out, or so
                    battered by accusations of incompetence or anti-Americanism that they quit in
                    disgust.</p>
                <p>The second shock to hit the agency was a deep cut in budget which resulted in a
                    drastic reduction in force. I was ordered to reduce IPS at once by about 20
                    percent, and similar cuts were imposed on most of the agency. We selected out
                    and fired almost 100 competent, loyal, IPS people, under a law expressly passed
                    by Congress permitting USIA to “weed out” personnel without regard to civil
                    service protection. I personally and privately, in my office, told each
                    individual being fired. It was the most painful executive experience of my
                    life.</p>
                <p>With such a radical RIF, we had to completely reorganize IPS.</p>
                <p>This is a good point in the discussion for me to pay tribute to those people
                    whose names I can remember after 35 years who made it possible for IPS to come
                    through that tumultuous period and continue to produce. Jim Thomas, Tom Cannon,
                    Bill deMeza, Mort Levin, Gene Clark and Elva Deal were the management group that
                    guided me through my first appropriations hearings and the rebuilding of the
                    service. I could fill a page with the names of others down through IPS who met
                    the challenges expertly and with good spirit. I still think of IPS with pride
                    and affection.</p>
                <p>1953: USIA Formally Established: Ted Streibert Named Director</p>
                <p>I don't remember exactly when Johnson left, but he was succeeded, as I recall by
                    Ted Streibert. I can't even remember the ostensible reason that Johnson left,
                    but he was eased out. Streibert had been, I think, head of Mutual Broadcasting,
                    and was presumably a very successful man in that field. He probably was good for
                    the agency at the time. He was an incredibly abrasive man, who seemed to offend
                    people deliberately, and yet he shook the agency out of the terrible panic it
                    had been going through with all the reorganizations, all the attacks by
                    McCarthy, the indirection and confusion. Streibert moved in as a very vigorous
                    man, and sort of shook it out of all this situation, and in that sense was
                    probably good for it. But he wasn't very intelligent about what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>He used to come back after a trip overseas full of opinions on how USIA ought to
                    operate. For example, he came back from a Tokyo trip, and came in and bounced me
                    around because the wireless file didn't get there at the right time of day in
                    Tokyo. You know, it comes in a day late. (Laughs) I tried to tell him, “Mr.
                    Streibert, we cover the news here when there's news happening, and most of our
                    news happens in Washington, in the daytime. We send it out as soon as we can. We
                    don't wait for another day so it'll get to Tokyo in daylight.” He never
                    understood this. He seemed to think we either had to get it there before it
                    happened, or to keep it until it would be the right time of day for the Tokyo
                    newspapers. This was illustrative of his misunderstanding of the practicalities
                    of our agency.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that on many occasions, almost every time he held a staff
                    meeting, he deliberately insulted the people around the table one at a time. It
                    was a part of his technique of management. Apparently he felt this was the way
                    to stimulate people to do better, and so he would really be outright offensive
                    to people.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I had been replaced as Director of IPS by an ideologically pure
                    successor. (Laughs) He was Harlan Logan, a remarkably fine man with no
                    particular background for what we were doing, but a quick study. I was demoted
                    to deputy.</p>
                <p>He came from Corning Glass, where he was their head of public relations. He was a
                    highly intelligent man who got a quick grasp of what we were doing. He learned
                    very rapidly what we were all about, and I got on extremely well with him. He
                    finally left, though, after, as I recall, only six months or certainly less than
                    a year, because his wife had developed incurable cancer. She was in New York,
                    and he was going back and forth between Sloan-Kettering and his job in
                    Washington, and finally in despair, he said, “I just can't keep this up. I've
                    just got to go were her through to the end of this, and we're going to take a
                    world cruise or something or other and made the best of it.” And he resigned. I
                    was very sorry to see him go.</p>
                <p>As I recall it, I was once again made Director, or Acting Director, of IPS, and I
                    ran it again for quite a long time. Then finally they brought in Leland Stanford
                    Briggs, a retired McCann-Erickson advertising man, who was independently well
                    off, hadn't really done anything significant in McCann-Erickson for some time,
                    and showed little interest in what USIA was doing. He had no particular talent
                    for it, and no idea of doing any work. I think he had been brought in somehow
                    have been assured by political friends that all he had to do was just come and
                    accept the job, and that it wouldn't be very demanding.</p>
                <p>Hutchison Resigns From USIA: 1955</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So I stayed a while, and finally, with this rather discouraging man for a
                    superior, with Streibert's very abrasive personality in the front office, with
                    an aging father on the California coast, and with considerable disaffection with
                    the administration running Washington, for all these various reasons, I came out
                    to San Francisco and got a job, went back to Washington and resigned. I was so
                    irritated with Streibert that I submitted my resignation to his deputy, Abbott
                    Washburn, not to Streibert. Abbott and I always got on very well.</p>
                <p>I came out to San Francisco and organized the public relations for a new
                    five-county United Fund, which had just itself been organized a year before. I
                    held the job for about four and a half years. Of the scores of social and
                    charitable agencies we were raising funds for, one was Red Cross, which had
                    seven chapters in our United Fund area. I was recruited to go back to be the
                    National Director of Information for the Red Cross because of the recommendation
                    from the major chapter in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>So I went back to Washington. The job didn't turn out particularly well for me.
                    The Red Cross had spent quite a bit of money to move me and my family back
                    there, and I was being paid well, but I decided, after a year, I had to resign.
                    So I went over to USIA and sounded out USIA.</p>
                <p>Hutchison Returns To USIA As Director Of Press Service: 1960</p>
                <p>The year, as I recall, was 1960. I quite the Red Cross on a Friday and went to
                    work literally at the same desk I had left in IPS, as Director of IPS, on the
                    following Monday, having taken both the oral and written Foreign Service
                    examination and going in this time not in civil service, but in a Foreign
                    Service status. I stayed about a year and a half as Director of IPS, having
                    succeeded Bill Copeland. This is at the time when George Allen was head of the
                    Agency, having replaced Arthur Larson, who had for a short time succeeded Ted
                    Streibert.</p>
                <p>Just as a comment, I think George Allen was a very good selection. He was an old
                    State Department bureaucrat, he knew his way around Congress, he had, I believe,
                    been Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, so that he knew what the
                    agency was doing. He didn't create a lot of waves, but he knew how to guide this
                    agency through a period which was still pretty unsettled. He had lots of
                    diplomatic experience. As a matter of fact, it was George Allen whom Bill Cody
                    and I went to see in Belgrade when Allen was ambassador there. Bill Cody and I
                    went down there at somebody's request to help with a study of how to interlock,
                    or dovetail, the remnants of the Marshall Plan information program with the
                    State Department's program. That had been my first contact with Allen.</p>
                <p>Allen was then succeeded, I guess, by Murrow (After several months. John Kennedy
                    had just been elected (Nov. 1960). Allen knew he would be replaced after the
                    inauguration. He left for a lucrative job in private business. Murrow came on
                    deck in early March, 1961.). Was there anybody in between there?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, there was not. But there was quite a hiatus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Allen left and went to the Tobacco Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went to the Tobacco Institute. A lot of people didn't
                        know how he could possibly bring himself morally to do that and criticized
                        him for doing it, but he did go there. It was a very well-paying job which
                        he held for three or four years. I think it made him a wealthy man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: He resigned from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Allen had not necessarily wanted to be director of the
                        agency. He was Ambassador to Greece at the time, and came to USIA at the
                        express request of President Eisenhower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I had forgotten that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Eisenhower persuaded him to come back and take
                        the job, because in between Streibert and Allen, had been Arthur Larson, who
                        was an utter disaster. So when Eisenhower asked Larson to resign, he then
                        went after Allen. That's how he became the director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I think Allen was probably a good man for the time. I don't know that
                    he was particularly inventive or innovative, but I think he was a very
                    stabilizing and, I think, pretty shrewd, knowledgeable man, and probably was
                    good for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was well thought of on the Hill, whereas Larson was
                        not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes, his liaison with Congress was good, and he was articulate. He
                    seemed to be a very calm man. He didn't get rattled. He had a good
                    personality.</p>
                <p>Then came Ed Murrow, and with Ed Murrow came Tom Sorensen and Don Wilson. Wilson
                    and Sorensen were sometimes referred around the agency as “Boy Scouts with Tommy
                    guns.” I didn't hit it off at all well with Wilson. You never knew whether you
                    were hitting it off with Sorensen or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But Wilson recruited some people from his Time magazine background, and one of
                    them was the cause of a really serious falling out between Wilson and me. This
                    man is currently quite a successful author, and I've watched some of his
                    television programs — David McCullough. I guess he's best known right now for
                    his book on the Panama Canal, which I've read. McCullough was off the staff of
                    Time, where he did little pieces for the back of the book. Wilson ordered me to
                    employ him in IPS, and virtually picked out the job for him.McCullough came to
                    work for one of the IPS magazines.</p>
                <p>A man named Clint Green was McCullough's supervisor. I forget how Clint came to
                    the agency. He had been an INS correspondent and he'd been a war correspondent
                    during World War II. He had also been a USIS officer abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was assigned to be the information officer in Tokyo. He
                        came about ten months after I had been there, and he left about a year
                        before I left. He was the information officer from sometime early in 1953
                        until 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Clint was in charge of the publications division of IPS. It concerned
                    any magazines, including Amerika, the Russian-language magazine, Problems of
                    Communism, which was a scholarly journal, and an Arabic magazine. Clint, as
                    supervisor, wound up with David McCullough on his staff, without having invited
                    him. McCullough couldn't accommodate himself to bureaucracy. He made commitments
                    for magazine articles, as I recall, that didn't follow the approved methods of
                    contracting that we were required to do. So Clint Green had to, first, explain
                    to him, and eventually order him to do these things in accordance with our legal
                    procedures.</p>
                <p>Their personalities clashed almost immediately, and McCullough was absolutely
                    unable to accommodate himself to any orders from a superior. Finally it got to
                    be such an open row that I had to call both of them in and tell McCullough to do
                    what his supervisors asked him, as long as the supervisor was within his legal
                    authority. And McCullough defied me right on the spot. So I said, “Well, you
                    know, if you aren't going to take orders from us, I'll prefer charges and do my
                    best to get you out of here. We're all responsible in the government hierarchy,
                    and we have to follow procedures.”</p>
                <p>He went promptly to Don Wilson. Don Wilson, within an hour, was in my office,
                    giving me hell for ordering McCullough around, because McCullough was his
                    prot�g�. We had a real row in my office there. I said to Wilson, “I should think
                    you would recognize that all I'm asking of McCullough to do is to follow
                    legitimate instructions, just as I must follow yours. I have to do what my
                    superiors say, and my subordinates have to do what I say.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Well, it really tore things between me and Wilson. Within a fairly short time,
                    he, in effect, sacked me from IPS. It wasn't done quite that way; I was told
                    that I was going to be sent overseas (which I had had in mind anyway when I
                    entered through Foreign Service). The fact of going overseas didn't both me so
                    much; it was because I was, in effect, being fired for acting the way a
                    supervisor is supposed to act, by my standards.</p>
                <p>One little background to this was that there had been some bad blood between
                    Wilson and Green in Japan, and I never knew quite what it was (This argument
                    could not have been in Japan unless it was much earlier when Wilson was a young
                    correspondent in the Tokyo Time office. Green left USIS Tokyo in 1955. Wilson
                    became Deputy Director of USIA only in 1961. Wilson and Green did see each other
                    often in Tokyo at the Overseas Press Club.). I'm not clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not clear what it was, but they may have had an
                        argument of some type there, but there was also another argument between
                        Wilson and Green in Washington since Clint also had overall supervision for
                        the magazine Problems of Communism. Abe Brumberg was then the editor. Well,
                        you know Abe and his irascible personality. Wilson tended to side with
                        Brumberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Brumberg went over my head to Wilson, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brumberg was a terribly peculiar guy — extremely difficult
                        to get along with. A brilliant man, but impossible to control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: He was utterly undisciplined about contracting. It was a constant
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wilson felt that Clint was being too bureaucratic with
                        Brumberg, but I felt that he should have knocked him over the head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1962: Hutchison Leaves IPS To Be DPAO In London</p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes. Brumberg caused me a lot to trouble.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the upshot of this was that I was offered the choice of going to Tokyo,
                    Paris, or London. I believe in each case as deputy PAO, subject to acceptance by
                    the current PAO. I picked London. I knew Bill, not well, but I knew him and had
                    worked with him some. Joe Phillips was area director for Europe, and Joe and I
                    knew each other well. (I should have explained earlier that back during World
                    War II, I was Joe Phillip's executive office when Joe was public relations
                    officer for Eisenhower in Algiers. I didn't see him again until we both wound up
                    in USIA at some later period.)</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>So I went off to London as deputy to Bill Clark. I had four years in London
                    without home leave, not that that's a privation; but it's a little unusual. And
                    wound up as acting PAO when Bill Clark was brought back to Washington and became
                    the deputy commissioner for that Canadian, Montreal World's Fair.</p>
                <p>I was in London in an interesting time. There was, of course, tremendous
                    agitation in Britain from the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament. We had big
                    demonstrations in front of the embassy periodically and some quite serious ones.
                    I remember one time four ranks of British bobbies, clear across the steps of the
                    embassy there in Grosvenor Square, with their arms locked together as a barrier
                    to several thousands of really violent demonstrators trying to break through.
                    They had to use horses to break them up.</p>
                <p>I was there when John Glenn came over to London, ostensibly on a private tour. We
                    had already had the capsule over there on exhibition, had a tremendous success
                    with parading it through London and exhibiting it at the embassy, the capsule in
                    which Glenn rode. Glenn came over some time later, and I remember introducing
                    him to an audience of scientists in our little embassy auditorium. I think it
                    was the British Astronomical Society or something like that. Glenn had brought
                    along his model of the upcoming moon shot, and he took it apart. He showed how
                    the booster would fall off the rocket and then the whole thing would go on to
                    the moon, other pieces would fall away, it would land, then they would take off
                    again, and the booster would drop off. He took these pieces apart as a
                    demonstration as he was lecturing, and I remember I was supposed to make some
                    kind of remarks at the end of the thing, thank the people for coming or
                    whatever. I remember doing it by just saying to John Glenn, “I don't believe a
                    word you say.” (Laughs) Which got a good hand.</p>
                <p>1962: The Cuban Missile Crisis and London Reactions</p>
                <p>I was there during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was probably the most
                    interesting diplomatic event of the time, as nearly as I can recall.
                    Intelligence officers brought over the pictures that had been taken of the
                    missile sites in Cuba, these big enlargements of aerial photos, to show to the
                    British, to the prime minister, who was then MacMillan, as I recall, to Lord
                    Hume, who was foreign minister, later became prime minister, and all the
                    intelligence community in Britain. When Bill Clark and Jim Pettis, the press
                    attach� there, and I saw these pictures, they were all very highly classified,
                    of course, absolutely top classification. Bill said immediately, “We're got to
                    get these unclassified and get them published here in Britain right as fast as
                    we can.” There was a terrible uproar about this.</p>
                <p>Finally, the senior officer, who had brought them over — I don't remember at the
                    moment who he was — he was undoubtedly CIA, but I don't know who he was or what
                    his position was, but a very senior officer had brought them over with some
                    other members of his staff. Finally, he took it upon himself to authorize a
                    declassification of these pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the spot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: On the spot. We turned them loose, and, of course, they were a
                    sensation in the British press, and they did exactly what the United States
                    wanted to have happen. It gave them unmistakable evidence that the Russians
                    really were in Cuba, which there had been a great deal of suspicion that we were
                    exaggerating this up until that time. Very hard to sell this idea to the
                    British, but that did it. Hume himself came on television with blow-ups of these
                    pictures and a pointer. (Laughs) And went on BBC with these things. So we had
                    absolute saturation coverage of the evidence of these missiles.</p>
                <p>We got a rocket out of Washington almost within minutes of the publication of
                    these things. (Laughs) Woke our press attach� up in the middle of the night,
                    said, “Who the hell gave you permission to turn those pictures loose?” Jim just
                    said, “The guy that brought 'em.” “Oh.” And that was the end of that.
                    (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if he had cleared it back with his people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I don't think he did. He gave them the authority right there on the
                    spot. Maybe he didn't even let them know afterwards. I don't know the background
                    on that, but it was a great little hour for Jim Pettis, because he was feeling
                    like he was kind of on the hot seat. He had actually delivered the pictures to
                    the press, to television, to everybody.</p>
                <p>After Bill Clark left and I was acting PAO, Bernie Anderson came over with the
                    news that President Johnson was raising the ante in Vietnam, and gave us the
                    figures. I think the final troop total reached something like 485,000. But
                    Bernie was informing the intelligence people on the information side of the
                    foreign office of what was going to happen. Bernie and I went there and met with
                    them. That was kind of the peak, of course, of our participation in troop
                    strength, at least, in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that? It must have been about '65 or
                        '66.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Must have been.</p>
                <p>The job in London was interesting. Bill Clark was very skilled in dealing with
                    the British press, and we had a good information staff. I think probably Bill's
                    major contribution in London was in briefing the diplomatic and defense
                    correspondents with tremendous assistance from Jim Pettis, the press
                    attach�.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>My job was essentially to keep the office operating. I was more the operating
                    person, but I did have some interesting assignments. If you're a deputy PAO, as
                    you know, it's pretty hard for you to get into the program substance in the
                    country you're in because there are other people on the staff who are expressly
                    assigned for that purpose. So your function is auxiliary. Important as it may
                    be, it tends to be auxiliary. It's to assist the other members of the staff,
                    your PAO and the people under him, to get the job done.</p>
                <p>But one of the interesting jobs I had was liaison with the British-American
                    Parliamentary Group. This was essentially an organization intended to give
                    hospitality and substantive assistance and information to visiting U. S.
                    congressmen and senators in Parliament. I was the embassy's liaison with the
                    organization that handled it for Parliament. It gave me many opportunities to
                    meet Parliamentarians, to tour the Parliament over and over again, and to attend
                    various functions held for visiting American politicians.</p>
                <p>Occasionally some funny things would happen. Jesse Unruh, who was at that time
                    the speaker in the California State Assembly, and George Miller, president
                    pro-tem of the California Senate, came over and they were given the same
                    courtesies as if they had been members of Congress. I was helping them. I took
                    them up to the House, and they were met by Lord Henderson, a salty old boy who
                    was liked very much, who undertook to guide them through the House of Lords
                    himself. So I went tagging along. They're standing around admiring this
                    extremely handsome room and all its beautiful red and gold, and I heard Jesse
                    Unruh say to George Miller, “We ought to fix our joint up like this.”
                    (Laughs)</p>
                <p>And a couple of years ago, I was in Sacramento, where they have in recent years
                    restored the fine old capital building and re-done all the rooms. And sure
                    enough, the Senate (the Upper House) was in red and gold! (Laughs) Jesse Unruh,
                    by that time, was state treasurer. He was still a powerful man behind the
                    scenes. I'm certain that when they started to refurbish that chamber, that Jesse
                    had a hand in “fixing up the joint.”</p>
                <p>I was also the USIS and, in several bodies, the ambassador's representative to
                    various organizations. Anyone who has been a DPAO knows how such assignments are
                    acquired; USIS officers with more specific duties dodge them on the grounds that
                    the job description doesn't prescribe them, and the DPAO's perceived generalist
                    function makes him vulnerable.</p>
                <p>There were three quasi-governmental and private NATO-support organizations, a
                    Foreign Office American Section, the English Speaking Union, a semi-official
                    British-American teachers exchange project, a private student exchange
                    organization, and numerous other societies, groups and boards in which I either
                    represented USIS or Ambassador Bruce. I was also probably the most called-upon
                    USIS officer for public speaking, usually to school, college or educator groups,
                    sometimes to civic or foreign study groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Clark studiously avoided USIS administration, handing that entire responsibility
                    to me. This is a proper function for a DPAO; the PAO should not have to tussle
                    with budget, personnel and office management. I was fortunate to have excellent
                    British staff in this area. All in all, the London job was both demanding and
                    rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave your assignment to London, I'd like to ask
                        a couple of questions, because this was one of the two times when all the
                        rage was to create a country plan with specific objectives, and you were
                        supposed to report your accomplishment with regard to your advance toward
                        the accomplishment of objectives. I'd like to know whether you even
                        attempted to handle your program in that way, or whether you were mainly
                        reacting to the principal problems that came up, such as the Cuban Missile
                        Crisis, and things of that nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Maybe the country plan method had its uses. I suppose everybody ought
                    to be compelled to sit down and examine what they're doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I had to write the country plan in London. Bill Clark had no interest
                    in it; thought it unnecessary. I must have rewritten it four or five times,
                    trying to satisfy Bob Lincoln, who would then reiterate what he thought the
                    country plan ought to be, although he'd never served in Britain. You finally get
                    to the point that all you're trying to do is satisfy Washington, and get on with
                    what you see as really important. The country plan gets to be a terrible
                    nuisance, it's a very time-consuming thing, you spend hours, days, months,
                    trying to satisfy preconceptions of Washington. Now, this may not be true in
                    many instances, but it seems to me that's the way it affected me in London,
                    where, as they do in any important post, politics and international affairs are
                    changing constantly. It seems to me that the country plan system is therefore
                    often a failure, not for any particular inabilities of the people who are trying
                    to devise it, but because it just becomes an attempt to produce the right string
                    of words to satisfy somebody else.</p>
                <p>Certainly every USIS post should address assiduously to what it should be doing
                    to maintain and advance the interests of the United States, hopefully under the
                    guidance of intelligent and informed Washington leadership. But I was never
                    comfortable with country planning which went beyond thoughtful examination of
                    the host country's basic attitudes toward the U.S. and the structural
                    application of USIA's resources to nudge those attitudes toward favor for
                    long-range American objectives. We too often pursued short-range objectives with
                    pushy, campaign-like efforts.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Two notable characteristics have flawed the leadership of the agency and
                    contributed to this penchant. Hardly any agency director, from Compton to Wick,
                    (Ed Murrow excepted.) came in to the job after having spent significant time
                    abroad. It is unlikely that anyone who has not had extended residence in a
                    foreign country can head USIA with understanding of its mission and its
                    capabilities and limitations. Secondly, it is virtually impossible to plan, and
                    to measure dependably, the enduring success, if any, of USIS programs. Only with
                    the greatest sense of reality should any USIS practitioner set out to alter host
                    country attitudes with the expectation of being, at best, more than a small
                    element in the tangle of influences.</p>
                <p>Some proclamations of goals have been ludicrous: the announcement of Doctor
                    “Bloodshot” that the agency should make every human being on earth a
                    card-carrying Christian was a nutty extension of such nonsense.</p>
                <p>Often a false fervor has been encouraged by USIA leaders, cranking up spurious
                    activity by executives who felt pressed to show progress toward solving the
                    insoluble and convincing the unconvincible. Country plans have tended in some
                    instances to be documents prepared mainly to satisfy the need in Washington to
                    demonstrate that USIA was shrewdly identifying our objectives, and, with equal
                    shrewdness, moving to achieve them. Too often, that was eyewash.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether country plans are still used, but there must be some process
                    that would do this better. One of the problems with satisfying the overall
                    objectives of an agency like USIA is the constant change of country
                    circumstances. Situations change more rapidly and more frequently than in almost
                    any other civilian agency of government, except for the State Department itself.
                    I think this makes it very difficult to try to set down in concrete some kind of
                    plan that's supposed to last you a year or two years or something.</p>
                <p>Later I spent two and a half years in Manila as head of RSC, and I've left out
                    that portion of this thing, which probably is worth examining. There I was not a
                    part of USIS Manila. I was reporting directly to Washington, and I wasn't
                    concerned with country plans. I was welcome; I always attended the USIS and the
                    ambassador's staff meetings every week in the embassy, and got on well. We had
                    quite an integrated operation, I guess, with Manila, but I was no more
                    responsible to them than I was to the embassy in Bangkok or Rangoon or
                    Singapore, wherever.</p>
                <p>In New Zealand, I don't recall that we were pressed to wrestle with the country
                    plan the way we were in London.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think part of the problem in London, as it was not only
                        with London, but with all of Western Europe, was the fact that your time in
                        London happened to coincide with a time when Tom Sorensen felt that Western
                        Europe was greatly over-funded, it was headed by a bunch of effete thinkers
                        who had previously been riding a gravy train left over from the days of
                        OMGUS, HICOG, and the Marshall Plan. All European types, in his estimation,
                        should be transferred elsewhere, and Washington should virtually dismantle
                        the European Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: They almost did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He felt it was just superfluous, and that USIA was just
                        feeding the ego's of a bunch of people who had been exchanging posts in
                        Europe. I had headed a team in early 1963, which was sent over to try to
                        reduce the European program. It was made very clear to me by Tom that they
                        wanted to practically dismantle it. I went over, and we made a very
                        intensive study, and we came back with a program which all four of us who
                        were members of that party agreed was a fairly substantial reduction in the
                        European program, but one that would not cripple the program. Sorensen was
                        completely unsatisfied with that, and told me that we didn't do half the
                        job. Later he made Bob Lincoln head of the European area, with the express
                        purpose of cutting down to the point where he thought it ought to be. I
                        think that's why you had so much trouble with the country plan, more than
                        anything else, in all probability.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: As a matter of fact, Bill Clark had left, gone back to Washington. I
                    was acting PAO when suddenly, with very little — we knew the philosophy that was
                    going on, and we knew the attitude that was pressing on Europe. That had been
                    clear for a long time. But suddenly in August, I was given a sharply reduced
                    budget right then. Bang! We weren't waiting for next year. Funds were cut off. I
                    had to call the local staff together and tell them that a lot of them were going
                    to lose their jobs. I told them what the pressure was on this thing, and I said,
                    “If any of you have been contemplating retirement or any shifts of position,
                    please do it now and save somebody else who's going to get the sack if you hang
                    on just a short time more.” I talked this over very candidly with the whole
                    staff, exactly what we were up against, how much we had to cut, and I think I
                    had to fire something like 14 people out of a total staff of 38. I'm not sure
                    those figures are right. It was in that range. They had to be off the payroll
                    almost immediately, because my budget year was coming to an end. If they didn't
                    get off, it would start kind of an automatic triggering, you see. It would
                    liquidate us.</p>
                <p>There were two other factors involved in this operation. Bob Lincoln was one, who
                    seemed utterly unsympathetic on this score. The ambassador contributed to it —
                    David Bruce — because the ambassador had the old-fashioned idea, although he and
                    Bill Clark always got on very well, that there were a lot of unnecessary
                    functions, you know. He had the old idea of kind of a Jeffersonian attitude
                    toward diplomacy. He supported the idea of cutting USIA, without consulting
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>He went off on leave down in the south of France somewhere, just on a holiday for
                    a week or something or other, when this word came through to cut. Phil Kaiser,
                    who was then deputy chief of mission, acceded to the thing in a message back to
                    Washington, without consulting me. I was roaring mad about it. I had know Phil
                    from an earlier day when he was Assistant Secretary of Labor, way back under
                    Maurice Tobin. I was in a rage about it because he had made the decision in
                    Bruce's absence, and without consulting me. I didn't even see the incoming
                    message. I turned around and wrote my own roaring mad message back to
                    Washington, saying how outrageous this thing was, at least in the way it was
                    being handled, and that we hadn't been consulted on it at all, it had just been
                    done summarily between Lincoln's office and the ambassador's office. That was a
                    hell of a way to operate. But we had to do it, and we had to cut the staff. We
                    had to fire some of the best people, locals, in USIS London. It was really
                    savage. But we did it.</p>
                <p>I learned later on — well, forget that, because people are still around. But I
                    learned some interesting background in that thing that concerned the attitudes
                    before and after this happened. I think there were some regrets on it,
                    probably.</p>
                <p>I guess we ought to say something about RSC Manila, because it's an important
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Assignment As Director, Regional Service Center Manila 1966-68</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the years that you were in Manila?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I went to Manila in early 1966. I came back from London, and there was
                    no job for me. I'm sure this happens lots of times to people coming back from
                    overseas. But here I'd been in a responsible job, I'd been acting PAO London,
                    which is not peanuts in the agency, and had been asked to stay on in London
                    while there was this transition from Bill Clark to somebody else. It turned out
                    to be Bill King, who arrived sick and left sick. A bad appointment. Alienated
                    himself from everybody in the embassy, I guess, but he was not well and didn't
                    do anything.</p>
                <p>When I came back, nobody had any suggestions on what I was to do. This is one of
                    the great faults in the agency, I think, its inability to consult with and plan
                    ahead for returning personnel you sometimes get terribly disconnected, as you
                    know, from your own country, let alone your own agency, when you're serving
                    abroad. So I'd been over there four years without leave, four long years away
                    from the United States, quite happy with it, but you get really badly out of
                    communication with everything. I'd lost all touch with the levers of power in
                    Washington and so on. There ought to be a better way to handle this thing. Maybe
                    there is now. With all the talk about career planning, it never seemed to me
                    that it really got very far.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So I had to go around, trying to find a job. I went back to Jim Thomas, who
                    worked for me for years and years, and who was very shrewd and experienced in
                    bureaucracy. Jim said, “We're going to need somebody in RSC Manila. Would you
                    like to go there?” The Philippines didn't particularly appeal to me, but I
                    finally realized I had to do something, and I took the job. I went to Manila. It
                    was a satisfying job in many ways. My wife was unhappy in that climate. It was
                    very hard on her. It wasn't so hard on me, but it's not the greatest place to
                    be, and it's probably far worse now than it was then. But the job at RSC itself
                    was a satisfying job. There was lots to do there, I thought, in terms of
                    straightening out things that had gotten kind of slack before I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had preceded you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I can't think of his name. Nice guy. I suppose everybody thinks that
                    he can move into a new job and do it better than any guy that was ahead of him.
                    But this was during the tremendous build-up of propaganda for Vietnam. Although
                    we were publishing and printing enormous quantities of what you might think of
                    as the usual material for USIS posts all over Southeast Asia and, to some
                    extent, to other parts of the world, the program was essentially for the
                    military or for that combined operation that Barry Zorthian had, over there in
                    Vietnam, built up to huge proportions. We were printing textbooks in Vietnamese,
                    Laos and all kinds of exotic languages. We didn't handle the languages
                    ourselves; the copy came in for our camera, all ready to go. But we were
                    reproducing, for a while, in maybe 20 languages. We were turning out the largest
                    magazine in Asia at one time, Free World, and later changed to another name, I
                    forget, Horizons? I don't know. I forget. Anyway, a really handsome, four-color
                    magazine with special editions for, I think, 11 different countries, enormous
                    quantities of posters and pamphlets and whatnot.</p>
                <p>But for Vietnam, it became a leaflet operation, essentially, in addition to these
                    huge quantities of school books. Finally, we were shipping two 707 plane loads
                    every three days of printed material to Vietnam, right out of Clark Air Base. We
                    were running three shifts 24 hours a day, while having terrible problems with
                    salt water invading our wells and affecting our photo developing, our
                    air-conditioning breaking down at a time when using printing paper has to have
                    stable humidity, all kinds of problems, running day and night. We used, in the
                    last year I was there, 14 million pounds of paper. We met our obligations on it.
                    It was a hell of an operation. I think I had 350-450 employees, almost all
                    Filipinos, some American staff.</p>
                <p>One of the stalwarts of that operation was Al Roland, who came back to run the
                    publications division at IPS, a really fine magazine editor. The printing side
                    was Werner Sauer and later Norbert Marcian. We were turning out quite
                    high-quality printing in just tremendous quantities.</p>
                <p>Hutchison Goes To New Zealand As PAO: 1968</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I left there when the PAO Wellington died of a heart attack. I can't remember his
                    name at the moment, Jerry somebody. He was somebody I hadn't known
                    personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody I knew, too, and I can't think now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I never actually knew him. I met him once at a PAO meeting somewhere.
                    When I heard that post was open, I wrote back to Dan Oleksiw, who was then head
                    of East Asia and Pacific Area, and told him I would like to go down there, and I
                    wrote back to Jim Thomas. I'd been his supervisor for years, and at this point
                    he was my supervisor when I was at RSC Manila. I wrote to Jim. So Jim and Dan
                    worked it out, and I went down to New Zealand for two tours, four years in
                    all.</p>
                <p>Some curious things happened in the agency that I think are worth mentioning.
                    They are negative, but I think they belong in something like this. You may
                    recall that the agency produced a film called “The Silent Majority.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: This was sent to us in New Zealand, and we were under instructions to
                    get the widest possible distribution and so on. I had to look at it in our
                    little viewing room with a couple of my local employees. It was a patchwork of
                    old documentary stuff designed to show that the American people really did
                    support the Vietnam War, in spite of everything you've heard. It was so patently
                    fake, that after we ran it, I said to this gal who handled broadcasting (we were
                    supposed to get this on NZBC), “Do not under any circumstances take that up
                    there. We'll just be ridiculed out of town. Don't do anything with it. Put it on
                    a shelf.” And we didn't do anything with it. We never let it see the light of
                    day. I thought it would be a disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Bruce Herschensohn was the producer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I'm getting to him. Yes, he was. I went to a PAO meeting in Manila.

                <p>HUTCHISON: You might remember this. Jack Zeller, who lives over here in Santa

                <p>HUTCHISON: Jack was at the meeting, because he remembers the meeting that I'm
                    talking about, and I don't remember the year. It seems to me it might have been
                    later than '70. I think so. (It was. Either in 1971 or '72.) It had to be later,
                    because that picture hadn't been made in '70. I think it must have been '72.</p>
                <p>At one of the alumni luncheons here recently, like the one at which you spoke,
                    Jack Zeller, whom I never knew, introduced himself. He reminded me of the
                    incident at the PAO meeting in Manila. I didn't know Herschensohn from Adam's
                    house cat. He initiated a discussion around the room, asking each country, each
                    PAO, how he had used the film. When it came to my turn, I said, “I took a spade
                    and buried it in the alley.”</p>
                <p>I don't remember how long later, some time later, I got a letter from Henry
                    Loomis, when he was deputy to Shakespeare, telling me that I was going to be
                    separated from the agency unless I shaped up. I forget what the language was,
                    but that's what it amounted to. It really jolted me, because I had an absolutely
                    unblemished record with USIA, and plenty of commendations to vouch for it. I
                    really was shaken and furious. I didn't connect it with the Manila meeting. I
                    didn't know what had happened. I hadn't the foggiest idea what could have
                    triggered this.</p>
                <p>I had been through a State Department inspection, in which they also inspected
                    USIA as a kind of corollary, got a glowing report, I'd had a fine report on my
                    last USIS inspection in Manila, a glowing report. So I had nothing in the record
                    that I knew about that could have caused this, and I didn't connect it with
                    Manila at all. I didn't know what the inside was at Washington at the time.</p>
                <p>Kent Crane was, had for a while, replaced Oleksiw as Director for East Asia and
                    the Pacific Area, including New Zealand and Australia. Kent Crane came in to
                    Wellington. I remember we were kind of joggled when he was appointed, because he
                    had no apparent qualifications for this, and he came out of the Spiro Agnew
                    organization. So we were all really kind of disturbed when we heard he'd been
                    appointed. I'm still not sure that he had any great qualifications for the job.
                    But he came through, he was very nice. We got on fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very intelligent fellow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Seemed to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Extremely right wing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I suppose so. Crane was on a kind of inspection tour of his own, and I
                    set up some meetings for him in Wellington. In fact, I set up a big party for
                    him, at which he met every important person in New Zealand, because my contacts
                    were very good. I took him down to Christ Church to meet editors and so on, on
                    the south island. I thought, “Well, I can't fight this thing from here. I don't
                    know what to do. Here Crane is my superior in this hierarchy. I'll just take my
                    file along.”</p>
                <p>On the plane I handed him the file with that letter from Loomis on top of it. I
                    handed him my file of commendations, which was really good, solid documentation.
                    And in the hour or so it took us to fly down, he read through this whole thing
                    very carefully, and he said to me, “I don't understand this at all. I don't see
                    how it could happen on the basis of your record as you've got it right here.” He
                    didn't promise anything, but he gave me the impression he would look into it
                    when he got back to Washington. This must have been in 1972.</p>
                <p>About six months later, I was given a superior award, a silver medal, the usual
                    diploma from Shakespeare. (Laughs) Now, how do you...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He never ordered you separated after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: No! No. I can't attribute this to anybody but Kent Crane. He's the
                    only person I took it up with. I can only guess or assume that he did take this
                    back to Washington and said, “Let's do some justice here.” (Laughs) I don't see
                    any other answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason that I thought it might have been 1970 is
                        because at that time, Henry Loomis had apparently been told by Shakespeare
                        that the agency was overstaffed, and I don't know whether Henry was the
                        originator of the project, or whether he was doing it on the orders of Frank
                        Shakespeare, but they set out to separate about 150 people from the agency.
                        A committee was established on which were sitting Ken Bunce, Barbara White
                        and I've forgotten who the other members of the committee were. They were
                        asked to review every file of every senior officer in the agency, and they
                        came up, finally, with a list of about 80 people that they thought might be
                        separated because their records weren't quite as good as others, although
                        they still were good records, but the committee had to find a certain number
                        of people. They submitted it to Henry, and I'm advised by someone that they
                        were told this was not enough, and to go back to the drawing board.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>This happened a second time, and the ultimate result was that about 150 people
                    were selected out on the basis of this review, many of them with very excellent
                    records. A few of them appealed, without success. Finally, one of them, Fred
                    Dickens, spent six years preparing his case, presenting it, appealing it, and
                    finally the agency was forced to reinstate him. He got all his back pay! He got
                    his annuity increased as if he had been employed all through those years, and
                    they had to pay him everything back from the time of his separation to the date
                    of his restoration. But he's the only person who ever won a case like that. I
                    remember that I testified on his behalf when he was bringing the case. Since I
                    knew about this enforced “selection out” process going on in 1970, I thought
                    your problem might have occurred at that time.</p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I don't think so. This was later. This had to be later. It had to be.
                    I must say I had known Henry when he was in the Voice, when I was heading IPS
                    and so on, and although we never were close in operation or personally, we
                    always got on well. This was a very legalistic letter, which said, in effect,
                    “Either shape up or ship out,” as if I had to correct things I was doing wrong,
                    and yet I had excellent relations with — I had no supervisor in Wellington who
                    could have complained about me. I was on good relations with the embassy itself,
                    we got on well. And I'm quite confident that there was nobody operating against
                    my interests in the embassy. I have no suspicion whatever.</p>
                <p>Here's this very involved language that seemed to have been devised carefully by
                    the agency lawyers or something, you know. On the bottom of it, in a little
                    handwritten note, Henry wrote, “I'm sorry about this, Hutch.” The inference I
                    took from that was that this was a perfunctory document which he had to sign
                    just because he was the signing officer, and it certainly suggested that he
                    regretted it and that he hadn't has a part in it himself. It wasn't a personal
                    letter; it was a very legalistic letter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very possible that Herschensohn brought this up with
                        Shakespeare.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: By now, having learned later on what kind of a guy he is, I'm quite
                    confident that's what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You remember that he ran for senator two years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes. Didn't get anywhere.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Wellington your last post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes. I retired in 1973. You see, I was a reserve officer, and I had
                    qualified for career. You will recall that along about 1967, I suppose it was,
                    when I was in Manila, I got one of those formal invitations to accept a career
                    appointment, but with the option to continue as a reserve officer and thereby be
                    able to stay until age 62, instead of retiring at age 60. At that point, as much
                    as I would have enjoyed the career status, it served my personal interests much
                    better to continue my reserve appointment and to get the extra two years,
                    because I was approaching retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your main program thrusts in New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: New Zealand is a country that is very responsive to the American
                    culture and American objectives. Forget this nuclear hassle that's going on now.
                    To put it in simplest terms, so friendly, that it didn't seem to me that a
                    contrived country plan was suitable to the job in New Zealand. It seemed to me
                    the thing to do in New Zealand — this is what I acted upon all the time I was
                    there — was to introduce New Zealanders as much as possible to what's going on
                    in the United States and what Americans are like, and if you accomplished that,
                    that in itself was a country plan. I traveled that country from hell to
                    breakfast. I made hundreds of speeches, I showed films, I developed all kinds of
                    homemade programs which had as their real purpose, not the program itself, but
                    the introduction of Americans and American thought to New Zealanders. So my
                    principal interest was in devices which would establish more and more of this
                    contact. I think I succeeded in it.</p>
                <p>Dean Koch succeeded me. I think he really was astonished. He came down to take
                    over while I was still there. (I think that's something the agency ought to
                    strive to do as often as they possibly can. It doesn't always happen, but it
                    should any time it's possible at all, assuming that the incoming guy and the
                    outgoing guy are compatible or reasonably polite.) So when Dean arrived, I put
                    on, in effect, a reception for him that really, I think, kind of knocked him
                    out, because he met every important person in Wellington at that thing. I think
                    I had developed relationships with them that were almost on a family basis. It's
                    that kind of a country. People like to say New Zealand is a country built on a
                    human scale, and that's a very good description of it. Everybody knows everybody
                    else.</p>
                <p>I said, “There are three gentlemen over here I want you to meet,” all elderly men
                    sitting against the wall, not the kind of people that feel like getting up and
                    circulating, nor did they have to. I can't remember their names at this point,
                    but one was a former air marshal of the New Zealand Air Force; one was the head
                    of their scientific establishment and world renowned scholar; and one was a
                    retired high court judge. And every one was a knight. They were all “Sir this”
                    and “Sir that,” you know. So I took Dean over and said, “These are three people
                    you must meet.” They were really topnotch gentlemen as personalities and really
                    distinguished New Zealanders. So I introduced him to all these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Later on in the evening, one of these men, with whom I was especially good
                    friends, a very dignified old boy, he said, “I'll bet your friend never had
                    three knights stand up for him before.” (Laughs)</p>
                <p>It was a very satisfying post, and I think in that kind country, there's an
                    attitude that doesn't fit anywhere else that I can think of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might in Australia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Possibly Australia, yes. Australia's still a big, scattered country,
                    you know, whereas New Zealand's quite compact. My method for New Zealand
                    certainly is not a policy, if it deserves the word policy, it's not a policy
                    that you can pursue at all in a country of a different language. It certainly is
                    not one that you can pursue in a country which has lots of hostilities or
                    opposition to the American policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you have factions that are either pro-communist or
                        anti-U.S.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes. So I wouldn't recommend that way to operate anywhere else I can
                    think of, but I think that was the way to do it there. It's a homey country. At
                    the same time, they are sensitive to any feeling that they're being
                    propagandized, and quick to recognize it. It's a highly literate country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say about your total career in the agency?
                        Would you say it, on the whole, was a very satisfying one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Oh, yes. It was relatively short, much shorter than yours. I guess I
                    spent two and a half years after I came from Paris, from a different agency, in
                    the agency, and resigned. Then went back and spent another four years in London,
                    two and a half in Manila, four years — another 11 years, which isn't very long
                    in comparison with lots of career people. But of course, I went in through
                    so-called lateral entry. I think it was very satisfying. I think it's an agency
                    that has been exasperating to almost anybody who's ever served in it, and I
                    think it's an agency which is absolutely unique in its objectives. I think it's
                    an agency which has, given some exceptions, I think, has had a remarkable number
                    of dedicated, energetic, intelligent, hard working people.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>It has seemed to me that USIA has had a remarkable proportion of talented,
                    effective, very hardworking operators in spite of the too many occasions on
                    which it has had very poor leadership at the top — people imposed on it by new
                    administrations which either used the agency as a handy place to take care of
                    political cronies, or to send in “new brooms” to carry out ideological house
                    cleanings. Such appointees have usually arrived with preconceptions of the
                    agency that were prejudiced or even contemptuous, believing USIA to be a nest of
                    impractical, inefficient bureaucrats who need guidance from hard-headed experts
                    from the field of public relations or advertising or the media. The reality
                    however is that the appropriate training for a director of USIA would be to have
                    learned its policies and techniques in years of service in USIA. Its mission,
                    and the methods and attitudes which it must have if it is to succeed are unique,
                    in or out of government.</p>
                <p>I can count on one hand, with fingers left over, the few USIA directors whom I
                    can call genuinely qualified, unselfish and dedicated. Almost all others have
                    been either fools, ideologues, political choices, or figureheads manipulated by
                    scheming underlings. I have often marveled at the capacity of the career staff
                    to keep USIA operating as well as it has done, given the quality of its
                    directors.</p>
                <p>I'll be specific: Compton and Johnson certainly were fools. Larson, Shakespeare
                    and Wick qualify as ideologues. I have little basis to judge Marks or Rowan,
                    although they were named for political reasons. Murrow's appointment was the
                    product of the mutual fascination between him and John Kennedy, and he was a
                    manipulated symbol, not a hands-on director. Sorensen and Wilson, men of immense
                    ego and meager expertise, abused USIA and used Murrow. Said Sorensen to Bill
                    Clark during a visit to London, “Ed and Don and I are the Troika.”</p>
                <p>I think back over the people I've known in it, and it was especially painful, it
                    seemed to me, to see it go through the occasional ideological upheavals —
                    especially the McCarthy thing was the worse — because it was so full of
                    patriots. Really, one of the characteristics, it seems to me at the agency, is
                    that in the true sense, it was full of patriots, and not the kind of patriots
                    that McCarthy was hollering about or that Dan Quayle or a lot of people might
                    today, certainly not the kind of patriots Reagan defines at all. Real patriots,
                    many of them very innovative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of them are tremendously innovative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes. When you think that a public affairs officer and his staff in
                    almost any country is operating a program pretty much on his own to represent
                    the United States abroad, to that country, it's an enormous responsibility, and
                    I never met anybody in the agency who wasn't trying hard to do that. I might
                    have disagreed with how they were going about it or whether they were really
                    competent themselves or not, but in most cases, really fine people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know what the situation is in the agency today,
                        but I think that everybody in our time believed so thoroughly in what it was
                        trying to do, and was so convinced that there was a role for it to play,
                        that there was a great dedication and feeling of camaraderie in the
                        organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Oh, yes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which I think has diminished very substantially over the
                        last few years. There was a period in the earlier years when there was much
                        more possibility of free-wheeling than there is today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Communications have placed Washington so close to the
                        field, that both the ambassador and the head of any of the programs under
                        the embassy have to look over their shoulders at Washington much more
                        carefully than they did then. So I think we've lost some of that
                        free-wheeling, enterprising spirit that we had, and with it, I think we have
                        lost some of the esprit de corps. But maybe I'm wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I think you're right. I remember in Wellington, we got this
                    instruction, this must have been about 1971, '72, we got an administrative
                    instruction which required us to keep theseelaborate records on all of our
                    budgeting and programs, big long tables that you filled out and so on. I sent a
                    message back to the agency, pointing out that we were only two Americans. We
                    only had seven people. And that this was a tremendous burden in terms of our
                    time, to maintain this kind of record and attempt to allocate budget when all
                    seven of us knew exactly where every nickel went, and that this kind of
                    programming for a post of that size didn't seem to me to be efficient or useful.
                    I said in these words, “I would request that a post like ours be allowed to
                    continue to fly by the seat of its pants.”</p>
                <p>I got back a very cold instruction which said, in effect, “Get on with it. Do it
                    like we told you.” So we had to. But I think in an earlier day, there would have
                    been a little better tolerance. Of course, it's a part of bureaucracy. It's
                    often difficult for bureaucrats to depart from their regulations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has become much more bureaucratic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I'm sure it has. The enormous advances with technology, in terms of
                    sending information and live televisions interchange between, say, news
                    correspondents in one country and politicians in this one, these must have an
                    enormous effect on the operation of posts now, and probably has little relation
                    to what I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The programs as we used to run them are changed almost
                        unrecognizably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I'm sure they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are at least 40 posts, now with which the agency has
                        an instantaneous television interchange or computer inter change of
                        information.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: And facsimile and all the new...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that you never had before. The wireless file is
                        practically passe now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: I'd like to talk a little bit about the wireless file, by the way.
                    When I joined the agency in 1952, the wireless file was still sent by Morse code
                    to human operators, Americans, who were sent around the world to sit in these
                    cubbyholes and receive Morse code, sent to them dot and dash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Something that a lot of people nowadays never even heard of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: These operators were getting scarce. It was hard to find telegraphers
                    who would take these jobs overseas. It was hard to find telegraphers who didn't
                    have proclivities that weren't really compatible with life abroad. Sometime when
                    I was in the agency — when was Andy Beding the deputy director? He was for a
                    while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was back about 1954 and/or 1955. He then went over to
                        the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Yes, for John Foster Dulles. It had to be '54, because I left at the
                    end of '54. Jim Thomas and I had been trying for a long time to get the budget
                    to include a substantial amount of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars,
                    which would have been millions today, to change over from Morse code to radio
                    teletype. Radio teletype , modern then, is outdated and outmoded today; that's
                    now an old-fashioned way to send it. But I had been fighting for this because I
                    could see it had to come. After all, lots of people were using radio teletype
                    overseas in those days commercially, and still the agency was pounding iron, as
                    they say, a slow laborious, expensive way to do it, and full of all kinds of
                    errors and whatnot.</p>
                <p>At a budget meeting, you may have even been there at the time. I can't remember
                    if you were head of administration then or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was head of administration from 1960 to '64. I came in
                        in July of '60 after I got out of the National War College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: This was considerably earlier. Andy Beding was conducting the weekly
                    staff meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was still in Japan then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Everybody was fighting for chunks of the budget, and I made a last
                    desperate pitch to get started on radio teletype transmission of the wireless
                    file. I had the figures for it. I had worked out exactly what it would cost and
                    so on. Jim Thomas had done a good job on all that. I said, “At least let's start
                    for Europe.” And Andy finally said, “Okay, let's start it for Europe.” And
                    that's how the wireless file moved from dot and dash to radio teletype.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yesterday I was interviewing Harry Kendall, and he was an
                        assistant information officer. He had learned the Morse code when he was in
                        the military. Therefore, part of his duty at his post was to receive the
                        wireless file in Morse code.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: He used to be in Kuala Lumpur, but that [his use of Morse code for the
                    wireless file] must have been before that at an earlier post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do thank you very much, John. It has been a very useful
                        interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUTCHISON: Glad to do it.</p>
