                <p>SUSAN DAY</p>
                <p>Interviewed By: Joan Bartlett</p>
                <p>Initial Interview Date: July 13, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Susan, could we start with a little bit of your
                        background: where you were born, grew up, met your husband, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: I was born in Burlington, Vermont and grew up mostly in upper New York
                    state, and then went back to Vermont to go to the University of Vermont. I met
                    my husband in high school and then right after college we were married and went
                    almost directly into the Foreign Service. We were both, I think, twenty-three
                    when we went into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know that he had that in mind when you got
                        married? Was it a joint decision? Were you interested in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: I think it was just one of those things that developed when he left school.
                    It seemed interesting; and it was a job. We started off by moving to Washington
                    for three months for language training and then we went to Naples in November of
                    1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you both have language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have children then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. I had a baby just before we went to Washington; she was nine months old
                    when we went to Naples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have full day Italian training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DAY: No. I think it was two hours a day in Washington and then when we got to
                    Italy I continued language training—one hour a day, five days a week for a year
                    or two years. We did pretty well. Italian isn't that difficult a language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That baby must have been much admired in Naples. Was she
                        very blond like you and John?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, she was. I think the most difficult thing in Naples was trying to find
                    a place to live. I can still remember some of the weird places we were shown.
                    Somebody had called in about an apartment in an old building in the Vomero high
                    in the hills, and the Consul General wanted me to check it out. So I went up
                    there with the driver. We went into this huge stone villa and up to about the
                    third floor, and we were walking around when all of a sudden the corridor just
                    sort of stopped and there was rubble on the floor. The ceiling was about four
                    feet high, and we crawled through. We eventually regained the corridor and we
                    ended up asking directions from some old lady in an apartment that was being
                    visited by nuns. Anyway, it was a strange experience. Needless to say, we didn't
                    end up living there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they didn't have any apartments for the Consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: They had apartments in the Consulate building. There was one good size one
                    that was occupied and then there were a couple of smaller ones with one bedroom.
                    We finally found an apartment and moved in on the first of January—all our
                    furniture had gotten delayed somehow. It was so cold. All of the rooms had
                    fourteen foot ceilings, and you could see the light under the doors—about an
                    inch of daylight. It was cold! The next year they put in central heat, but
                    meanwhile we had only two kerosene heaters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have someone to help you in the house and with the
                        baby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. But we went through about nine maids until we found somebody
                    satisfactory. It wasn't the fact that you had so much housework, it was that you
                    had to have somebody there when you went out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a pretty active social life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. It was only ten years after World War II and the visa section was
                    enormous—there was a large refugee relief program—so there were a lot of
                    Americans there. We were also very friendly with the Italians—there were
                    particularly nice people who worked at the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Two and a half. Then we had a direct transfer to The Hague. We went there in
                    1958. We were there two years with a home leave in between—which was
                    horrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about home leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: We had to go home and there we were with a three-year-old and a baby and no
                    place to go. We weren't able to afford to go anyplace on our own. We ended up at
                    my parents and they didn't enjoy it any more than we did. It was just hard for a
                    two month stretch. A few days would have been all right. We visited around as
                    much as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then back to The Hague? Was that a nice post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: It was a nice post, very nice. It rained a lot, but it was close to things,
                    places to visit. We went to Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, London, back to Italy
                    to visit. So we liked it.</p>
                <p>Then one day we got a telegram transferring us to Lyon. This was about two weeks
                    after we had gotten settled in our house, and I guess we just kind of turned it
                    down. It would have been a nice post to go to, we would have liked to, but we
                    had just gotten moved. So, Sydney went to a Dutch kindergarten and that was very
                    nice. She picked up Dutch in six weeks—it took me considerably longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take lessons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, and actually I took French lessons there, too, feeling that Dutch was
                    so limited. Then we went back to Washington for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a house in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No. We didn't have anything at that point. We rented in Washington, but it
                    was at this time that we bought this house in New Hampshire. We had tried to buy
                    a house in Washington, but it didn't work out, so we ended up buying this place,
                    which was a much better buy. It was in John's family and we bought it from his
                    aunt. At that time these houses were going for very little—that was in 1963. So
                    from then on for home leaves we had a place to go to. But everybody came to
                    visit us—I'm not sure which was worse! All the family would come to see us, so
                    it wasn't very restful. I felt like I was running an inn—washing sheets, cooking
                    big meals.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do a lot of entertaining in Holland? What was
                        John's position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: He was in the political section. At that time the U.S. had a World Court
                    case—I've forgotten the details—but I do remember one day we entertained the
                    entire World Court at a cocktail party—which was a highlight of my life. John
                    was doing the liaison with The Court. Wellington Koo was a member of the Court
                    at that time—a Chinese diplomat of the old school. But actually it was a very
                    easy group of about fifteen or twenty, and some of the local people as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do your own cooking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Not for parties. I did for every day. Big cocktail parties we had
                    catered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you swim in the North Sea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Occasionally. It was cold. We'd go to the beach, but the wind would blow so,
                    we couldn't sit around.</p>
                <p>While in The Hague we were presented to Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhardt. The
                    entire diplomatic corps drove from The Hague to the palace in Amsterdam on New
                    Year's Day. The reception was held at noon, and after we had bowed, curtsied and
                    wished their Majesties Happy New Year, we were served a cup of bouillon and
                    returned home. This presentation followed several meetings of the wives at which
                    we were instructed how to curtsy and how to dress. One had to wear a formal
                    short dress with long sleeves. Black was not allowed and hats were mandatory. I
                    still have my gorgeous red velvet hat I wore on that occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to know people from other embassies in The
                        Hague?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. We belonged to a junior diplomats group that met about once a month and
                    we did quite a few interesting trips—visiting the dykes, going down coal mines,
                    things like that. It was a good group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after that, it was back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. We brought back a Dutch girl who worked for us and I went to work to
                    pay her salary. She eventually moved on—she went back to Holland and then came
                    back to the States—to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your children then were how old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: One in second grade, one in kindergarten and then Christina was born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of work did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: I was a secretary. I worked at American University. I got paid the grand sum
                    of about $5000 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you live?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: In Washington northwest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much to do with the State Department when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Some. Mostly keeping up with friends—but not too much officially. We got
                    more of that when we went to Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Greece your next post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. We went there in '63 and stayed until '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also learn Greek?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have a lot of languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: It's amazing how quickly you forget. But I'm sure it would come back. Yes, I
                    took Greek once we got there and I went every day for two hours for two years.
                    The best help was having a maid who couldn't speak English so you are forced to
                    speak it. And being there five years is a good length of time to learn. John had
                    had language training for nine months, full time, six or seven hours a day,
                    before we went to Greece. It was grueling, but he was very proficient. It was a
                    very enjoyable post.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you like most?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:Just sort of the Mediterranean atmosphere—it was like Naples in some
                    ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: John took a lot of trips and I was able to go with him. We'd take a jeep
                    from the Embassy. We did Crete that way, we went all through the Peloponnesus,
                    and we went through northern Greece up to Janina. It, of course, was a difficult
                    time politically. We were there when they overthrew the King and they had the
                    coup of the Generals and it was a sad period. After the coup we had a lot of
                    people knocking on our door, after dark sometimes. They wanted help from John.
                    They couldn't phone because their phones were tapped and they couldn't go to the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these people he already knew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:Yes. Some of them were put under house arrest. They were looking for help one
                    way or another—sometimes to get out. And then a lot of people we had known were
                    arrested and put in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the atmosphere seem violent? Were you afraid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Well, I remember the day the coup started. I woke up at about two in the
                    morning, and I heard the tanks going down the road. I got up and looked out and
                    saw it was tanks and went back to bed and went to sleep [laughter]. I guess I
                    thought it was a dream—it didn't click with me, although that was a military
                    route from downtown Athens. So in the morning the phone rang at about seven. It
                    was a friend of Sydney's, who was then in the fifth grade, and she gave us the
                    news that there had been a coup. John left to try to go to the Embassy—I don't
                    think our phone worked, it was then cut off—and that was scary because down by
                    the plaza just before the Embassy, it was all tanks and troops. He'd gotten in
                    as far as the DCM's house and then drove in the rest of the way with him. Once
                    he got in there he wasn't sure of when he was going to come home. As I remember,
                    he was there a couple of nights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he able to call you? Were you worried?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: It was worrisome. I don't remember if we were really out of touch. Things
                    did settle down but it wasn't the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose it was very interesting for John.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:Oh, yes, but sad, too. And particularly so when the Americans were accused of
                    bringing this about or supporting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get that feeling from your friends—did you feel
                        people were looking at you differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, I don't think so. It was the newspapers really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your children were all in school by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Two of them were. Christina was pre-school. Actually she went to a Greek
                    nursery school. This little old Renault would come and pick up all the kids and
                    it was like a circus car—all the little kids stuffed in this car. It was a good
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She liked it? She didn't object to not being
                        understood?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: She spoke Greek. She was just a baby when we went—I think six months old—and
                    we had maids who spoke nothing but Greek so she spoke both Greek and
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the older two? Was it an international school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: They went to the Ursuline school. There were two choices for English
                    speaking schools and that was one. The other was the American school. It was
                    really a wonderful school. They had a very international group. The teachers and
                    the nuns were American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend most of your time with Americans there—with
                        the Embassy crowd? You didn't live all together did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Oh, no. We never had Embassy housing—ever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made a point of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DAY: We would have been glad to have it—but it just never happened. There was a
                    real mix of people. There was a group we used to play bridge with, two to three
                    tables. A mixture of Greek and some Australians, Lebanese. It was very busy
                    socially. Three nights a week. But we got to know a lot of Greeks very well.
                    They are very friendly people and sociable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was the weather always perfect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Almost always. It wouldn't rain all summer from April to October, then there
                    were some rainy spells. But in the long summer there isn't even any dew. You can
                    sleep out—nothing's ever damp. When the sun goes down it's just lovely and cool,
                    never humid. We did a lot of swimming and picnicking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, after Greece, were you back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, for a long tour: eight years we stayed in Washington. We bought a
                    house, got moved in, and then we were offered a small consular post in Italy—and
                    it was one of those things...we would have loved to go ordinarily but I couldn't
                    face moving again right on top of getting back and having been away so long. So
                    we stayed there and eventually moved to Ottawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During those eight years in Washington, did you work
                        again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. I ended up just working at home though for the same person I had worked
                    for before, publishing a technical newsletter. I was doing the business end of
                    that. It worked out well. The kids were in the sixth and eighth grade and first
                    grade and I didn't really want to be away from home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you living right in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, we were in Potomac. We bought a house, finally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the house with the famous fence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During lunch before this interview, I had admired that
                        wonderful garden here at the house in Ossipee (this is to the tape, Susan).
                        It's unbelievable the amount of flowers. Susan, say again what happened in
                        Potomac.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Well, we had a small fence out back. The kitchen window looked out on it. I
                    thought it would be nice to have a border of flowers in front of it that I could
                    see from the kitchen. It was like pulling teeth to get John to dig that up—once
                    he did it though, he never stopped!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he built gardens all around that house in Potomac?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, and we took white pines from this place down there because there was no
                    privacy in that house. We took the trees down in the back of a little VW and
                    planted them in 95 degree heat. They're about 60 to 75 feet high now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your move go easily coming back from Greece? Your
                        children adjusted all right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:Actually, we came here to New Hampshire first because we had home leave
                    coming. I came before John did, in June and then he came in August. He had to go
                    to Washington but then he came back here for more home leave. So the kids went
                    to school here in New Hampshire from September to December and they loved it. No
                    problems. And then we went down to Washington and we were in that section of
                    Potomac, Maryland. And, I don't know, my oldest daughter had a terrible time
                    adjusting. She was just miserable. It was an area where nobody had any
                    roots—nobody knew anybody else—it was that kind of a situation and, of course,
                    it was that time just before the whole drug business was starting. The whole
                    atmosphere was: “let it all hang out.” She had a hard time adjusting. It's
                    strange that the hardest move can be back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was in the eighth grade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. We stayed on for eight years, though, so both the older kids had
                    graduated by the time we left. Christina was still in school when we went to
                    Ottawa. But that was hard, too, the move to Ottawa. Sydney was working but Mark
                    was just out of high school. He went a semester to the State College but he
                    really wasn't ready for it. He wasn't old enough to do well. He ended up coming
                    with us to Ottawa and he went part-time to the University of Ottawa. That worked
                    out well. He was there for three years and then he went back to Washington and
                    eventually put himself through the University of Maryland on his own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Christina went to high school in Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DAY: Yes. She was in eighth grade. She went to Lisgar Collegiate. And that wasn't
                    too difficult a move. The kids there were very nice—it was a good atmosphere at
                    school—in the whole town for that matter. She liked to skate and to ski—she
                    broke a leg and an arm in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you like Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Oh, I liked it—a delightful city—very easy living, an easy adjustment. There
                    was some anti-Americanism I always felt, but individually people were very
                    nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to use the French you learned in Holland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Not much. I could read and write it pretty well but I didn't seem to have
                    the opportunity to speak it—and if I had the opportunity, I felt too
                    uncomfortable with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel a lot in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, not as much as I would have liked to. We did go to Toronto, Montreal,
                    Nova Scotia and Quebec City, but I never got to the west coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, since you were so close to New
                        Hampshire, you would come down here for vacations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, we came to New Hampshire and sometimes to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your daughter still has friends up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. She just went to her best friend's wedding in Toronto. She thought of
                    going back there—actually both my son and daughter liked it so much they did
                    think of going back but it's not that easy to get a work permit—we kind of
                    discouraged it and they didn't go. But my son has very good friends: he met a
                    family with seven brothers—he still goes back to see them and they go to
                    Washington sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Embassy nice—a close community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, I don't think it was and I think the morale there was very low and that
                    was difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was from there that John decided to retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, he always says its the best thing he ever did. We are both enjoying it
                    very much. I don't envy young Foreign Service Officers going out with the
                    political situation the way it is in the world: terrorist groups and that kind
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the morale in the State Department generally
                        was becoming a little lower as the years went by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes, I do. We all started out with great enthusiasm I think—although I must
                    say I never enjoyed the discipline or whatever you want to call it that some
                    people felt they had to impose on you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I wanted to ask you about that. This is one of the
                        things this oral history project is looking at. Did that Foreign Service
                        directive in the early seventies that said that wives would no longer be on
                        their husband's efficiency reports...did you feel before that you had to
                        always do the right thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then afterward that you could kick up your heels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, I don't think things changed at all—on paper maybe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have some difficult people in your posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Oh, yes. I got called on the carpet once in Greece. It was when King
                    Constantine's father died and we were in mourning for three months or so. There
                    was a party given the day after the mourning was lifted and I wore a black dress
                    because I was a little bit pregnant and it was the only dress I could fit into.
                    And the next day the wife of the DCM directed the wife of the Political
                    Counselor to call me in, read me the rules of etiquette and made mention about
                    that dress, and anything else she could think of for me. I mean, that sort of
                    thing. And Fourth of July parties that were so organized that you had to stand
                    in that corner from eleven to eleven-thirty and somebody else in this corner. It
                    was so orchestrated that it was just ridiculous to everybody, I'm sure. And you
                    couldn't have a Christmas party without a rehearsal. We were going to do some
                    bell ringing and we had to rehearse for that just for an Embassy Christmas
                    party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DAY: No, it was in Holland. Yes, I felt there was a lot of pressure all the time.
                    It may have been me partly, other people maybe handled it better, but I did feel
                    uptight about it most of the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DAY: I don't think it made that much difference. You still were expected to do
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you find when you left the Foreign Service it was
                        a huge relief—and you can now say anything you want to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:I think it is lovely! I don't miss it at all. We made a lot of good friends,
                    and we had a lot of good experiences, but I don't think I'd want to do it
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have trouble with the logistics of moving?
                        Did you handle that in your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: I think we both did it together. I don't think I was left...the only time I
                    had to do it was from Washington to Ottawa, because John had to go up earlier
                    and I had to handle one end of the move. But that wasn't as difficult as some
                    moves might be. You could drive up and you had your car to throw all those last
                    minute things into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't really the moving per se that wearied you in
                        the Foreign Service as much as just the general atmosphere—parties every
                        night, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Yes. All the moves went all right. Sometimes the furniture would take
                    forever to arrive and we'd be six to eight weeks in a hotel while we were
                    looking for a house, or waiting for one to be available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not easy with kids. Is there anything else you'd like to
                        say? One thing I was wondering about. You said you had just three months in
                        Washington right at the beginning of your Foreign Service career when you
                        learned Italian. Would it have been helpful to have been given some training
                        about—not about whether you had to stand in a corner at the Fourth of July
                        party—but about what you might have to expect in different countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DAY: Yes. I think so. I'm trying to remember. I think we were given a book on
                    social usage in the Foreign Service to read and study—about calling cards, and
                    making calls on people, and how to address people, and don't ever sit on the
                    sofa—you know, that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good Lord—I didn't know that. I've sat on a lot of
                        sofas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: It's the seat of honor, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In every country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY:I think so. Anyway we were given that sort of thing to make you worry before
                    you got there. But I guess it was probably helpful to know the kind of thing you
                    were going to run into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But maybe area training for the rest of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: It would have been helpful. I remember getting off the boat in Naples and
                    just being overwhelmed, and getting to the hotel, adjusting to the food and all
                    that sort of thing. John had been to Europe before, but I never had. And
                    especially Naples with its narrow streets and the port area was kind of
                    wild.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know what you mean. I see we're at the end of our tape.
                        Many thanks for sharing your stories and thoughts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: I think this oral history is interesting to do but I'm sure that a lot of
                    people have been through more exciting times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way the day-to-day things that we all went through
                        are actually the most exciting, and you went through a coup—how exciting do
                        you want to get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAY: Right. But I was thinking of those Embassy people in Pakistan who were holed
                    up in the top floor of the Embassy for two days or so when the Pakistani army
                    rescued them from the rioting on the floors below—that was a lot to go
                    through.</p>
