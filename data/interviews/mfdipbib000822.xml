                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Lew Schmidt, interviewing Jim Moceri at his home
                        in Auburn, Washington, on May 22, 1990.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Jim, I'm going to ask you to start out by giving a little background on yourself,
                    what your early experiences were, and where you went to school—your education.
                    If you had any preliminary work before you got into the government information
                    program, you can cover that. And from that point on, once you get to the point
                    of getting into the Agency, or its predecessor, then we'll simply follow your
                    career from there, covering different aspects of your work in each location.</p>
                <p>So why don't you start right now?</p>
                <p>Bio Sketch - Education</p>
                <p>MOCERI: I grew up in Seattle and went to school in Seattle—Garfield High—and then
                    on to the University of Washington, where I graduated in 1937 with majors in
                    European history and political science. In '37 I went to graduate school at
                    Columbia University, hoping to study under Carlton J. H. Hayes, the leading
                    authority on the history of nationalism.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>During the course of graduate work at Columbia, I worked for the Federal Writers
                    Project as a writer, and produced a series of pamphlets on subjects as varied as
                    “Soil Conservation” for the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, the lives and
                    works of New Jersey painters of the 19th century, Washington in New Jersey
                    during the Revolutionary War. Transferring later to the New Jersey Historical
                    Records Survey (also part of the WPA program) first as an editor and
                    subsequently as a supervisor, I worked on volumes of local history, including
                    manuscript collections and inventories of county and municipal archives. In
                    1940, I was asked to take charge of the largest and most important research
                    project in American history then being carried out under the umbrella of the New
                    Jersey Historical Records Survey. The project also had the sponsorship of the
                    history department of Columbia University, a factor which had played some part
                    in my selection as the new director. The objective was to produce a massive and
                    indeed exhaustive history of the nearly 34,000 roll-call votes taken in the U.S.
                    Congress from 1789 to 1932. I was responsible for the work of a staff of more
                    than 100 people engaged in this and a series of related projects. It was my
                    first experience in what could accurately be described as large scale
                    substantive and managerial program direction.</p>
                <p>I must digress at this point to take note of my intellectual and political
                    concerns from the mid-thirties to the outbreak of World War II. Although my
                    general field of study was modern European history, my more specific interests
                    centered on nationalism as a political force, the intellectual history of 19th
                    century Europe (and on this subject Jacques Barzun created for my benefit a
                    graduate seminar at Columbia), and the nature and theory of history itself.
                    Politically I had come to the conclusion by the mid-thirties that fascism and
                    communism posed in differing guises and for differing reason a mortal threat to
                    the continuation of the liberal and humanistic achievements of western
                    civilization. In reaching this conclusion I had been much influenced by the
                    writings of the great Italian historian-philosopher Benedetto Croce. The failure
                    of the League of Nations to check the Japanese conquest of Manchuria and
                    Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia convinced me that a general war had become
                    inevitable, at least on a Europe-wide scale.</p>
                <p>Pearl Harbor—The War Years</p>
                <p>Pearl Harbor marked the end of the entire Historical Records Research Program on
                    which I had been employed. I later applied for a commission in the Navy as a
                    junior officer, and served in the Pacific Theater. As a communications officer
                    on the staff of the commander of the amphibious forces of the Pacific fleet, I
                    participated in the Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations.</p>
                <p>At the end of the war, I applied for and received a post-war fellowship from the
                    Rockefeller Foundation for research on Italian political developments in the
                    20th century, particularly the liberal opposition to fascism in Italy.</p>
                <p>1947-49: Assistant Professor At College Of Northern Idaho; Leads To Fulbright
                    Scholarship</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>From 1947 to 1949, I was employed as an assistant professor at a newly
                    established college in northern Idaho at Farragud, the former Navy boot camp.
                    There I handled the course offerings in ancient and modern history and in
                    political science as well. Learning that a Fulbright program for Italy would be
                    inaugurated in 1949, I applied for a grant to do full time research in Italy. My
                    application was accepted, and in November of 1949, accompanied by my wife and
                    daughter, I was on my way to Italy as one of the first group of Fulbrighters in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>En Route To Italy, Moceri Meets (And Mollifies) Congressman John Rooney</p>
                <p>At this point the recollection of an incident that occurred during our trip to
                    Italy may constitute at least a minor footnote to a history of the Fulbright
                    program. Almost the entire group of American Fulbrighters selected for Italy
                    traveled together on board the vessel Saturnia in third class from New York to
                    Genoa. About three days out of New York I was summoned to meet an individual who
                    I was informed was Assistant Secretary of State Peurifoy. After some preliminary
                    conversation he informed me that he was accompanying Congressman John Rooney.
                    The Congressman had had that day an unfortunate run-in with two young
                    Fulbrighters and was so enraged that he was threatening to cancel the entire
                    Fulbright program on his return to Washington. Having made inquiries and heard
                    quite complimentary things about me and my wife, Peurifoy wanted us to join Rep.
                    Rooney at his dinner table and spend the evening with him. Quite simply, our
                    task was to mollify Mr. Rooney. Little could I have imagined that that would be
                    my first diplomatic assignment. Apparently, my wife and I succeeded because
                    nothing more was heard of the unpleasant incident. Only many years later did I
                    learn that my first and only encounter with Congressman Rooney was with the man
                    who later became the terror of USIA witnesses at budget hearings.</p>
                <p>1949: Close Contact With Historian Benedetto Croce At The Italian Institute For
                    Historical Studies In Naples</p>
                <p>In Naples as a Fulbright scholar I was attached to the Italian Institute for
                    Historical Studies, located in the home of Benedetto Croce, the distinguished
                    Italian philosopher-historian in whose works I'd been greatly interested ever
                    since my undergraduate days. I spent two years there. During that time, I had my
                    first contacts with USIS/Naples, because Fulbrighters were expected to maintain
                    contact with the Fulbright Commission in Rome through the local USIS office. In
                    the course of my stay at the Italian Institute of Historical Studies, I was
                    fortunate enough to have excellent personal rapport with Benedetto, the entire
                    staff of the Institute, and all the young Italian historians working there in
                    various fields of historical studies. This gave me a wide range of contacts in
                    Italian life, because these students, mostly people in their early twenties,
                    came from all part of Italy.</p>
                <p>Activities At The Institute And Lecture At USIS Library Ultimately Leads To
                    Entrance Into USIA Predecessor Agency</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get this in perspective, what was the date that
                        you took up your Fulbright studies in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: As I said, I arrived in Italy in November of 1949. My Fulbright grant was
                    renewed for a second year at Croce's request, so I remained in Naples at the
                    Institute until June of 1950. During that period, people at USIS, particularly
                    the branch PAO, Chet Opal, became aware of the degree of my acceptance in
                    Italian intellectual circles.</p>
                <p>This point was certainly made when I was invited to give a lecture at the USIS
                    library. I chose to lecture on Charles Beard and his concept of American
                    civilization. My impression was that people at USIS were rather surprised by the
                    attendance at the lecture; the director of the Institute, Frederico Chabod, who
                    was one of the most noted of contemporary European historians and at the time
                    president of the International Conference of Historians, came with the rest of
                    his staff and many of the students. These were people who had never shown up at
                    any USIS function before.</p>
                <p>Word apparently got to USIS Rome and the American Embassy about my activities in
                    Neapolitan intellectual circles. I was sounded out on the prospects of joining
                    the United States information program and subsequently invited to apply. I
                    hadn't thought of the possibility at all, because my intention had been to go on
                    with historical research, my specialty having been European intellectual history
                    in the 19th century.</p>
                <p>I discussed the possibility with my Italian friends. They urged me to give it
                    serious consideration because they felt that, if I joined the American Foreign
                    Service in Italy, they would have a contact who at least knew the ABCs of
                    Italian political life. As they said, “We don't have to explain the ABCs to you.
                    You know them.” These were people, young people, best defined as members of the
                    Italian democratic center, outside of the confessional party, the Christian
                    Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>The feeling in these circles was that Americans in Italy talked to democrats but
                    slept with the Fascists. I found their arguments persuasive, and decided, if I
                    could be of help in furthering what I viewed as the common cause of the United
                    States and the kind of Italy that I cared about, it would be worth making some
                    contribution. So I went through the formalities of applying, on the assumption
                    that, after all, I'd be sent back to Italy because USIS Rome wanted me.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Two elements in the experiences of my Neapolitan years are worth recalling
                    because they later counted heavily among the factors that persuaded me to join
                    the USIS sphere of activities in the Foreign Service. My closest Neapolitan
                    friends, whom I had met at the Institute, were under constant, almost daily
                    attack by the local Communist party leaders and intellectuals in the press, in
                    communist publications, and in every forum of political cultural activity. The
                    attacks on my friends, who were fondly referred to by their own democratic
                    colleagues in northern Italy as “i quattro radicali del Mezzogiorno” (best
                    translated as “the little band of Southern radicals”), were vituperative and all
                    too frequently violent in tone: most common was the threat to hang them from the
                    lampposts of Naples the day when the revolution would come. The post-war
                    struggle between democratic and communist forces thus became internalized for me
                    as a civil war in progress within the framework of Western civilization. If I
                    really honored my friendship with these young Italians, I had a moral obligation
                    to join forces with them in the common struggle to preserve and enlarge the
                    arena of liberty in the modern world, a struggle which even then appeared to
                    become long-enduring.</p>
                <p>The second element was one that I came to call the “Great Fear of 1950.” In the
                    late spring and summer of 1950 a wide-spread conviction took root among my
                    friends and in many other Italian circles that Soviet forces would indeed invade
                    western Europe in August of that year. My friends actively engaged in planning
                    escape routes and organization of eventual resistance activities. The danger
                    never materialized, but the fear was not entirely groundless. The episode
                    further strengthened my growing conviction that the struggle to reaffirm and
                    expand a liberal order in the post-war world was not a matter of abstract
                    verbalisms but the very flesh and blood of politics, national and
                    international.</p>
                <p>1951: Entrance Into USIA Predecessor Organization: Initial Attempt To Assign
                    Moceri To Argentina Aborted Made Branch PAO In Bari</p>
                <p>I left Italy at the end of June of 1950 and returned home to visit with my own
                    family in the Seattle area. At one point, I got a call from Washington saying
                    they had received my application, had processed it and were prepared to offer me
                    an appointment if I would be interested in going to Buenos Aires. I thought this
                    was strange indeed because I'd been asked by the American staff in Italy to join
                    that staff in Italy, where I thought I could make a more direct and immediate
                    contribution, based on a substantial knowledge of Europe and its history,
                    particularly of Italian affairs.</p>
                <p>I expressed my dismay. Oh, incidentally, I was told that this would be at the
                    FSR-4 level. I had no idea what the FSR-4 meant and did not ask, primarily
                    because I thought it was a little absurd to offer me Buenos Aires when I knew no
                    Spanish. I knew nothing about South America. I couldn't see what kind of
                    contribution I could make in the short term. I assumed that it would take me at
                    least a year to learn anything, to be able to do any kind of meaningful work in
                    Argentina.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Well, I refused. Two weeks later I got a call from someone apparently in the
                    European division of the State Department. I was informed that the division was
                    delighted to be able to offer me a position in Italy. After all, they had worked
                    out this arrangement and were glad to offer me a position as director of the
                    USIS operation in Bari, Italy. I was to open it up and that was quite important
                    to them. Would I accept that position at a FSR-5/3 level? Again, I never asked
                    what it meant in monetary terms.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: [Laughter] Well, I learned later that it always would be a feather in the
                    cap of any personnel officer to get someone at a lower rate than had originally
                    been planned. But I thought, well, I knew Bari. I knew something of Bari. It
                    was, among many other things, also the seat of an important publishing house. I
                    felt I could make a contribution there. So I indicated my immediate acceptance.
                    They asked me to report to Washington in early November of 1951.</p>
                <p>So I arrived in Washington knowing absolutely nothing about Washington
                    bureaucracy. I reported in to the personnel office. There I was told to report
                    to the European branch and given a name and an office number. Arrangements would
                    be made there for my briefings. I found the office and reported to the
                    individual whose name had been given me. I asked what I was supposed to do.
                    “Well, sit down and you can spend the next two weeks reading the files.” So I
                    lived with those file cabinets for two weeks, systematically reading their
                    contents. Only then, in those files, did I learn that, in fact, not only USIS
                    Rome had been insistent on the State Department making an effort to get me,
                    recruit me, but also the European division in Washington had been equally
                    insistent and had recommended that I be offered an FSR-4 position.</p>
                <p>The only memorable moment in that Washington experience was my attendance in a
                    large auditorium at a full-scale briefing that Secretary Acheson gave on his
                    recent NATO meeting in Lisbon. I came away enormously impressed by the man.</p>
                <p>Such, then, was the extent of my introduction, orientation and briefing on
                    Washington, the foreign service, USIS organization and functions in Washington
                    and the field, and on my own duties and responsibilities. I had no idea who was
                    in charge of information and cultural programs for the European area. I had no
                    live contacts with anyone except the personnel and travel offices. Once my
                    orders were cut, off I went, after picking up my family, to Rome and arrived
                    there in January of '52.</p>
                <p>On arrival, I reported to the USIS office on Via Buoncompagni in the embassy
                    complex. I had been met at the plane by someone from USIS. I was told to report
                    to Heath Bowman, the USIS Italy deputy director. My introduction, then, to
                    official Foreign Service procedures was a call on the ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Assignment To Bari Changed By Ambassador Dunn To Florence</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Ambassador James Dunn. In the course of the meeting, Ambassador Dunn
                    informed Lloyd Free, the director, and Heath Bowman that he wanted me sent to
                    Florence. There was no further talk of opening the post in Bari. They'd have to
                    look for someone else.</p>
                <p>The reason for sending me to Florence was that Ambassador Dunn was exceedingly
                    unhappy with Colonel Vissering, who was the commanding officer of the military
                    supply base in Livorno, which was the anchor for the supply line—our military
                    supply line—to our troops in Austria and Bavaria. Colonel Vissering was a man
                    who had achieved a certain notoriety. I'd remembered that there were articles in
                    the Reporter magazine, Max Ascoli's Reporter magazine, on Colonel Vissering, who
                    ran the operation pretty much as he saw fit and paid little or no attention to
                    the American Embassy or Ambassador Dunn—to Ambassador Dunn's great
                    displeasure.</p>
                <p>The instruction I received directly from Ambassador Dunn was, “I want you to go
                    to Florence. That will be your base. And I want you to keep an eye on Colonel
                    Vissering and report on his activities and keep him in line with embassy
                    policy.” (I vouch for the accuracy of the quotation, for a neophyte could hardly
                    forget the language of an order so direct and peremptory from so exalted an
                    authority.)</p>
                <p>Well, I may have been naive about government procedures, but I wasn't naive about
                    political realities. And I was astonished that a man who was regarded as one of
                    the stars of the American diplomatic service at the time, a man of very
                    considerable reputation after all, would think that by simply sending someone up
                    as an observer, that this person could keep a strong-minded man like Colonel
                    Vissering in line with Mr. Dunn's own policies, whatever those policies
                    were.</p>
                <p>I knew enough to know that you could not really control anyone unless you had
                    some authority to do so. I had no written document. There was nothing that would
                    empower me to even make inquiries and tell Colonel Vissering that I would
                    appreciate being informed of his actions. I have always had good reason to
                    believe that the Colonel was never informed, officially or otherwise, of the
                    mission with which I had been charged.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I left Rome after five days, a period during which I became
                    acquainted with the staff in Rome. I went to Florence, where I reported to the
                    public affairs officer, Marjorie Ferguson. I informed her of my new assignment,
                    been said and that nothing had been said about my role in USIS activities. I was
                    only to keep a watch on Colonel Vissering. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In the meantime, apparently, Rome decided that this would be a great time for
                    Marjorie Ferguson to get some much-needed home leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could replace her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: [Laughter] So I was there as her substitute and put in charge of the
                    program. I knew nothing about the program at this point, really. So I spent time
                    familiarizing myself with the staff and the USIS activities in the area of
                    Tuscany. And at the same time I made a call on Colonel Vissering in Livorno. And
                    then I began to talk to people in the Livorno area.</p>
                <p>Obviously, I thought it was simply absurd that I maintain any kind of control
                    over Colonel Vissering. [Laughter] He was not the kind of man who was about to
                    listen to anyone out of the line of command. And maybe he didn't listen to
                    people in the line of command, either. But I did keep myself informed as to his
                    policies with regard to labor practices and his relationship with various
                    elements of the society of Livorno—its political society, that is.</p>
                <p>In the course of making inquiries, I became acquainted with quite a few people in
                    the Livorno area, including a Dr. Merli, editor of an interesting little
                    magazine for intellectuals seriously interested in politics.</p>
                <p>I think I should say that, at this point, Livorno had been administered since the
                    end of the war by the Communist Party. The mayor of Livorno was a communist—a
                    young communist intellectual, considered to be one of the coming lights of the
                    Party, and, possibly, an eventual successor to Palmiro Togliatti. His name was
                    Furio Diaz.</p>
                <p>Furio Diaz was then a young man, about my age. I was then 34. His academic work
                    had been in the field of Italian history and of historical methodology, another
                    one of my principal intellectual interests. We later became acquainted and there
                    were some interesting developments, to which I'll get in a moment.</p>
                <p>He had heard about me from Dr. Merli, the editor of the magazine to which I have
                    just referred. Incidentally, Merli was also an increasingly important figure
                    among the Christian Democrats of the Livorno area. Many people might have been
                    surprised by the relationship between the two men. Certainly, Americans would
                    have been surprised that there was this kind of contact and relationship and
                    even friendship among people who were exponents of opposing ideologies. But
                    anyone who'd been in Italy knew that statistically the chances were that every
                    third person one might meet could be a member of the Communist Party. And
                    families were divided, and yet united, as Italian families often are.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I went about my work of learning something of the activities of USIS. I, of
                    course, saw the material sent out by Rome: press releases, material for the
                    press. I became acquainted with a number of Italian newspaper people in
                    Florence, and plunged into the time-consuming routine of developing contacts
                    with editors, publishers, newspapers, magazines, university people, particularly
                    in the areas of politics and history, to identify those who had some influence
                    in local political life, and reached out throughout the Tuscany area which at
                    that time was, of course, communist-controlled. Almost every commune of Tuscany
                    was under the control of a communist administration. I approached people like
                    the people at Il Ponte, an independent left-wing monthly magazine, providing
                    them with materials and (more importantly) laying the foundations for the kind
                    of relationship that would permit serious discussion of political issues of
                    common interest.</p>
                <p>At that time, we had mobile units showing films around the countryside and in
                    Florence itself. So gradually I became familiar with the whole array of USIS
                    materials and techniques of distribution. That, simply, was the mechanical part.
                    The real part was keeping informed as to what the political sentiments were, who
                    the players were, who had any kind of influence, and in what ways.</p>
                <p>And this in an environment where the democratic parties squabbled among
                    themselves as much as they squabbled with the communists. Being the minority,
                    they had little influence on actual political decisions made in the—both in the
                    city of Florence and in the region itself.</p>
                <p>Two Incidents Involving Moceri Contacts With Important Italian Political Figures
                    And Related U.S. Embassy Reactions</p>
                <p>Of memorable experiences, let me point out a couple examples. First, let me get
                    back to Furio Diaz, the mayor of Livorno. Through Dr. Merli, with whom over time
                    I had established an excellent rapport, Furio Diaz learned a good deal about me.
                    In 1955, late '54, early '55, he sent out various feelers and indicated that
                    he'd be interested in meeting with me. Could I arrange for him to receive
                    materials on the Soviet judicial system and practice? I viewed this as the first
                    overture to an eventual break with the Communist Party, and realized immediately
                    what the consequences could be. By 1955 Furio Diaz had established himself, in
                    the opinion of many well-informed people, as the unnamed successor to Togliatti,
                    whenever Togliatti would step down. His defection from the party in 1955, would
                    have severely shaken the party, particularly the whole category of the
                    intellectuals who were members of the party. And, of course, in the area of
                    Tuscany there were a number of prominent intellectuals who were ardent party
                    members.</p>
                <p>I dutifully reported this to USIS Rome and received an interesting response: that
                    I was to stay away from Furio Diaz and the matter would be taken care of through
                    other channels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old-line, political aspect of the ambassadorial
                        hierarchy in those days, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, it's hard to know what may have happened. I assume that at the time
                    Rome decided the matter could be handled very quietly by someone else. It took
                    no great power of divination to sense that the “someone else” proved to be a
                    sometime American journalist living in Florence at the time, whom I knew
                    reasonably well. The point is that Furio Diaz did not leave the party, as I
                    fully anticipated he intended to do in 1955. He left only after the Hungarian
                    revolution and the Soviet suppression of that revolution. Although his defection
                    was an important loss for the Communist Party, it did not have the enormous
                    political impact that it would have had in 1955, a year earlier. In the wake of
                    the Hungarian Revolution, a considerable number of intellectuals left the party,
                    and Diaz was only one among the more prominent. There were others, like Antonio
                    Giolitti, the grandson of the famous premier of the once-democratic, pre-Fascist
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point, do you have any idea how the journalist
                        went about establishing this contact? Was he able to provide the material
                        regarding the legal system of the Soviet Union, as had been asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I knew that the journalist had received this charge. I decided, because I
                    felt that there should be a clear distinction between my activities and CIA
                    activities—I was very sensitive on this subject—I decided not to inform myself.
                    So I do not know what he did, or whether, in fact, he ever established contact.
                    I never saw Furio Diaz again. I never asked my intermediary, Dr. Merli in
                    Livorno. And even though I saw Merli frequently after that, I felt it was just
                    better to let the matter die. Because, in their minds, they must have been
                    greatly puzzled by the strange way in which Americans did things. From their
                    perspective, given what they knew of my intellectual interests, I was surely an
                    “interloceteur valable” for Furio Diaz.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of my association with Dr. Merli in Livorno was that he was very
                    close to the then-president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Giovanni
                    Gronchi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking of the journalist or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I'm speaking of Dr. Merli, the magazine editor. Giovanni Gronchi was, as
                    I said, then president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and later became
                    president of Italy. My friend Merli had obviously briefed him very carefully on
                    me. Whenever Gronchi came to Florence, he made arrangements for me to meet him
                    and spend an hour riding with him in his car around Florence. He would talk to
                    me about his view of America and the Americans in Rome, the European situation
                    and whatever else he felt Americans should hear from him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Christian Democrat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, a leader of an important faction of the left-wing faction of the
                    Christian Democratic Party. For reasons which I never quite understood, he had
                    very poor relations with Mrs. Luce, who had become our ambassador to Italy. When
                    he was elected president of Italy, the relations worsened. I think it was common
                    knowledge that the kindest word, epithet, Mrs. Luce had for Gronchi was “that
                    stallion.” She really had contempt for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you assume that he conducted his conversations with you
                        in his car because he felt that there was a possibility he would be listened
                        to elsewhere or that he'd be too visible and he just wanted you to have it
                        in private?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Right. He learned, felt—because of the things his press secretary, who
                    was my friend, had told him about me—that he could count on me to report
                    accurately anything he said. So he would convey his view of Mrs. Luce and
                    American policy in Italy and so on to me. And I would faithfully report it in
                    written memoranda to Rome, copies of which were apparently sent to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>In 1955, '56—I'm getting confused now, that was '56—Gronchi was invited to the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt just a moment? If you were reporting
                        Gronchi's attitude and feelings towards Mrs. Luce, they couldn't have been
                        very complimentary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Anything but. They were not complimentary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were reporting this to the embassy, or to USIS,
                        with copies to Washington. To USIA in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I sent no copies to Washington. I reported to USIS Rome. I thought it was
                    not up to me to report to Washington. That was a function of the Rome office. I
                    assumed that the embassy political section did see the memoranda that I sent to
                    our people in Rome—to Ned Nordness, the country PAO—and that the CIA people also
                    saw them. Whether the political section had any interest in transmitting my
                    reports to Washington, I don't know. I learned later that the CIA headquarters
                    in Washington did know of my reports.</p>

                        political office in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Could well have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Question is, did it ever get to the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: That I don't know. I have no idea. All I know is, that when Gronchi did
                    come to the United States, Mrs. Luce had recommended that he be given, simply,
                    the courtesy of a brief, get-acquainted meeting with President Eisenhower. And
                    that he then be dismissed by the White House and left to the various other
                    agencies of government, to satisfy his ego.</p>
                <p>The fact of the matter was that Gronchi spent six hours with Eisenhower. I was
                    later told that this was the direct result of the CIA input, based on the
                    various memoranda that I had sent about our conversations, my conversations with
                    Gronchi.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect to this story which has some interest, I think, for the
                    whole question of the USIA role. Gronchi, through his press officer, my friend,
                    asked that I be assigned to him, to accompany him to the United States. My
                    friend felt this was great because I could explain all kinds of things about the
                    United States to Gronchi, who had never been to this country before. He thought
                    I could serve, in fact, as a consultant to him on American life, and so on.</p>
                <p>The request was made verbally to the political section of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By whom? By Gronchi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Gronchi, through his press officer. The response was, “We would like to
                    have this in writing over the President's signature,” something President
                    Gronchi, and I would assume any other President, would never do. They would not
                    put that kind of a request in writing. That was the end of that. [Laughter] I,
                    of course, was rather upset about it.</p>
                <p>I began to understand something about bureaucratic infighting within the American
                    Government—an understanding that became the basis for my later firm belief that
                    the various entities of the U.S. Government spent more time fighting each other
                    than working on their common problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in those days, it was quite common for anybody on
                        the political—the State Department regular political side—to look down upon
                        anyone in USIA. And they refused to admit that anyone in that organization
                        could have a political concept worth considering. So I assume that they felt
                        this would be a slap in the face to them, and, consequently, they were never
                        going to permit it.</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MOCERI: I think you're quite correct. That was the conclusion to which I came. It
                    led to my conviction that the only way those of us in USIA—because by that time
                    we were a separate organization—could establish our own credibility and achieve
                    any kind of status, was to be as good as if not better political officers than
                    any other people in the State Department.</p>
                <p>On Another Occasion Moceri Opportunity To Make Contact With Key Communist Party
                    Central Committee Member Squelched By Ambassador Luce</p>
                <p>And, therefore, we really had to understand the politics of the country to which
                    we were accredited and work ourselves into that fabric so that we could move in
                    it easily and learn. I had met a Montecatini employee responsible for
                    management's relations with that giant corporation's labor force in the mines of
                    the Grosseto province of Tuscany. He had good connections with the top
                    management of the Montecatini industrial complex in Milano, a lot of experience
                    in the labor movement and knew a number of the top cadre of the Italian
                    Communist Party, including, especially, a certain Onofrio, who was the member of
                    the Italian Communist Party Central Committee in charge of the training of
                    communist cadres.</p>
                <p>I had, from him, an open invitation to meet with Onofrio or any other member of
                    the Central Committee any time I wanted. Such meetings could have been easily
                    and quietly arranged. Having been slightly burned in the matter of contacts with
                    the mayor of Livorno, I did let Mrs. Luce know of this new possibility through
                    Ned Nordness. Mrs. Luce informed me, personally, on the occasion of a visit to
                    Florence, that despite all the confidence she had in my judgment and discretion,
                    she could not agree to my meeting with members of the Italian Communist Party
                    hierarchy. If she allowed me to do this, she could not turn down the numerous
                    requests she would inevitably get from other people in the embassy and elsewhere
                    for arranging similar contacts.</p>
                <p>I thought, to myself, we were really cutting off our legs, you know. I felt then
                    that, especially, we Americans ought to be able to talk to anyone in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that American officers ought to be able to
                        talk to anyone in the country. And I said, “Yes, and to each other.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Of course, to each other. Importantly, we ought not to deny ourselves
                    access to any segment of political thought or action in the country, regardless
                    of the attitude of the governing group. For it is in the nature of history that
                    change occurs. And those who may have been in opposition or in dissent might one
                    day be in power. And it also becomes a valuable means of checking on the claims
                    and pretensions and, indeed, the effective power of the governing group. I might
                    have more to say about this when I get to the question of my service in the
                    Sudan.</p>

                <p>Success Of Moceri's Fulbright Exchange Nominees</p>
                <p>During all these years there were of course all the other, more conventional USIS
                    activities in which I was heavily involved. A few examples, by way of
                    illustration. In a city with a great tradition of private libraries and
                    semi-private libraries belonging to generally restricted scholarly societies
                    (sometimes centuries-old), I wanted the open-shelved USIS library to be as rich
                    in its holdings as possible. So much of what had been published in America
                    during the Fascist era and the war years was virtually unknown in Italy,
                    exception being made for a handful of specialists. Moreover, given Florentine
                    pride in the city's great literary traditions, I made every effort to ensure
                    that our library had the most substantial holdings in American literature and
                    literary magazines in all of Italy. I personally interviewed—and recommended as
                    candidates to the Fulbright Commission in Rome—all Italian applicants for
                    Fulbright grants residing in my territorial area of responsibility. For me it
                    became a source of considerable satisfaction and even pride that virtually all
                    my recommendations were accepted by the Fulbright Commission. In later decades
                    most of these grantees achieved standings of some note in the political or
                    intellectual life of Italian society. The same could be said, in even more
                    unqualified terms, for my recommendations of candidates for our State
                    Department-financed leader program.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of this last point let me cite the case of Ettore Bernabei,
                    who was when I first met him the editor of the Florentine daily Il Mattino
                    d'Italia, the local mouthpiece of the ruling Christian Democratic Party. After
                    we had developed a reasonably good working relationship, I made it possible for
                    him to go to the United States on one of our leader grants. By the mid-sixties
                    he had been elevated to the position of director-general of Italy's RAI/TV, the
                    State's radio/television broadcasting monopoly.</p>
                <p>Transfer Of Branch PAO, Florence, Ultimately Makes Moceri BPAO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little past the time when I should have asked
                        the question but, did you, in effect, subsequently, become the Branch PAO?
                        Or did the lady [Marjorie Ferguson] return and assume her position? And when
                        you were undertaking these activities and these offers, were you then head
                        of the program in Florence or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, I was the head. When Marjorie Ferguson returned from her home leave,
                    a decision had been made by Lloyd Free and Heath Bowman to move her up to
                    Milano, which really was a much more important center because Milano was the
                    economic capital of Italy. I'd been de facto head of the USIS office in
                    Florence. And on Marjorie's return from home leave, I became the de jure
                    head.</p>
                <p>October 1953: Budget Cuts Cause Closing Of USIS Bologna, And Transfer Of BPAO
                    There To Be Head Of USIS Florence, Situation Uncomfortable</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Then, a year later, because of budget cuts in Washington, they decided to
                    consolidate offices. And there was a decision to abolish the Bologna office as a
                    separate branch post, retaining however the office, staff and library as part of
                    the USIS Florence operation. Frederick Jochum, who was the PAO in Bologna, was
                    transferred to Florence as the new director. Being junior to Fritz in grade, I
                    was downgraded to the rank of deputy branch PAO; something which greatly puzzled
                    all my Florentine associates and contacts. Word kept coming back to me, “How do
                    Americans run their administrative procedures?”</p>
                <p>They found this move puzzling because they viewed the change in my status as a
                    question of personal dignity; that it would have been more correct to have
                    removed me from Florence rather than to subject me to the humiliation of a
                    subordinate position in the same office. But there were games that were played.
                    As Heath Bowman said, “They just wanted to see how the chemistry would work.”
                    And I was determined to make it work. [Laughter] After all, there wasn't much
                    else I could do, and I did want the momentum of the program activities I had
                    been developing to continue. It was more uncomfortable for Fritz Jochum, because
                    he really had to overcome attitudes of puzzlement and even resentment among his
                    Florentine contacts. I think it fair to say that he never really succeeded.</p>
                <p>In the process, though, I also, in that period in Florence, established very good
                    relations with a group of young university people in Bologna who had gotten a
                    magazine and small publishing house under way. Working with Gertrude Hooker, an
                    assistant cultural affairs officer in Rome, we got them interested in the USIS
                    translation program. And they became—the group of Il Molino—became one of the
                    principal publishing outlets for our translation program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What translation program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The book translation program. Today Il Molino ranks as one of the leading
                    publishing houses in Italy. It's almost as important as Mondadori, the giant
                    among Italian book publishers. And for scholarly work, probably even more
                    important. That, to me, was a real achievement.</p>
                <p>So much of this, so much of my work with the intellectuals, magazines, newspapers
                    and universities could be traced back to the initial contacts that I'd made at
                    the Italian Institute for Historical Studies in Naples. That earlier association
                    made it possible for me to move into almost any Italian city and rapidly develop
                    a useful network of contacts and personal relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Unlike France, in Italy influence and prestige and power are all related to given
                    circles. And the circles are always overlapping. Therefore, if you have entree
                    in one circle, that entree enables you to move into any number of other circles.
                    Each circle always radiates outward for almost always each member of the circle
                    has ties with other circles. In France each circle is virtually self-contained,
                    and movement from one circle to another becomes quite difficult to manage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In France, everything goes to Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: It's one thing and one group. As I have said, if you work with one group
                    it's very difficult to move into another group. In Italy, it's quite
                    different.</p>
                <p>1954-55: Moceri Again Becomes Branch PAO, Florence, And Soon Adds Bologna,
                    Venice, and Trieste To His Region</p>
                <p>In 1955, the Allied military government in Trieste was dissolved and
                    administration was turned over to Italy. Parenthetically, I should note here
                    that Fritz Jochum remained less than a year before transferring to Washington in
                    a more important position in the motion picture division. I thus inherited not
                    only the Emilia-Romagna region around Bologna but also Venice, where our offices
                    had been closed down, and its hinterland, the Veneto. All this in 1954. And then
                    in 1955, Trieste as well. The territory for which I was responsible accounted
                    for more than a quarter of Italy's territory and contained, after all, some of
                    the most important universities, magazines, publishers, and newspapers as well
                    as the electoral backbone of the Italian communist party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: No, I had been restored to the position of branch PAO upon Fritz Jochum's
                    departure for Washington.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. And Fritz had been partly responsible, I think, for the upgrading of
                    my status. He'd come in suspecting that I would probably be disloyal to him. He
                    made several trips to Rome to find out what I might have been reporting through
                    other channels. I suppose you might say “back channels,” [Laughter] although I
                    didn't even know that term at the time. As he acknowledged later, he satisfied
                    himself that I'd been completely loyal and that I kept our differences entirely
                    within our personal relationship. In Washington, I know he was responsible for
                    putting in a very strong word for me. It was only at the end of 1954 that I was
                    given my first promotion.</p>

                    party or coalition of parties which received 50% plus 1 vote—in other words, a
                    numerical majority of at least one vote—would receive 66% of the seats in the
                    Chamber of Deputies.</p>
                <p>Americans seem not to have understood that this was the same law by which
                    Mussolini had seized control of the Italian Parliament. It had been pressed, of
                    course, by the Christian Democratic Party. They wanted to assure themselves of
                    the majority. We saw this as a way of guaranteeing the passage of anything we
                    wanted our friends in the Italian Government to do.</p>
                <p>My own soundings, not only in Tuscany, but through my various friends in other
                    cities of Italy, led me to the conclusion that unless Mario Scelba, who was
                    Minister of Interior of the Christian Democratic Government, could manipulate
                    more than 10% of the vote, the center coalition formed by the DC's and Liberals,
                    Republicans and Social Democrats would not win the necessary majority.</p>
                <p>There was a meeting of the branch public affairs officers in Rome in the early
                    spring of '53. Lloyd Free presided. Naturally, the concern, the concern of all
                    the people in the American Embassy in Rome, was the issue of the upcoming
                    elections. Would the center get its majority? And there was great confidence
                    that it would.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The reporting to Washington had been that they would win a majority, though it
                    must be said that as the date of the elections approached the prediction of the
                    margin of victory kept changing so that the margin kept shrinking. At the
                    meeting, every branch PAO reported, for his area, that yes, things were going
                    well and the center coalition would, indeed, win and win solidly.</p>
                <p>This was one of my first meetings. And I spoke up. I was asked, by Lloyd Free,
                    what the feeling was in Tuscany. I reported on that. I then broadened by
                    statements to say, flatly, that I did not think that the center coalition would
                    get its majority. Lloyd Free was almost visibly shaken. I was called in the next
                    day and raked over the coals for my “presumption” in the face of the
                    conventional wisdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised. Because I had known Lloyd Free before and I
                        would have thought that he would have given some credence to that report.
                        I'm surprised that he reacted the way you say he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, I don't know what pressures there may have been on Lloyd Free.
                    After all, even a country PAO is not a free agent. And I have to assume that he
                    was dealing with a situation, some aspects of which I did not know.</p>
                <p>Let me say that, once the election returns came in, I got a telephone call from
                    Lloyd Free. He asked me to come down to Rome to spend two days. I went to Rome.
                    He called me into his office on my arrival. And he told me that he wanted,
                    personally, to apologize for having raked me over the coals. He wanted me to
                    understand that he recognized that I had been right in my analysis and he
                    accepted that. And I was, as you can imagine, immensely pleased, because I think
                    this was the first word of praise that I'd received from anyone in USIA.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A similar situation arose in 1953 regarding Japan. Sax
                        Bradford was my PAO in Japan. When he went to Washington on home leave in
                        1953, he was convinced that Yoshida, who was then Prime Minister, was going
                        to be defeated decisively in an upcoming national election, because of a
                        misstep he had made in the Diet. A majority, but not everybody in Japan
                        thought so. Sax in his debriefing at the State Department assured everyone
                        at State without reservation that Yoshida would lose. Two weeks later,
                        Yoshida was returned by an overwhelming majority. You can imagine Bradford's
                        embarrassment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. The American Embassy spent a good deal of time trying to explain
                    away its miscalculation. There was always talk about the—something like 3,000
                    votes short of majority, without any realization of what the broader
                    implications of such a victory might have been. This was stealing the elections,
                    in the crudest sense possible, and in the pattern of a, by then, well-hated
                    regime—a regime, which had brought Italy only disaster.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was talking earlier about people I sent to the States. I sent another
                    journalist, a young man named Lepri, to the United States on a Leader grant. Ten
                    years later he was made the head of ANSA, the Italian news agency.</p>
                <p>Well, this happened, you know, with many of the people I recommended for either
                    Fulbright grants or Leader grants; people who in the years after I left Italy
                    carved out a position of prominence for themselves in Italian affairs, even on
                    the national level. Obviously, it meant that I felt very deeply about the
                    importance of this kind of grantee-type program and a very strong sense of
                    responsibility for selecting people who had the kind of substance that could
                    lead to important positions in Italian life.</p>
                <p>1955: Moceri Becomes Acting PAO for Italy For About Three Months</p>
                <p>In 1955, I got a call from Ned Nordness in Rome, by then our Public Affairs
                    Officer in Rome, to come down to Rome and act in his place. He had suffered an
                    injury. So I went down to Rome and became acting country public affairs officer
                    for about three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what date was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: This was the summer of '55. Ned was hospitalized and then decided to take
                    some leave until he had fully recovered. So for three months I was in charge of
                    the Italian program—a difficult time, faced as I was with the problem of
                    submitting the annual report and a country budget, to mention only two major
                    items. I'd never dealt with a country budget before. Moreover, there was no
                    deputy country PAO and I also had to assume the responsibilities of chief
                    information officer—yet another vacancy at the top of the country program.</p>
                <p>I think the thing that astonished me most in Rome was lack of coordination among
                    the various officers of USIS Rome. They had country responsibilities and also
                    local responsibilities. And messages would go out with little or no
                    coordination. So I set up, for myself, a procedure for reviewing absolutely all
                    outgoing correspondence before it left our offices. And I'd send notes to
                    people, saying in effect, “Look, why didn't you check with your colleague across
                    the hall?”</p>
                <p>I was appalled. I couldn't understand this sort of thing. The press section never
                    talked to the people in the cultural section, and vice versa. Or one officer to
                    another officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any—as director—staff meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Oh yes, I did. Of course, I did. The staff went through all those
                    formalities, but when it came time to do their own work they never bothered to
                    inform anybody else. So that occupied a lot of time. I was the lowest-ranking
                    branch PAO in Italy, and outranked by all department heads in Rome headquarters.
                    This meant that I could establish my authority only through exhaustive knowledge
                    of all our operations. That was the only way I could to it with any
                    credibility.</p>
                <p>Massive 1955 Report On Evidence Of Effectiveness Of USIS Libraries In Italy
                    Eventually Falls Into Oblivion</p>
                <p>One of the most important items of business during that summer of 1955 was the
                    requirement to submit to Washington, together with the USIS Budget, the annual
                    report on USIS Italy activities. I had been appalled by the lack of interest,
                    indeed the indifference, shown by so many of our officers in our library
                    operations in Italy. I was well aware of all the pressure from Washington for
                    the submission of evidence of effectiveness. (I had my own views—skeptical, to
                    say the least—on what often was palmed off as evidence of effectiveness.)</p>
                <p>I realized I could use the authority of my new situation to produce a solid body
                    of evidence that could be subjected to independent verification. I drafted a
                    message to all our branches, requesting them to submit in their reports a
                    specific accounting of the uses made of our libraries. Specifically, I wanted
                    this in terms of university theses, papers, articles, materials prepared for
                    public speeches, etc., by Italians using materials from our libraries.</p>
                <p>I wanted titles, publication date, if any, when the material was prepared, who
                    prepared it, under whose supervision, and for what purpose. My hope was that we
                    could put together a checklist that could be analyzed and subjected to
                    independent verification. I was insistent on that last requirement because I
                    wanted branch PAO's to realize there could be no fudging or doctoring of the
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>We assembled all the material submitted in the form of a catalogue of items
                    devoid of any editorial commentary or rationalization. I forwarded this massive
                    catalogue as a separate report to Washington. It contained over 5,500 instances
                    of use of library materials in the preparation of magazine or newspaper
                    articles, university theses, publications, etc. from all of Italy in that one
                    year.</p>
                <p>As you'll recall, many years later in 1971, Henry Loomis instructed me to do a
                    study of USIS library functions overseas. I searched high and low for a copy of
                    that 1955 report from Rome. It could not be found. We searched in the retired
                    Agency archives in Virginia. The original and any copies had simply
                    disappeared—a report that I had every reason to believe would be considered in
                    Washington to be one of the most impressive evidences of the effectiveness, not
                    merely of the library, but of the USIS organization itself ever produced.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>How could anyone have ignored all the implications of such a record? It had to
                    mean that an awful lot of people in Italy had turned to the USIS sources. It
                    meant a continuing and, in many cases, sustained relationship. Yet USIS Rome
                    never heard a word from Washington about the catalogue or any use made of it. I
                    was left to wonder whether anyone even looked at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't know about your study—and I'm trying to remember
                        the year in which I was sent out, also by Henry Loomis; it was either '71 or
                        '72—but at the time they had given me this “made” job (because I had come
                        into conflict with Mr. Shakespeare), to set up and direct a newly created
                        Resource Analysis Staff. One of the studies that Henry had asked me to do,
                        and I think it was in late '71, early '72, was to check on the utilization
                        of the libraries and the justification for their existence in several
                        places. I covered the Far East because that was my particular point of
                        interest. I sent two of my other people to other parts of the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And I think the whole thing traced back to the fact that Tom Sorensen, at one
                    point, back in the mid-60s, among other things, had come to the conclusion that
                    libraries are simply a frivolous use of our funds and ought to be curtailed;
                    that we had a lot of libraries that were operating, but who in the hell was
                    using them? That feeling tended to permeate throughout much of the Agency.</p>
                <p>That may account for the disappearance of your report on Italy's libraries. It
                    may, also, account for the fact that Henry wanted another check on them,
                    expecting to get an adverse report. Oleksiw was on the same wavelength. I came
                    back with a favorable report that they shouldn't be terminated, that they were
                    vastly important aspects of the program.</p>
                <p>MOCERI: If I may, sir, correct your historical recollection. You did that Far
                    East Study because I asked for it. And I incorporated it, as an appendix, in my
                    overall library report that Henry had asked me to do. The report was distributed
                    in the Agency under the date of September 1, 1971. And, as I recall, you and I
                    had some difference then, because you had the clear impression you had been
                    asked to do this library study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had been.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And I had the same impression because Henry had sent me a note on it,
                    instructing me to undertake it. Perhaps you had other things of higher priority
                    to do. As you may recall, I was then the head of that little unit that I
                    created, the Analysis and Evaluation Unit, in the Office of Research. I asked if
                    you would do the Far East because I was going to go to Europe and the Middle
                    East and South America. And, you know, obviously, your report became
                    incorporated in my 1971 study.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sometimes think Henry was not always aware that he gave
                        different people overlapping assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: But my point was here, with all the Agency talk about effectiveness was
                    one of the most important evidences of effectiveness. One could have gone to
                    Congress with the material and made an excellent case, because this was a list
                    not only of topics that showed the range of interest in the materials that we
                    provided but also of people who had actively used our resources.</p>
                <p>You know, these were certainly not the kind of library visitors that William
                    Buckley had in mind when he said in a USIA Advisory Committee meeting, airily
                    dismissing my library study, “Oh, people come in only to get cool because the
                    libraries are air-conditioned.” I'm sure Buckley hasn't changed his mind to this
                    day, because hard evidence held no interest for him in matters on which he had
                    formed an opinion, however groundless.</p>
                <p>Well, I suppose there are many other things I could say about my Italian
                    experience. I had had my share of frustrations and disappointments. I had
                    generally managed to keep these under control and in perspective. One
                    disappointment, however, cut quite deeply and certainly had a decided effect on
                    my Agency career. The position of deputy country PAO had been vacant since the
                    spring of 1955, when John McKnight and Ambassador Luce had had a parting of
                    ways. Having served for three months as acting country PAO, acting deputy
                    country PAO and acting chief information officer for a program as large as USIS
                    Italy, when Nordness returned to his office as Country PAO in September of that
                    year, I asked if he would consider nominating me for the position. He knew how
                    satisfied Mrs. Luce was with my performance and how well she thought of me. He
                    declined, adducing as his reason his conviction that in fairness to the Foreign
                    Service all officers should be expected to move up the career ladder step by
                    step. In October Mrs. Luce was in Washington on consultation. The Agency
                    approached her on the subject of the vacant position and suggested the name of
                    Charles Blackman as deputy to Nordness. Mrs. Luce accepted. In the meantime
                    Nordness had second thoughts and called Mrs. Luce in Washington to suggest my
                    name for appointment as his deputy. She told him that unfortunately she had just
                    accepted the Blackman designation. According to Nordness, she would gladly have
                    asked for my appointment to the position if Nordness had given her any hint of
                    his interest for he knew how well she thought of me and how willing she was to
                    do anything in reason for me. More than one person in Rome wondered why I never
                    asked Mrs. Luce for anything because there were those who sometimes referred to
                    me as “her fair-haired boy.” Frankly, I hated the very idea of being obligated
                    to anyone of superior rank for a favor.</p>
                <p>The Abortive Effort To Have A Prominent Italian Historian Writer Write A History
                    Of Clare Boothe Luce's Ambassadorial Period</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Another incident involving my relationship with Mrs. Luce may serve as a minor
                    historical or biographical footnote, because I don't think anybody else knows
                    about it. In the same summer of 1955, Mrs. Luce had expressed to me a desire to
                    have a reputable Italian writer do a thoughtful history of her ambassadorship in
                    Italy. I said I thought I could arrange this. Later, I arranged an appointment
                    with her office for her to meet my closest Italian friend, a young Italian
                    historian, Vittorio de Capra Riis. Vittorio de Capra Riis had been my earliest
                    Italian contact when I came to Italy.</p>
                <p>He was, at the time, Secretary to the Italian Institute for Historical Studies,
                    and probably the most promising historian of his generation. His specialty had
                    been in the history of political thought.</p>
                <p>In the intervening years, he had written an impressive volume on the origins of
                    democratic thought in France in the 16th century. He'd been in 1950 one of those
                    who'd urged me to talk about Charles Beard at USIS Naples because he knew about
                    my high respect for Beard as an historian. He wrote an excellent essay on Carl
                    Becker and became—in part as a result of our own conversations about American
                    historians—more and more interested in the history of American political
                    thought, as a major contribution to the general realm of democratic thought in
                    the modern world.</p>
                <p>I introduced Vittorio to Mrs. Luce. We had a wonderful meeting. He and I insisted
                    that he'd have to have open access to the records of the embassy. I felt this
                    was absolutely essential, because I saw it as a means of going beyond partisan
                    polemics to a genuinely valid American policy in Italy from the end of the war.
                    I felt we had nothing to be ashamed of and an accurate accounting would be very
                    creditable.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I think when Mrs. Luce realized that this young man was not going to
                    lend himself to a propaganda job but wanted to do a serious piece of research,
                    then she backed away—but very pleasantly. We all parted on very amicable
                    terms.</p>
                <p>The Proposed Oppenheimer Speech Incident, Nixed By Ambassador Luce</p>
                <p>This brings to mind one other episode involving Mrs. Luce. In 1954, the then
                    mayor of Florence was Giorgio La Pira, who really thought of himself in both
                    deed and spirit as a modern Saint Francis. “The red monk,” as he was called by
                    some including Mrs. Luce. A man who never had a lira in his pocket and on more
                    than one occasion had taken the coat off his back to give to a person he felt in
                    need. “The Communist Christian Democrat,” as he was sometimes called, decided to
                    organize a series of annual conferences on the use of atomic energy for world
                    peace. He was derided by many people for this kind of proposal. He was a
                    dreamer. He was the kind of person who could get 55,000 nuns around the world to
                    devote a day of prayer for the salvation of Stalin's soul because he believed in
                    the efficacy of prayer. He was serious about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>He came one day to my office (and subsequently we met in his office) to discuss
                    the possibility of American participation, because he felt that, without
                    American participation, that is, the participation of the leader in atomic
                    energy and possessors of nuclear bombing capability, his conference plan would
                    have no world resonance.</p>
                <p>I thought, “Well, this is an excellent opportunity for the Eisenhower
                    Administration to start mending fences with the scientific community in the
                    United States.” There had been, as you well remember, the great split with much
                    of that community over the Oppenheimer matter. Although it could be argued that
                    I was being guilty of unusual political naivete concerning American politics, I
                    felt instantly that La Pira's initiative could be used as a skillful ploy to get
                    us over a pretty rough period in relations with American scientists. The
                    American Government could simply designate Oppenheimer as the American speaker
                    for this conference, or let it be known that it had no objection to Oppenheimer
                    addressing this conference if he were invited by Mayor La Pira. Oppenheimer
                    would not even have to speak in the name of the American Government. What could
                    impress European intellectuals more at that time than to have the Eisenhower
                    Administration demonstrate its even-handedness and its respect for the
                    scientific mind.</p>
                <p>Well, through Ned Nordness I relayed the suggestion and my rationale to Mrs.
                    Luce, who apparently was just horrified by the thought of being the intermediary
                    for such a communication to Washington. [Laughter] It never happened, but I
                    still consider it a great political opportunity lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It could have worked in so nicely with our subsequent
                        Atoms for Peace exhibits all around the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Right. I remember that. There was one other episode, but I think that's
                    probably enough on Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Italy, I want to ask you one thing. Do you
                        know whether Lloyd Free ever reported to the political powers in the embassy

                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I have no idea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He probably did not, or if he did, he may have done so in

                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I think he was straightforward with me about it. And at that point, it
                    didn't make any difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it did not make any difference, but it would have
                        been interesting to find out. If he had reported your disagreement with the
                        consensus of the rest of the people about it, it might have had some effect.
                        I'm just wondering if he ever had the courage to bring it up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I don't know. All I can say, Lew, is that I think that the mind-set in
                    Rome was such, it was cast in concrete and there was no changing it. There was
                    no willingness to question anything about it.</p>
                <p>That also led to one of my firm convictions that stayed with me all through my
                    Agency career. For God's sake, never take all your assumptions for granted. Keep
                    questioning them. No matter how right they may seem to you, try to find out if
                    today, at this moment, in this particular situation, they really hold. Because I
                    think we'd have been so much better off if we had really recognized what was
                    going on.</p>
                <p>And we might not have taken whatever the Christian Democratic politicians were
                    telling us at face value. I know a lot was discounted, but...</p>
                <p>Return To An Incident In 1951: Reunion Of WWII Resistance Groups In Venice</p>
                <p>Let me go back to my first days in Italy, when I went as a Fulbright grantee,
                    because there is another episode that I would really like to be a matter of
                    record.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1951, the various resistance groups—World War II resistance
                    groups in Italy—decided to hold their first national meeting of the post-war
                    era. So they organized a conference in Venice. My close Neapolitan friends—a
                    group of five, who were known as the radicals of the south in democratic circles
                    in Italy—asked me to go up to Venice with them.</p>
                <p>I was delighted and eagerly looked forward to being in Venice. I thought, “Oh,
                    all the people I've read about, people who were active in the resistance
                    movement, are going to be there. And I can meet people like Leo Valiani, who was
                    a close friend of Arthur Koestler and figured prominently in one of Koestler's
                    novels. And meeting Ferruccio Parri, and all the other important figures in that
                    Italian resistance movement.”</p>
                <p>I hadn't thought about the question of American representation until I got there
                    and realized that I was the only foreigner at this meeting, in Venice, of all
                    the major figures of the Italian resistance movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I said to my self, “The people in the American Embassy in Rome have got to be out
                    of their minds. Are they so fearful of the communists that they don't want to be
                    seen in the same arena with them, for goodness sake?” Because, you know, the
                    communist propaganda line was that the communists really created and led the
                    Italian resistance movement. This line, historically speaking, was nonsense.
                    They played an important part, of course, because they were an important
                    political force. They'd been an active underground during the Fascist era. But
                    there were other groups, many other groups.</p>
                <p>And here I was the only foreigner on the scene. An American figure of prominence
                    in the Italian campaign of World War II, even as an unofficial representative,
                    would have had an electrifying effect on that audience in Venice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This beings me to two questions. Was Dunn the ambassador
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you had been in the USIS, at that time, rather than a
                        Fulbright grantee, you would have been expected to seek permission and you
                        probably would have been denied it. I'm not even sure that anybody from the
                        embassy political section would have been permitted to go, for the reasons
                        that you indicate; a fear of contamination by the Communist Party
                        representatives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dunn had a great reputation, but he was of the old school and a very conservative
                    man, whom I never knew at that time, but got to know slightly later.</p>
                <p>MOCERI: Oh, really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, I wouldn't have known what his reaction
                        would be. But I got to know him later, and I think that would have been the
                        reaction. Dunn was in his last days as Ambassador to Brazil when I went to
                        Rio in 1956. He had returned from retirement to replace Kemper, a political
                        appointee who had somewhat embarrassed the U.S. as Ambassador to
                        Brazil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I have no doubt. I have no doubt of that. We were victims of a
                    demonology. We thought in terms of demonology; so many of us did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't too far wrong in the Cold War. But, on the
                        other hand, we exaggerated our reactions and, apparently, we denied
                        ourselves many bits of information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Not only did we deny ourselves, but we also denied ourselves a positive
                    effect on groups that had some kind of kinship with us in their democratic
                    beliefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And we could have reinforced them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, perhaps, had some influence on the communists,
                        through that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Of course, of course. I mentioned earlier that Furio Diaz, the mayor of
                    Livorno, was looking for a way out, but he did not want to appear as, you know,
                    a captive of the Americans. He did not want to appear as if he owed a future,
                    his future, to the dominant political party, the Christian Democrats, or anyone
                    else. He wanted to be independent. He wanted it understood that he was his own
                    man. And this is, you know, very important in the political world.</p>
                <p>Moceri's Role In Establishing A Chair Of American History In The University Of
                    Florence</p>
                <p>Reflecting on what I have already said about my tour of duty in Florence, my
                    first in the Foreign Service, I ought to record here certain aspects of that
                    experience which may be of interest for the light they shed on my program
                    activities and my standing in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In 1954 USIS Rome called me to enlist my help in persuading the Ministry of
                    Education to establish a university chair in American history. Rome had tried
                    for two years without any success whatsoever. I reminded Rome that its goal was
                    utterly alien to the Italian academic tradition and would encounter, as they
                    must already have realized, intransigent academic and political resistance. In
                    the Italian university system only four cattedre, i.e., chairs or full
                    professorships, in the area of historical studies were recognized: ancient
                    history, medieval history, modern history and—the only national history—history
                    of the Risorgimento and Italian Unity. After many exploratory discussions with
                    most of my contacts in university circles, I had a series of meetings with
                    Giacomo Devoto, then Italy's most distinguished philologist and dean of the
                    faculty of letters at the University of Florence. Devoto was quite aware of my
                    links with Naples and Benedetto Croce. With considerable patience and in great
                    detail he outlined for my benefit the very lengthy, complicated, indeed tortuous
                    procedures that had to be followed to achieve the goal I had set for myself.
                    Under the best of circumstances it would take at least two years to move the
                    proposals through the various chains of authority in the Italian state's
                    bureaucratic universe. The very first and possibly most difficult hurdle was the
                    person of the professor of modern history. Without his consent the question
                    could not even be brought before the faculty of letters for a vote. That person
                    was Delio Cantimori, not only one of Italy's best historians but the most
                    distinguished intellectual in the fold of the Italian Communist Party. Thanks to
                    the diplomatic overtures of several friends, his consent was finally obtained.
                    And thanks to Devoto's unfailing support, the proposal completed its arduous
                    journey through all the necessary organs of the Italian government and was
                    approved two years later, not long before my departure from Italy.</p>

                <p>This represented my first effort to get direct Washington media support essential
                    to implement a program activity. It ended in a disaster. And here is the essence
                    of the story.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>In the early fifties Italians were among the most avid devotees of motion
                    pictures in the western world, partly as a momentary refuge from the taxing
                    struggles of daily existence, also as an inexpensive form of entertainment, and
                    finally as an interesting art form. It was a time when private film clubs,
                    sometimes numbering hundreds of members, began to flourish in many of the large
                    Italian cities. In 1953, Carlo L. Ragghianti, one of the most respected art
                    critics in Italy and a man who occupied a special status in Tuscan life because
                    he had been the leader of the armed resistance in Tuscany during World War II,
                    came to me with a fascinating proposal. As a prime mover in the organization of
                    film clubs, he wanted to build up their membership and stature in their
                    communities by offering in a multi-year cycle a comprehensive retrospective of
                    American films from the early twenties to the end of the forties. He would
                    provide the speakers to introduce and provide a context for each film. He would
                    also make the arrangements for panel discussions and interaction with the film
                    club audience. (Film clubs always arranged their showings in commercial movie
                    houses.) All he was asking me to do was arrange for the loan of the prints
                    necessary to sustain the proposed program. I was convinced that Ragghianti's
                    proposal offered an extraordinary opportunity to extend the range and depth of
                    USIS contacts in Tuscany and many other important urban centers of Italy.</p>
                <p>My initial communication and subsequent elaborations and arguments, made with the
                    knowledge of Frank Dennis, then the country PAO in Rome, were rejected out of
                    hand by the motion picture division in Washington. The day I reported into
                    Washington before beginning home leave in the summer of 1954, I was given a
                    message informing me to go to the office of Turner Shelton, head of IMV, the
                    next morning at ten o'clock. After cooling my heels for some time in IMV's
                    reception room that morning, I was summoned into the presence of Turner Shelton
                    to a blistering attack on my ignorance, incompetence and insolent
                    insubordination. It is easy to imagine how this affected my view of our
                    Washington media.</p>
                <p>Moceri's Relationship To The U.S. Consulate In Florence During The “Reigns” Of
                    Three Consuls General</p>
                <p>My relations with our consulate in Florence seemed to be entirely a function of
                    the personalities of the three consuls general under whom I served. I shall
                    summarize each case briefly, using a single example to show the relationship to
                    my role and standing in the course of my first assignment in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>1) Charles Reed, my first consul general, was an “old China hand” who probably
                    resented having been put out to pasture, however much the pleasures of life in
                    the upper reaches of Florentine society. His normal attitude was one of
                    disdain—and often amused contempt—for anything associated with USIS. When the
                    New York City Ballet made its first trip to Europe in 1953 and appeared in
                    Florence (its first city in Italy), the consul general instructed me to prepare
                    a guest list for the reception he was planning. I prepared a list of more than
                    200 names, representative of the range of our contacts with the artistic,
                    intellectual, political and media circles of Florence. Toward the end of that
                    reception Mrs. Reed, who was normally a quite reserved and sometimes aloof
                    person, came up to me and in a tone of genuine amazement said, “Why haven't I
                    met any of these people before.” A good question!</p>
                <p>2) Richard Service, John Service's younger brother and Charles Reed's successor,
                    was a classic example of the cool, reserved diplomat very conscious of his
                    status. That very attitude caused him to come a cropper in an incident involving
                    our Ambassador, Mrs. Luce, and me. Mrs. Luce was scheduled to come to Florence
                    for the opening of the first national exhibit of Italian arts and crafts. USIS
                    Rome failed to inform me of her departure time from Rome. After checking all
                    bases, I and my wife arrived separately at the station and met Mrs. Luce just as
                    she was getting off the train. Dick Service, of course, had been there a half
                    hour waiting for the Ambassador. As the two of them approached his car, he
                    invited her to have “a very quiet, private dinner a quatre. Her clearly audible
                    response was, “I'll accept only if you invite the Moceris.” That evening she
                    drove home her lesson with a vengeance; throughout the dinner she ignored Dick
                    Service completely and addressed all her conversation to my wife and me.</p>
                <p>3) Dale Fisher, Service's successor, was a different, younger breed. Several days
                    after his arrival he called me to the consulate and said he wanted to have the
                    benefit of my views of Italian politics. Over a period of several hours in the
                    course of a few days, he tape-recorded my analyses of the Italian and Tuscan
                    scenes.</p>
                <p>1956: Moceri's Attempt To Have A Washington Assignment Ends In Taiwan</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Well, so much for my Italian reminiscences. In 1956 I knew that if I remained in
                    the Italian program I could expect nothing more than a third tour of duty as a
                    branch PAO, regardless of Nordness's high regard for my capabilities. I also
                    sensed that there were people in the service who thought of me as a narrow
                    Italian specialist. More importantly, I was convinced that I had to learn and
                    understand a good deal about our Washington operations before returning to the
                    field in whatever position of responsibility. And I was very much concerned
                    about the problem of guiding my daughter, who was just turning sixteen after
                    seven continuous years in Italy, through a probably difficult reentry into
                    American life and the American school system. I expressed all these concerns to
                    Ned Nordness and emphasized that I needed a firm commitment that I would be
                    assigned to a position in Washington. In due course I received the assurances I
                    sought from Nordness. I left Italy at the end of 1956 with great regret,
                    especially in the wake of the Hungarian and Suez crises, but with peace of mind
                    over the prospect of a Washington assignment.</p>
                <p>My travel orders read “for home leave” to be followed by consultation in
                    Washington. When I returned to Washington in 1956, I was dismayed to learn from
                    the personnel office that there was no assignment for me in Washington. In fact
                    I was being scheduled to go to Bombay as the cultural affairs officer at that
                    branch USIS office. The news outraged me, and I boiled over with anger. I flatly
                    refused to go. Such a personnel action was utterly senseless. It was idiotic to
                    send me back into the field, still with so little knowledge of, let alone
                    experience in, Washington operations. My performance in Italy had been openly
                    praised by people whose opinion I valued. To the considerable satisfaction of
                    the country PAO and the Ambassador I had for more than three months managed and
                    in some respects improved a USIS country program with a staff of 48 officers
                    (almost all of whom outranked me) and a $6 million budget. Why in the world
                    should I accept a position ranking below the one I had occupied in Florence
                    (with all its complexities) for virtually five years? After much fruitless
                    discussion I was summoned to the office of the area director for the Near East
                    and South Asia, Hunt Damon. A lengthy, icy discussion failed to change my mind.
                    Ending the discussion, Damon angrily informed me that he would see to it that I
                    would regret my refusal to the end of my Agency career.</p>
                <p>While the Office of Personnel was working out my personnel problem, I was
                    assigned to a seminar on communist theory and practice. Nothing about that
                    three-week course, including the appearance of Lyman Kirkpatrick reputed to be
                    the governmental authority on communism, served to alter my rather low estimate
                    of the level of intellectual discourse in the Agency. I had, after all, spent a
                    rather considerable part of my graduate work on the political and intellectual
                    history of Europe in the 19th century, including the origins and growth of
                    Marxist thought and influence in pre-Fascist Italy; and I had lived for seven
                    years in virtually daily proximity to the communist presence, polemics and
                    threat to the democratic institutions of Italy.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Finally, the Director of Personnel, L.K. Little, called me in to inform me that I
                    was being offered an overseas assignment that took care of most of my previous
                    objection. The position was that of deputy PAO in Taipei. L.K. Little informed
                    me that the PAO, Ralph Powell, had such extraordinary access to the highest
                    levels of the Chinese Nationalist government that his intelligence information
                    and political advice were vitally important to the ambassador on a virtually
                    daily basis. This was summed up in the rather crude phrase, “Powell practically
                    sits on the Ambassador's lap.” The enormity of the claim would have been
                    apparent to anyone who had the slightest acquaintance with Ambassador Rankin. I
                    was also reminded how important all this and anything that strengthened this
                    relationship were to the success of the Dulles-Robertson policy on China. This
                    argument I found absurd: I had long held the opinion that our China policy was
                    as meaningless as the Dulles “rollback” policy for Eastern Europe. Nevertheless
                    I finally realized I had no realistic alternative. For once I received a decent
                    set of country program briefings from an area office, IAF, particularly from Jim
                    Halsema and Jack O'Brien. Everyone, especially George Hellyer, the Area
                    Director, impressed on me the importance to the Agency that I run the entire
                    USIS Taipei program on a daily basis for Ralph Powell. Unfortunately, I soon
                    learned, at no little cost to myself, nobody bothered to convey that
                    message—delicately or indelicately—to Powell.</p>
                <p>PAO Ralph Powell, Inexperienced In USIA, Made Relations Between Moceri And
                    Himself Delicate And Difficult</p>
                <p>After an exhausting 26-hour flight from Seattle (attributable to powerful
                    head-winds over the North Pacific) we arrived at the Taipei airport at 8:30 in
                    the morning. We were met by Powell and his wife. Powell rushed us through
                    customs because it was imperative that I be at the Ambassador's 9:00 o'clock
                    staff meeting. I never did understand why. Mrs. Powell insisted that after
                    checking into the Grand Hotel my wife begin her rounds of diplomatic calls that
                    very morning. When I asked for assistance in locating housing, both the Embassy
                    administrative office and Powell, himself, told me to check the English-language
                    China Post newspaper and have my wife order a pedicab through the hotel. If I
                    thought all this strange indeed, I was only beginning to learn how really weird
                    was the environment in which I would have to work.</p>
                <p>The USIS staff initially regarded me with some suspicion, the outsider, the
                    newcomer who had to prove himself to them. I quickly realized that I would have
                    to prove to each staff member, as tactfully as possible, that I knew his work
                    and the nature of his responsibilities as well as he did. And I soon learned
                    that with the exception of the executive officer every member of the American
                    staff was new to the Agency and on his first assignment. I found it
                    inconceivable and unconscionable that Washington could ever have allowed such a
                    situation to happen. Within weeks I felt I had won their confidence as they
                    began to understand that I cared about their work and their problems. Neither
                    then nor later was the Chinese staff a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Within days of my arrival I had my first intimation of the difficulties I would
                    have to anticipate in carrying out the USIS program in the name of Ralph Powell.
                    He came into my office one day holding in his hand a copy of a routine cable
                    from Washington on a rather minor program matter. He informed me that this was a
                    personal message to him from the Agency Director and I should handle the matter
                    in that context. I soon discovered that he indeed believed that any
                    communication from USIA Washington bearing the name of the Director was a
                    personally directed message to Powell. The day after his first trip away from
                    Taiwan since my arrival in Taipei he stormed into my office to accuse me of
                    concealing a telegram from him. I patiently explained why the Embassy system of
                    handling telegraphic traffic made it impossible to conceal a telegram for a
                    senior official. I realized that he found my explanation unpersuasive. Before
                    long Powell began accusing me openly and sometimes in the presence of others of
                    systematically turning the staff against him. Our relations became increasingly
                    strained during the rest of his tour. Because there was so much in the
                    relationship that struck me as irrational and almost unbelievable I decided
                    never to give as much as a hint of these problems to anyone in or from
                    Washington. Well after Powell's departure from Taipei, Jim Halsema told me
                    privately that IAF had been well aware of the difficulty and had been impressed
                    by the fact that I had maintained a total silence on the subject. And I mention
                    the matter here only because it is so illustrative of the consequences of errors
                    in personnel selection.</p>
                <p>Restructuring USIS Taipei's Program Objectives And Activities</p>
                <p>Despite these problems I did over time succeed in giving our USIS program some
                    shape, substance and coherence. I had to establish as an operational reality the
                    concept that USIS Taipei was not an appendage of the USAID to satisfy whatever
                    public relations whim it entertained. Learning that the single largest charge
                    against our program budget was the cost of publication materials extolling the
                    accomplishments of the Chinese Nationalist regime and sent to our Southeast Asia
                    posts for distribution to the overseas Chinese communities, I determined to
                    check this out with other S.E. Asian posts. Visits to those posts and
                    discussions with the PAOs convinced me that the materials were neither wanted
                    nor used. The most frequently adduced reason was that the host government for
                    nationalistic motives resented the distribution of such materials. I succeeded
                    in abolishing the program and diverted the funds to other program needs.</p>
                <p>The Chinese “Riots”—Embassy And USIS Destruction And Rebuilding</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Perhaps my most important and enduring accomplishment—certainly the most
                    time-consuming—was the design and refurbishing of new USIS facilities, both
                    expanding and increasing the efficiency of our program capabilities. In the wake
                    of the destruction of our USIS offices allegedly by a “rioting mob” just two
                    months after my arrival in Taipei, the Taipei regime eventually ceded to USIS
                    the use of the long-abandoned great fortress headquarters of the former Japanese
                    governors-general of Formosa. The huge building was in such a state of disrepair
                    that it had to be stripped to the skeleton frame and the entire interior
                    reconstructed to serve efficiently our staffing and programming requirements.
                    Because the Embassy building interior had been effectively wrecked in the same
                    incident, the Embassy administrative staff claimed it could give me no
                    assistance in the task establishing our new USIS headquarters. The entire burden
                    of that task fell on my shoulders: locating and hiring a local Taiwanese
                    architect-consultant, contracting for and supervising the extensive physical
                    alterations, establishing all our design needs, scouring and acquiring in the
                    Hong Kong markets all the furnishings and equipment. The final results were
                    judged even by the Embassy staff to be impressive and handsome.</p>
                <p>A word of explanation is required here to rectify the gross misconceptions
                    surrounding the incident in which the Embassy and USIS quarters were destroyed
                    on that Black Friday of May 1957 and the events leading to that incident. The
                    incident had its origin in an event that had occurred a very few weeks before:
                    an American sergeant had shot and killed a “Peeping Tom” Chinese coolie.
                    Publicly, it appeared to be a commonplace, minor tabloid story with only two
                    mildly titillating aspects, a glimpse of sex and the resulting confrontation of
                    a white American soldier and a non-descript Chinese male. The facts were quite
                    different: the Chinese was a colonel in the intelligence organization headed by
                    Chiang Ching-kuo, son of the President, and he had been shot in the back,
                    probably as a result of a quarrel over the division of spoils from an illegal
                    activity. A subsequent Ambassador's staff meeting dealt entirely with the
                    question of how to handle the episode discreetly and with the minimum damage to
                    American-Chinese relations. After listening to much discussion and very
                    conscious of my position as an absolute newcomer, I suggested and argued for a
                    two-step solution: first, the Embassy should make a formal apology to the
                    Chinese government, extend its deepest regrets to the widow of the colonel and
                    offer an appropriate monetary compensation in accordance with Chinese tradition
                    and practice; and second, the American should be tried as soon as possible in an
                    American court-martial in Taipei, found guilty of murder, removed immediately
                    from Taiwan, and at an appropriate time allowed to appeal the verdict in another
                    military jurisdiction. The Ambassador seemed at least interested in my proposal,
                    but the military present rejected it in the most vehement terms, draping
                    themselves in the honor of the American flag and the military code of
                    justice.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Within a very short time the court-martial, open to the public, was convened. A
                    verdict of “not guilty” was brought in. The Americans, the great majority of the
                    public present, rose to their feet and cheered. According to all reports, the
                    few Chinese present maintained a stunned silence. The next day, Black Friday,
                    the Chinese authorities took their revenge or, as I put it then, taught a lesson
                    the Americans could neither ignore nor forget. At about ten that Friday morning
                    a group of about twenty stalwart Chinese males, armed with crowbars, entered the
                    Embassy building and proceeded to smash everything in sight. A few Americans,
                    who tried to hide in the building rather than attempting escape, were injured.
                    In the meantime a large, orderly and very quiet crowd of Chinese gathered around
                    the perimeter of the Embassy ground to watch the unfolding spectacle. For that
                    day and the entire weekend the American community was rife with reports of a
                    rioting Chinese mob in the tradition of the anti-foreign Chinese riots around
                    the turn of the century. The American media, as far as I could tell, indulged
                    the same fantasy. There was not a shred of evidence of any rioting anywhere in
                    the city.</p>
                <p>On hearing of the activity at the Embassy, I decided to keep the USIS facilities
                    open as long as possible without endangering the staff or Chinese in our
                    facility. Late that afternoon at about four o'clock I was informed that the
                    Chinese “wrecking squad” (as I even then referred to it) was leaving the Embassy
                    and apparently was headed in the direction of our building. Quietly I ordered
                    our office closed, sent everyone home, secured the building and left the
                    premises at four-thirty. Half an hour later the wrecking crew arrived,
                    accomplished its mission and vanished. It could hardly escape my attention that
                    the USAID building was not a target. The following week I began an intensive
                    search for photographic evidence of the behavior of the Chinese crowd at the
                    Embassy. I soon had a collection of twenty or twenty-five photos, collected from
                    various sources. From that evidence the only conclusion that could be drawn was
                    that a group of perhaps two hundred Chinese men, women and children had gathered
                    or been gathered to watch—without the slightest sign of emotion—an interesting
                    spectacle. I sent all the photographs together with my report on the damages to
                    USIS to USIA Washington. When I left Taipei two years later and checked into
                    Washington, I asked about the photographs. They could not be found.</p>
                <p>Because I took very deliberate care not to circumvent my PAO, I saw little of
                    Ambassador Rankin during these events and for the remainder of his tour. My
                    impression was that at least outwardly he did not display the agitation and
                    outrage that much of his staff wallowed in.</p>
                <p>Aside: Relationship With Ambassador Rankin And Respect For His Judgment</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I had established, I thought, a good working relationship with him. I had
                    developed respect for the man because he was judicious and calm and, I think
                    most importantly, he knew what the limits of embassy influence really were. He
                    had no illusions on that score. On my final meeting with him, a courtesy call
                    just prior to his departure—I'm jumping ahead, now, chronologically—he said to
                    me, “This has been an interesting tour, but the decisions affecting the fate of
                    this island are not made here. They are made in Washington, Moscow, and Peking.”
                    Here was a man who understood clearly the limits of his power and the influence
                    of the American Embassy.</p>
                <p>Analysis Of Rising (Grass Roots) Elements Of A Democratic Order In Taiwan</p>
                <p>I mention this because I'd been urged by members of the political section of the
                    embassy to turn my attention and USIS activities to the Taiwanese people, as
                    distinguished from the mainlander Chinese, and convince them about the value of
                    democracy and the institutions of democracy and so on, and how America was
                    really their friend. All of which, I regarded as utter nonsense, because there
                    was no way that the Chinese Government was going to allow me to approach the
                    Taiwanese population, which, at that point, was being held down very, very
                    firmly.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there were taking root within that society, a number of rather
                    important democratic patterns or practices, at any rate. These became possible
                    because Chinese mainlanders were carrying out in Taiwan what they failed to do
                    on the mainland: a very aggressive and effective land reform program, and
                    setting up agricultural cooperatives, because no peasant could own more than
                    approximately three acres of land.</p>
                <p>The agricultural economy had to have credits if it was to rise above the
                    subsistence level, feed a burgeoning population and generate foreign exchange.
                    Through the cooperatives, the farmers themselves started pressing for measures.
                    They needed credits. They needed fertilizer. They needed seed and tools. And
                    pressuring the Chinese Government—the Chiang Kai-shek government—brought them
                    such returns. This was democracy in action at that level. It was shaping the
                    practice of democratic discussion and debate and the arts of exerting pressures
                    on governmental entities. I regarded that as something that had to come out of
                    the soil of Taiwan itself. It was not something any USIS operator was going to
                    instruct a foreign populace about. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Chiang Kai-shek government at all responsive to
                        those pressures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: They had to be, because they needed the food supplies for them and for
                    the fastest growing population in the world and they needed the export
                    earnings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they really did give them some break, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Oh yes, they did. And that is why the Taiwanese nationalists, who called
                    for the overthrow of the government and so on, all from the safe haven of the
                    Japanese islands, were, I think, off base. Democratic practice cannot be imposed
                    even by an exile movement, because the democratic practice has to have grass
                    roots. It has to be born in the soil and be nurtured in the soil, in the land
                    and the spirit of a nation. And in Taiwan of the fifties it was slowly, in this
                    way, forming. And we can see the evolution of this process even now for I think
                    what is happening in Taiwan today goes back to those early roots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say, that was laying the groundwork
                        and the foundation for the economic miracle that has been wrought in
                        Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Precisely, you see. Because it was those exports, the exports of that
                    food, because they proved capable of producing far more than the needs of the
                    island, far more. You know, they could routinely get three crops of rice every
                    year. This fueled the exporting to Japan and to Korea and so on.</p>
                <p>An interesting aspect—another aspect that I'd seen—of the agricultural
                    revolution, was that the landlords, the great 300 families—and I don't know
                    whether they were 300 more, plus or minus something—were given what seemed to be
                    worthless bonds by the Chinese Government. These were, in effect, holdings in
                    paper enterprises that then became the capitalist vehicles responsible for
                    creating the light industry of Taiwan. These were the people who then became the
                    owners and managers of the new industrial enterprises.</p>
                <p>So there's a displacement of a class. And that displacement eventually created
                    the opportunity for a different type of economic adventure, which then became
                    the basis for Taiwan's remarkable industrialization, none of which people in
                    '57, '58, and '59, when I served in Taiwan, could have foreseen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only could they not foresee it, but I don't think they
                        fully understand, yet, what the base of that sudden explosion of industrial
                        accomplishment has been or from what it came. I don't think it's fully
                        realized to this day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, that leads me into another thought. I wanted to get...</p>
                <p>Demise and Departure of Ralph Powell</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you get into the other thought, just as a matter of
                        curiosity, where was Ralph Powell in all this, during that time? And what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, Ralph Powell's tour came to an abrupt end in 1958, during the Far
                    Eastern Ambassador's Conference, which that year was held in Taipei. George
                    Hellyer came out. Drumright was then the ambassador. The director of the Agency
                    came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time, Larson had probably been replaced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, he'd been replaced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was George Allen that came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the new director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, I had asked my wife to set up a luncheon for Allen and Hellyer and
                    the entire USIS staff at our house. We had luncheon there, in a fairly modest
                    house, prepared by Modesta. And we knew, we all sensed at that luncheon, that
                    all was not well. Of course, Powell was there.</p>
                <p>What happened? About midway in the conference, Drumright called in George Hellyer
                    and George Allen and said, “I want this man removed and I want him removed
                    immediately.”</p>
                <p>Well, then it couldn't be done during the conference, so they asked for a week's
                    time to get him out. Drumright simply could not tolerate him. He wanted him out
                    of his hair. Now, I think that both Allen and Hellyer, reluctantly, had to abide
                    by his request because Ambassador Drumright said he'd take it up with the
                    Secretary of State if they weren't prepared to satisfy his wishes. That marked
                    the end of Ralph Powell's career in Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it marked the end of his career in USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, it was very brutal and very sad, in a way. I'd had terrible
                    difficulties but, you know, I felt sorry for the man. But I later learned that
                    we as a government do not do these things very gracefully. [Laughter] I learned
                    that, particularly, in the Kennedy Administration, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then did you become the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MOCERI: I was made acting PAO. So I functioned with that transitory title for the
                    remainder of my tour because, I think, Drumright may have made it known he
                    wanted eventually to bring in USIS people he knew. And after the Quemoy crisis
                    broke out, he brought in Dick McCarthy on a special detail and John Bottaeff as
                    his deputy. I was phasing out, by that time. They were there, presumably, to
                    help. But I couldn't quite understand why I needed that help. [Laughter] I and
                    my information officer, Lucien Agniel, could have managed quite well. I knew the
                    problems and knew something of the Quemoy crisis and the reasons for it and what
                    the Chinese were trying to do.</p>
                <p>Earlier Episodes of Disputes With Ralph Powell And DCM (then Charg�) Pilcher</p>
                <p>Now I am reminded that I must refer to certain earlier episodes including a
                    terrible dispute with Ralph Powell and the deputy chief of mission, a man named
                    Pilcher, who was our charg� d'affaires for the period between Rankin's departure
                    and Drumright's arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Jim Pilcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Jim Pilcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been the supervising consul general in Japan when
                        I was in Japan, 1952-56. So I knew Jim very well. A Georgian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, I don't know what your feelings are, so I hope you won't be
                    offended by anything I say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I liked him personally, but I had reservations about his
                        capabilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: One of my early introductions to official American attitudes toward the
                    Chinese occurred at an evening in Pilcher's home with the director of Chinese
                    information and several other dignitaries, Powell, and myself. I was appalled to
                    hear Pilcher, at one point, as we sat around after dinner, telling the Chinese
                    about the glories of their own civilization and how civilized they were when we,
                    in the West, were still swinging from the trees by our tails. You know, this is
                    not conversation at some casual bar. This is the American deputy chief of the
                    American mission, talking to a representative...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Representative of the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MOCERI: ...foreign government. I'd never heard anything like this in my life. I
                    couldn't believe what I was hearing. And I thought to myself, “Well, this is a
                    consequence of the Dulles-Robertson line. We have to kowtow, in the traditional
                    terms, to representatives of the Chinese Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Ralph Powell say to that, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Nothing. Nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Nothing. When I gave vent to my surprise the next day, he couldn't
                    understand what I thought was wrong about this. Now I really began to wonder
                    whether it was really to be my fate in the foreign service to be repeatedly
                    caught up in some very odd situations. I must recall here a couple of the odd
                    things that had happened to me in Italy. An inspector-general recommended in
                    1953 that I be sent back to the United States for re-Americanization—a
                    recommendation based solely on a conversation during the course of a luncheon
                    that he arranged for me to have with him in Rome, in a cafe in Rome. The
                    luncheon was to be in place of the inspection he had not done at my post in
                    Florence because his wife had wanted to use that day for shopping. He started
                    out with a question about Italian politics. So I proceeded to lay out for him
                    all the essential elements of the Italian political structure and what was
                    happening in the world of Italian politics. Assuming from the questions he kept
                    addressing to me that he really wanted to know something of the political
                    geography of Italy I went on at some length. And on that basis, he decided that
                    I was much too involved in Italian affairs, I reflected an Italian attitude and
                    needed to be re-Americanized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the inspector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Fred Oechsner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think I knew Fred.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: He had been head of the AP bureau in Berlin, if I'm not mistaken, in the
                    30s. A very fine gentleman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the public member of the inspection team?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MOCERI: No, he was with the State Department. He was the State Department
                    inspector with the responsibility of inspecting USIS activities in Italy. There
                    was no team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Then later, before leaving Washington for Taipei, a woman in the Office
                    of Personnel suggested I look in my personnel file. That's how I learned about
                    this. I also learned that after I had been in Rome as acting country PAO for
                    three months—or at that time, and in spite of what people knew about my
                    relationship with Mrs. Luce—an Embassy panel sitting in Rome had recommended
                    that I be discharged from the Service.</p>
                <p>Two Clashes With PAO Ralph Powell And DCM Pilcher</p>
                <p>At any rate, these incidents may help, in fact, to understand why I took so
                    intransigent a position in two clashes that I had with Ralph Powell and Pilcher
                    over what I viewed as the proper execution of my own responsibilities. I invoked
                    my rights, as a Foreign Service officer, to report to Washington what I had
                    observed and been told, that was of direct concern to U.S. policy interests.</p>
                <p>One of the reporters—I don't want to confuse names, so I'll leave them
                    unnamed—had been given very rough treatment by the Chinese Government. He had a
                    solid reputation as one of the best American correspondents in the Far East.
                    Based in Hong Kong, he had come to Taipei to cover Taiwanese developments in a
                    series of articles for the New York Times. The Chinese did everything to keep
                    him from getting out of his hotel in Taipei.</p>
                <p>I thought, you know, “This is idiotic on the part of the Chinese.” Here is a
                    correspondent who has an excellent reputation in the Far East. And he's writing
                    for the most important newspaper in the United States. Give him assistance. You
                    know, maybe there are certain things you don't want him to get into, but there
                    are ways of handling this.</p>
                <p>He was absolutely livid. He had planned to spend a considerable amount of time on
                    this particular assignment. And he realized that they weren't going to let him
                    get out of Taipei for anything. He voiced his complaints to our press officer,
                    Lucien Agniel. Agniel came to me with this story and I said, “Well, this has got
                    to be reported. It's too serious. Washington ought to know about this. Because,
                    obviously, the correspondent is going to get in touch with his home office. And
                    there are going to be inquiries. Both USIA and the Department ought to be aware
                    of this.”</p>
                <p>Well, neither Powell nor Pilcher would let me send the message. I had drafted it
                    over my signature and I wanted it forwarded. Well, I insisted on what I felt
                    were my right as a Foreign Service officer and said, “Look, I'll file a protest
                    on this.” So they gave in and finally sent it in.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Not very long after that the question of Drumright's appointment as ambassador to
                    Taipei came up. The Chinese Government had given its agr�ment to his
                    appointment, but he made some unfortunate remarks in Hong Kong, before coming to
                    Taipei. Reportedly he had indicated that the Nationalists would not find him the
                    soft touch that Rankin had been. They'd find him very hard to deal with. They
                    certainly weren't going to get the fighter planes that they'd asked for and that
                    Rankin had promised them. Rankin was great at delaying tactics and he just kept
                    delaying, delaying, delaying, which was proper because they couldn't take
                    offense at that. He'd cite complications, difficulties, bureaucratic procedures,
                    all kinds of reasons, you see.</p>
                <p>Well, obviously, the Chinese in Taipei got wind of what was being said in Hong
                    Kong. They had very good sources in Hong Kong. They came to Lucien Agniel and me
                    to express their dismay and their disappointment. The editor of the Chinese
                    Post, which was the local English-language paper, and other informal emissaries,
                    were sent to the two of us.</p>
                <p>So I drafted a message about this and wanted to send it to both State and USIA.
                    Obviously, this development had to be of concern. Washington has to know about
                    these things. The Chinese had wanted very deliberately and quite unofficially to
                    get their unhappiness on the record. It was inconceivable to me that the
                    information I had should or could be withheld from Washington. Our people there
                    had to know that, as I put it, “there's a buildup of resentment here and this is
                    a problem that's going to have to be dealt with.”</p>
                <p>Powell and Pilcher categorically refused to let me send the message. We had a
                    long, heated argument, which degenerated into a shouting match. I had stopped
                    smoking; it had been three years since the last smoke. When Powell accused me of
                    treason—and the word “treason” was used—I was so outraged that I smoked three
                    cigars and two packs of cigarettes that day. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I promptly wrote an undated letter of resignation. I said, “I want this letter to
                    be on the ambassador's desk, Drumright's, when he arrives. If he thinks my
                    action has been wrong he can put a date on it, and my resignation will be
                    effective as of that date.” I said, “I can't work like this.”</p>
                <p>Well, you can imagine the acrimony. They finally came up with a shrewd,
                    diplomatic solution for the problem, because I was so adamant. They said they
                    would send my message to Drumright in Hong Kong. And then Drumright could do
                    with it as he pleased. Well, on that I caved in because I felt I couldn't—beyond
                    a shadow of a doubt—call them liars. I didn't believe they would, but I also
                    couldn't prove that they wouldn't. So the matter ended there.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>You can imagine the acrimony on both sides. And I thought, you know, here was
                    another bitter lesson to me on the problems of getting distasteful information
                    back to Washington. It's a question of reporting—what do you report? Do you
                    report only what the people in Washington want to hear? Or what needs to be
                    known? And I felt my information needed to be known. The ambassador needed to
                    know it. And the State Department needed to know that there was Chinese
                    resentment. It wouldn't have taken much to figure this out.</p>
                <p>Well, I'm, I suppose, casting the net of my recollections too wide for you. But I
                    think USIS officers do find themselves in positions like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And this raises some real questions. This is why I always felt we should
                    be integrated with the State Department. There should not be the division
                    between the political and the information, cultural; we should be integrated
                    physically and functionally, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, I don't thoroughly agree with you on this
                        point. I think that had you been within the Department, you would have been
                        subject to the same kind of repression and, perhaps, more so, because then
                        you would have been in deliberate opposition to and in contravention of your
                        superiors' recommendations and decisions. I don't think you'd have been as
                        well off as you were as an independent. And that, of course, was the whole
                        basis for the separation of State and USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: You may be quite right about this, in terms of the practicalities of the
                    problem. But my experience, as other experiences I've had, do raise this
                    question as a problem that has to be addressed, and addressed in fairness to the
                    United States Government itself. It has to be addressed in whatever other kind
                    of relationship is established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that the situation is not nearly as bad today as
                        it was 25 or 30 years ago. What you were seeing, at that time, was the last
                        gasp of a whole bunch of the old-line ambassadors, many of whom you know
                        were holdovers from the pre-war years. They were ending their careers, and
                        they felt like that. And that's the way they were always going to feel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The newer ambassadors, who have come on since, and that includes some of the
                    political ambassadors, have been much more accommodating; not only
                    accommodating, they have insisted that USIA take a very definite role in the
                    determination of policy and in the explanation of what was going on. And they
                    have respected the PAO's analyses, sometimes to the detriment of the political
                    section.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>So I don't think that the condition holds to the same extent today that it did
                    then. But I, also, encountered situations where you, simply, could not make a
                    recommendation to an ambassador. He would not have it. That was all there was to
                    it. And one of our best PAOs, Willard Hanna, who was in Japan at the time,
                    resigned over that very kind of a conflict with John Allison, when Allison was
                    ambassador there.</p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, to the second of the two episodes worth mentioning: the Open Skies
                    exhibit. I insisted that the Agency was promoting it for all it was worth. It
                    was very important to us. I insisted that we schedule this exhibit. I went over
                    considerable opposition on everyone's part in the embassy. I did stage the
                    exhibit. And the Chinese were fascinated by it; fascinated by the photography
                    involved, and the potential of the Open Skies exhibit.</p>
                <p>See, there again, determined opposition. The Chinese information office finally
                    agreed to it. And we did have it. And it was, probably, the most successful—in
                    terms of audience attendance—the most successful exhibit we ever staged in
                    Taiwan. This leads me quite naturally into mentioning the assessment that the
                    Chinese made of my own position and work there. Shortly before I left, two CIA
                    officers—you know, there was CIA all over the place...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their CIA or our CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Our CIA. [Laughter] And they came to me and they said, “Now that you're
                    leaving, you may be interested in what the Chinese think of you. And we've
                    talked to a lot of officials.” I assumed they had. [Laughter] By the way, Ray
                    Cline was the head of the CIA operation in Taiwan at the time.</p>
                <p>And these two said to me, “They say you're a very hard man to deal with. But
                    you're also very fair. You won't do anything that you're not convinced is in the
                    interest of your government. But the one thing they like is that they can count
                    on your word. If you've said you'll do something, you do it.” I thought it was
                    high praise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you say, “Would you put that in writing?”
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I never thought of that at the time. [Laughter] Well, from there I went—I
                    thought I was going back to the States. I had talked to Bill Copeland, who was
                    at the moment our new area director, then visiting us in Taipei on his first
                    visit to his field posts. He wanted to know what I wanted to do. This was the
                    first time any Washington official had expressed an interest in what I might
                    like to do in terms of possible assignments. So I told him about the things I
                    wanted. He asked me to write a memorandum to him, sort of a personal letter,
                    outlining my background and my interests and what I would like to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>You know, I considered myself, I believed what I was told when I came into the
                    Agency, “You're available on a worldwide basis.” I felt it wasn't up to me to
                    stay in one particular area. I certainly welcomed the prospects of experience in
                    different parts of the world.</p>
                <p>The problem with that is that you don't build up the ties with a group of people
                    who gravitate in a given area, as in South America, for instance. You remember
                    that for all practical purposes we had a Latin American junta in the Agency that
                    made South America its province.</p>
                <p>1959: Assignment To The Naval War College</p>
                <p>I thought I was open-minded on the subject of possible assignments. I left Taipei
                    in April of 1959. I assumed that this time I would really get an assignment to
                    Washington. But there was a sudden change. USIA had nominated somebody for the
                    Naval War College as a USIA representative at the War College for the 1959-60
                    academic year and I guess the fellow withdrew. I don't know what happened to
                    him. I went on home leave still thinking that I would finally get a Washington
                    assignment. I was informed of my assignment to the War College by a phone call
                    from Washington virtually at the end of my home leave in the Seattle area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Newport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Newport. So I had a year at Newport, which was important to me for
                    several reasons, but especially for the war gaming experience. They had war
                    games while I was there, two major war games. It had been my first real contact
                    in the post-war era with the military. There were a lot of naval officers, Air
                    Force people, and Army, all of the rank of lieutenant commander or commander, or
                    the equivalent and all potential candidates for senior command positions in the
                    military.</p>
                <p>At The Naval War College: Two War Games Moceri Acts Contrary To “Rules”</p>
                <p>In the two war games I was always assigned to the red team. I learned a lot, a
                    lot about American obsessions and preoccupations. In the first war game, I was
                    to act the role of the Soviet foreign minister. We, as Soviets, had moved planes
                    and troops into Iraq. And this had caused considerable disturbance among US
                    policy makers. The whole idea was to bring the two superpowers into a clash, an
                    armed clash—over Middle East affairs.</p>
                <p>Well, I didn't want to play that game because a conflict could not be in the
                    Soviet interest. So I started organizing meetings, conferences, calls on de
                    Gaulle, calls on the papacy, appealing to this or that body—all kinds of
                    delaying tactics, to stall the Americans. Well, nothing developed because I
                    flooded the control group with messages and a variety of diplomatic
                    proposals.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Well, it got so bad that the blue team just decided, “We're going to finish
                    this.” They launched their attack, a nuclear attack, to which my red team
                    responded, the Soviets responded, of course. In the exchange, the Soviet Union
                    practically disappeared, for all practical purposes, from the face of the earth.
                    I happened to be one of the survivors. Also, 100 American cities were destroyed.
                    And the United States lost 120,000,000 people.</p>
                <p>So I said, you know, “Look, all you have achieved is a Pyrrhic victory! This
                    isn't any victory for you because what is emerging from all this wreckage is an
                    American society transformed beyond all recognition. It's not the society you
                    defended.” The exercise taught me a lesson about American impatience.</p>
                <p>All right, you could say it's just an exercise. But in the exercise military
                    officers became so exasperated they finally went ahead with a nuclear response.
                    It's the sort of thing that can happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. It could very well have happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And as the lessons were digested and I talked with the officers on our
                    team, I said, “This is one of the things we've got to be concerned about. All I
                    was doing was making it difficult by engaging, really, in just the normal
                    practices of diplomacy, exhausting them to the limit. But this is what we've got
                    to be prepared to face. And my appeals to de Gaulle and the Pope and so on, they
                    were all calculated maneuvers. And there could have been responses to those
                    maneuvers.”</p>
                <p>The second war game involved Vietnam. And the rules were set up for an invasion
                    of Vietnam by the Chinese First Army. I was assigned as the political advisor to
                    the Chinese commander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Of the Chinese Army. We were given certain conditions under which we had
                    to move our troops a certain way. I said, “The Chinese will never do this.
                    They'll never move their troops like this.” I refused, arguing, “In this kind of
                    terrain you want this sort of thing? You think the Chinese are going to move as
                    if this was the plains of Europe?”</p>
                <p>Well, again, we lost that one. [Laughter] But I learned another lesson. And I
                    thought of Vietnam. I first said, “The Chinese would never act like this, for
                    goodness sake. You are being totally unrealistic. Your military have to consider
                    how your opponents think and how they function and what their constraints are,
                    including such things as their traditions and patterns of behavior.”</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>And I remembered what I told my Italian friends, in 1954, after the fall of Dien
                    Bien Phu. I said, “One day we're going to go in and we're going to have 1,000
                    times the power of the French. And we're going to commit errors because we're
                    going to show the French how to do it. We're going to commit errors on a scale
                    1,000 times worse.” So now you know how I felt about Vietnam. To me it was the
                    tragedy that was simply waiting to happen.</p>
                <p>1960: Assigned To USIA Office Of Policy And Plans</p>
                <p>From there, then, I was recruited into the Office of Policy and Plans, IOP, by
                    Jim Halsema who as program officer in IAF had been thoroughly familiar with my
                    work in Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, I went...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '60?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: '60 I reported to Washington, in the last months of the Eisenhower
                    Administration, as a deputy to Jim Halsema, who was the director of plans, in
                    the Office of Policy and Plans. It was my first real taste of Washington. I once
                    had an earlier experience that left a bad taste. A couple of people had come to
                    me and said that I should get into the Soviet area, the research area, because
                    this was the elite corps of the Agency. “Elite corps” was a term I didn't want
                    to hear for even in the late thirties I had always associated the phrase with
                    Nazi Germany. I didn't want to have any part of it. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Critical Evaluation Of Country Papers</p>
                <p>At any rate, Jim gave me my first task. He wanted me to read all the country
                    plans as they came in, and do critiques on them. I think I was the first, and
                    possibly the only, agency officer to read every single country plan submitted
                    from the field in a given fiscal year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably. You know, when I was acting director of the
                        Latin American area, I read every single country plan out of the Latin
                        American area, and wrote critiques on them. That was in 1958-9.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. It was for me a revealing experience, because I came to the
                    conclusion that, for most PAOs, country plans were no more than an exercise in
                    boilerplate language to pacify Washington. For instance, you'd get something
                    from Pakistan that went on interminably about such things as the commonality of
                    cultural interests, heritage and the kind of world we both wanted. Come on, now.
                    Let's have some sense of geography and history and the differences among people.
                    Sure, they may have an interest in peace and we have. But their conception of
                    peace is not necessarily our conception of peace, and so on.</p>
                <p>Well, I felt then that, at least under the rules of the time, this was really
                    almost a meaningless exercise. All kinds of inconsistencies and repetition. All
                    the right words were there, whatever was considered acceptable to the Agency.
                    And seldom did I see, in any of the country plans, an attempt to come to grips
                    with the real problems of the country, our problems in the country. So that was
                    an illuminating experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after you had done that, and expressed your opinion,
                        as I presume you did, what was the reaction of Halsema and the policy
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, Halsema sent my rather extensive critiques to the area offices. And
                    that was the end of it. I suppose there may have been a few instances in which
                    area people took into account my observations on a given plan. I think in most
                    cases they simply ignored my critiques because I don't think the office of plans
                    enjoyed much prestige or influence in the Agency at that point. I think it
                    tended to be dismissed. You know, there was no Andy Berding sitting up at the
                    top there. Of course, I never worked for him, so I don't know what he was really
                    like as a person and operator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andy was very well respected, but he didn't last very long
                        because Dulles pulled him over to be the Assistant Secretary of State for
                        Public Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, of course, that was the tail end of the Eisenhower Administration.
                    Throughout those months I was increasingly appalled by all the elaborate
                    psychological warfare paraphernalia and so on, the things that were coming out
                    of the Eisenhower White House, in terms of requirements. The laying out of 50
                    objectives for a country and what agency or element had this role or that role,
                    and so on. It was frankly a meaningless paper exercise. I think too much time
                    has been spent in the Agency on this kind of paper exercise, without addressing,
                    in fact, avoiding the real problems that every mission faces overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the Policy Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1961: Kennedy Takes Office; Tom Sorensen Becomes Deputy Director for Policy And
                    Plans</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Until October 1962. With the Kennedy Administration Tom Sorensen came in
                    as head of IOP. Tom Sorensen, obviously looked on Jim Halsema and me as relics
                    of the Eisenhower Administration. And, I guess, Jim got out—I forget now where
                    he went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he go to Cairo then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, he went to Cairo, which I thought was a very good assignment for
                    him. And, I guess, for a time at least I was useful, in the sense that I knew
                    the staff and what things were in the works. And I, actually, had to—it ended up
                    that I was acting as a buffer between Tom and a staff that he didn't
                    particularly like—sometimes to the point of open contempt.</p>
                <p>He brought in Bob Lincoln as his special assistant. One day Lincoln came to me
                    and wanted to give me some advice. Quite simply, I had to get myself and the
                    rest of the staff moving as Tom wanted. I said, “You're asking me to kiss
                    ass.”</p>
                <p>“Well, if you want to put it that way.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I won't do it. I believe in calling the shots as I see them. I'll
                    tell Tom what I think. I think Tom has to know that that's what I will do.” Tom
                    always hacked up all the draft memoranda that I prepared for his signature, but
                    that is all right. You know, everybody has different editorial preferences. One
                    person likes this style of writing and another person likes something else.</p>
                <p>At this point let me backtrack for a moment in order to keep straight in my mind
                    the chronology of events during the period I served under Tom Sorensen straight
                    in my mind.</p>
                <p>In the final weeks of the Eisenhower Administration, Jim Halsema asked me to
                    prepare a set of proposals for new USIA program initiatives to be submitted to
                    the incoming administration for its consideration. I saw this as a welcome
                    invitation to put forward a number of ideas growing out of my field experience
                    and especially out of my recent months of familiarization with USIA Washington
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Moceri Memo Of Recommendation For The New Agency Management</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Over a matter of a couple of weeks I prepared a very lengthy memorandum
                    incorporating some sixteen or eighteen proposals that the new deputy director
                    for IOP ought to consider. Three of the proposals I still recall because I then
                    thought and even now think of them as essential to the proper execution of our
                    Agency's mission: a new Agency magazine, possibly a quarterly, to be called
                    PROBLEMS OF DEMOCRACY, for world-wide distribution and devoted to analyses of
                    contemporary democratic experience anywhere in the world; the organization on a
                    permanent basis of a summer-long orientation program at several regional centers
                    in the United States for foreign students coming to American universities on
                    government grants, with foundation or private assistance or even their own
                    family resources; and the establishment of a special resource center for a
                    critical USIA audience, foreign correspondents in the United States. All these
                    proposals were presented in considerable details in terms of both their
                    justification and their implementation.</p>
                <p>One day Tom Sorensen called me into his office to discuss my memorandum. I saw it
                    lying on his desk and could not help but note that it had been subjected to
                    extensive editing. I assumed that he was revising it to make both form and
                    content to suit his style prior to forwarding it to Ed Murrow and Don Wilson.
                    Whether he ever did I do not know; at any rate I never saw my memorandum again.
                    In our discussion Tom mentioned only two of my many proposals. He dismissed the
                    idea of a summer orientation program for foreign students on the grounds that it
                    was really none of the Agency's business and anyway it would cost too much. He
                    was definitely interested in the proposal for a foreign correspondent's resource
                    center. He did succeed in bringing about the establishment of the USIA press
                    centers in Washington and New York for the foreign correspondents corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that would have been his kind of a ball park.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. And so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was action right away.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. Much later I occasionally wondered whether my proposal for a
                    Problems of Democracy magazine might have been the source of the thinking that
                    led to the establishment of our DIALOGUE magazine under the editorship of Nathan
                    Glick. I deeply regretted the failure to pick up on my proposal concerning
                    foreign students in the United States. Increasingly in my overseas experience I
                    worried about the thousands of foreign students going to American universities
                    with little or no background or orientation on American society and life, the
                    American university system—and all too often a command of English not at all
                    adequate to the demands of a rigorous schedule of university studies. If USIA
                    could organize through foundations, universities and other private channels
                    summer orientation programs of four to ten weeks duration at regional centers
                    around the country, where university plants were being under-utilized, we might
                    succeed in having an incalculable long-term influence on the 60,000 or so
                    foreign students in the United States each year. Looking back on the thirty-odd
                    years that have transpired since I made those proposals, I can't help wondering
                    how their implementation might have affected the range and depth of our
                    influence on other societies.</p>
                <p>March, 1962: Defense Department Annual Report Changes Strategy From Massive
                    Retaliation To Graduated Response</p>
                <p>In March of 1962, the comptroller-general of the Defense Department sent to
                    Congress his required annual report. It was far from a routine report. It was
                    fraught with far-reaching implications, as I realized when a copy of the report
                    crossed my desk. It effectively signaled the abandonment of the strategy of
                    massive retaliation in favor of a new doctrine of graduated response. When I had
                    read the entire report, I felt it was of such crucial importance and complexity
                    that intensive briefings should be held for all elements of the Agency,
                    particularly the media, in Washington. I went in to Tom Sorensen to give my
                    reaction and suggestion for Agency handling of the report. I ended my remarks by
                    stating that this was the most important policy document issued by the Kennedy
                    administration since its inauguration. Tom looked at me with an expression that
                    seemed to suggest I was slightly “off my rocker.” His only remark was, “We'll
                    see about that.” With that he picked up the phone and called his brother Ted,
                    the special advisor to the President. Then and there I realized that, whatever
                    was being said or thought of Tom in the corridors of the Agency, this direct
                    link between the head of IOP and the office of the Special Advisor to the
                    President could be of enormous importance to the Agency. After a brief exchange
                    on the phone Tom turned to me and said, “You're right.” That ended our
                    conversation. And no briefings were given along the lines that I had
                    suggested.</p>
                <p>April, 1962: Sorensen Shunts Moceri Out Of IOP To Be Head Of Press Coverage Team
                    For UN 18-Nation Disarmament Conference, And Full Member Of U.S. Delegation</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>It was clear that Tom really didn't want to have me there as his deputy or even
                    as a member of the IOP staff. He brought in Burnett Anderson and I was shunted
                    aside, out of the chain of command, without any assigned responsibility until
                    the end of my two-year tour of duty in Washington when I could readily be
                    shipped out to the first available overseas post. In the meantime I could be
                    used for a number of temporary tasks.</p>
                <p>In April, 1962 (I believe the date is correct) I was dispatched to Geneva for the
                    opening of the 18-nation disarmament conference under UN auspices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you covering it for the press, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I was to head the USIA coverage team, which I was putting together with
                    the cooperation of the European area. Incidentally, I also went as a
                    full-fledged official member of the US delegation—a first I was informed in the
                    history of US participation in international conferences. Robert Don Levine, our
                    PAO in Geneva, was very helpful in setting up the facilities for our coverage
                    team. As an official member of the delegation I participated in all the
                    delegation sessions and sat with the delegation in all the conference meetings.
                    From the beginning the Soviets relentlessly taunted us for our failure to table
                    our proposal for general and complete disarmament on the opening day of the
                    18-nation conference, as we had earlier committed ourselves to doing. Finally
                    John McNaughton who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for international affairs
                    brought over, after many delays, the official U.S. draft prepared for general
                    and complete disarmament.</p>
                <p>And I had the difficult task of reducing this intricate product of bureaucratic
                    negotiations to a comprehensible statement and format for the use of the
                    international press. So I got it broken down in three different ways to
                    facilitate the indispensable cross-referencing. And I must say, McNaughton was
                    very pleased. He couldn't believe that the whole—that whole voluminous and
                    complicated package—could have been reduced to all its essentials without
                    distorting any of the “nuances” as he said, and all written within the compass
                    of thirty pages.</p>
                <p>According to McNaughton, blood was spilt throughout the corridors of Washington
                    to get the monstrosity cleared. There had been terrible inter-agency and
                    intramural battles. And the sad truth was that it was really only a paper
                    exercise. Everybody knew that nothing would come of it because under no
                    circumstances would the U.S. agree to any kind of general discussion and
                    proposal. And all that bureaucratic wrangling and battling over the prose and so
                    on was really a tremendous waste of time. Again, an illuminating experience. And
                    I was only pleased that at least the material that was distributed to press
                    proved usable to a lot of the correspondents who were there.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>It was an interesting experience for me because I came back with certain feelings
                    about this whole process of negotiation with the Soviet Union. I thought we were
                    throwing up a lot of unnecessary roadblocks, for a whole variety of reasons,
                    many of which were not, I thought, sound. It was also clear to me that the
                    Soviets, certainly, would not negotiate anything serious in the nuclear world
                    unless they got over their obsession with secrecy. Little did I know about who
                    was obsessed with secrecy. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I returned to Washington and wrote a report for Tom Sorensen recording my views
                    and observations, what I thought we should do and what the USIA problem was. I
                    thought our most critical task in dealing with the USA-USSR confrontation was to
                    try to convince Soviet audiences that in an era of nuclear capability secrecy
                    was no longer the advantage that it had been in conventional warfare,
                    historically speaking. In fact, it would be a great detriment because it would
                    be the source of not only grievous, but disastrous miscalculations. It was the
                    sharing of knowledge that was the answer to the problem of defense in the
                    nuclear age. Well, I didn't get very far with any of this. [Laughter] Yet, after
                    all, that conference did lead eventually to the first test ban agreement.</p>
                <p>Several Of Moceri's Expressions Of Doubt Re Kennedy Administration
                    Policies—Notably The Alliance For Progress—Annoyed Sorensen Et Al, And Led To
                    Moceri's Assignment Elsewhere</p>
                <p>As I ought to have expected, there was no reaction at all to my report on my
                    involvement in, and conclusions concerning, the disarmament conference in
                    Geneva. So I now felt beyond a doubt that my days in IOP were numbered and I did
                    wonder how much longer my presence would be tolerated. Even outside the official
                    context of USIA I had picked up private signals that there was more than a
                    little annoyance over my reservations concerning a number of policy positions
                    and postures adopted by the Kennedy administration. A good example of these
                    reservations was my criticism of the rationale for the Alliance for Progress and
                    the obsession of the Kennedy-ites with the notion of promoting political change
                    through economic and social reform. No group in power, I had pointed out, gives
                    up power voluntarily. The solution to power is always a political solution. It's
                    never an economic or social solution. So I thought that the Administration
                    approached the whole problem from the wrong angle. And among the elements of the
                    situation that caught my attention was the observation that Latin
                    Americans—wealthy Latin Americans—were exporting more capital than we were
                    putting into South America at the time. In short, I was objecting to what I felt
                    was really public relations gimmickry, instead of substantive dealings with the
                    real issues of our political problems with Latin America.</p>
                <p>Another issue was the Castro business. I was convinced that we were making a
                    world figure out of Castro, who represented an area, a country, that was
                    probably despised by most Latin Americans anyhow. All we were doing was creating
                    the image of a strong leader that could stand up successfully to the United
                    States. We were wasting propaganda capital on this. We were wasting agency
                    resources. Later on, when I came back from Africa in 1967, I made that point to
                    Hew Ryan. I got nowhere at all with Hew.</p>

                <p>A Public Opinion Poll By Lloyd Free In 1960 Showing Wide Support For Castro Both
                    Rural And Urban Was Ignored By Top US Government Echelons Just Before Bay Of
                    Pigs Fiasco</p>
                <p>Once again let me backtrack chronologically, because this reference to the
                    exaggeration of the danger posed by Castro takes me back to the antecedents of
                    the Bay of Pigs episode. In October of 1960, I had seen a lengthy article in
                    Nation magazine on American military training of Cuban exiles at sites in
                    Guatemala. I wondered and worried about this—and indeed the accuracy of the
                    story—because I had seen nothing in the traffic crossing my desk and had heard
                    nothing in the course of the daily policy guidance meetings in the Agency over
                    which I had been presiding for several months. A month later I picked up in my
                    office mail a copy of a report that Lloyd Free, then a public affairs consultant
                    to Nelson Rockefeller, had prepared on a public opinion survey he had conducted
                    in Cuba during the previous summer, that is, the summer of 1960. Lloyd's
                    conclusion was that there was overwhelming support for Castro among both the
                    urban and rural populations of Cuba. Although I had long been skeptical of the
                    value of public opinion polling, I had considerable respect for Lloyd's
                    abilities and intelligence (despite my differences with him over the matter of
                    the Italian elections of 1953). I brought the report to Halsema's attention and
                    urged him to apprize the Agency's leadership of its implications. I doubt that
                    he did, and I heard nothing more about it. When the attempted invasion at the
                    Bay of Pigs occurred, I was as surprised as everybody else. I immediately
                    thought that anyone who had read Lloyd Free's report would not have undertaken
                    to carry out such a scatter-brained operation. Months later when I saw Lloyd, I
                    asked him about this. He ruefully told me that he had in the fall of 1960
                    distributed copies of his report all around the White House and in the foreign
                    affairs community, including CIA and the Defense Department. One more
                    illustration of the persistent inattention, indeed, indifference at the highest
                    levels of our government to the fundamental importance and implications of
                    climates of opinion in the arena of foreign affairs!</p>
                <p>Moceri Attends Puerto Rico Conference To Kick Off Peace Corps Program</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Shortly after my return from the disarmament conference in Geneva (May 1962) I
                    was instructed to report to the Peace Corps to serve as the public affairs
                    advisor for an international conference that Sargent Shriver wanted organized to
                    focus worldwide attention to the problems of middle-level manpower needs
                    throughout the underdeveloped countries of the world. A foreign service officer
                    from State and I did all the unglamorous work of organizing the preparations for
                    the conference. Shriver and his two principal assistants—advisors, if you
                    will—Richard Goodwin and Bill Haddad, handled the more glamorous task of
                    negotiations with the scores of foreign governments whose participation they
                    sought for the success or—as I soon became convinced—the prestige of the
                    conference. Early on, I concluded that the theme of the conference was important
                    but the only sensible venue for dealing with the problem was through our
                    bilateral dealings with the underdeveloped countries. The conference took place
                    that summer in Puerto Rico. It was only a modest success in the conventional
                    public relations terms that I thought really interested Shriver and his
                    associates. Certainly it attracted scant attention in the American media and
                    possibly even less in the foreign media.</p>
                <p>Despite the dim view I took of all these proceedings, the enormous vanity and
                    arrogance of our principals, I came to value the experience because it gave me
                    my one and only opportunity to meet Lyndon Johnson in the context of a working
                    situation. That experience was altogether different from all the conventional
                    wisdom and evidence concerning his impossible character, his phobias and his
                    obsessions. Before I left Washington for Puerto Rico I was exhaustively briefed
                    on his volcanic explosions, how he had to be handled, from what angles he had to
                    be photographed, what Scotch he preferred, and on and on. When he came down to
                    Puerto Rico to open the conference, I went to him and said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this? What was he doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, he was vice president at the time, right? Sargent Shriver had
                    cajoled 72 countries into sending representatives to this conference on
                    middle-level manpower needs of the Third World. And the vice president was asked
                    to make the opening speech at this conference, essentially to impress all these
                    dignitaries and high-level managers from foreign countries in attendance.</p>
                <p>The State Department didn't like the whole idea but had to go along. They felt,
                    “Well, Sargent Shriver's acting as if he's running a State Department of his
                    own.”</p>
                <p>I guess Lyndon Johnson had to be content with these kinds of symbolic appearances
                    and presentations. But I had heard from journalists in Puerto Rico who had come
                    to me all about problems they had had with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other tape ended when you said the journalists in
                        Puerto Rico had reported to you the problems they'd had with Lyndon
                        Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, on a previous visit to the island. So I went to the vice president
                    and told him about this in the plainest terms. I suggested it might be very
                    useful if he would meet with the press, allow photos to be taken, and to answer
                    questions, possibly even have a drink with the press. He showed himself
                    perfectly ready to do this. He wasn't at all disinclined. I didn't have any
                    problems at all arranging with him to do all this.I thought he was actually
                    quite gracious. People took pictures from various angles. And he answered all
                    questions. It all went very well. That was my one satisfaction and I was glad
                    for it because it gave me, at least, a personal insight into the man.</p>
                <p>I thought that the whole conference was no more than an occasion for Shriver,
                    Richard Goodwin and others just to have a world stage for themselves. That may
                    be too cynical but I didn't really see that this was a very effective means of
                    tackling the problem and hardly an effective expenditure of energy.</p>
                <p>On my return to Washington I learned that a decision had been made on a field
                    assignment for me. My two years were up in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd learned a lot of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assignment As PAO In Khartoum</p>
                <p>MOCERI: I had learned a lot of things. Evidently Tom Sorensen had decided in his
                    wisdom that I should fill the first available opening in the field, the PAO
                    position in the Sudan, replacing Henry Hudson. Especially after my briefings in
                    the Agency area office and at State I felt rather strongly that my work in my
                    earlier field assignments and my two years of Washington duty had earned me the
                    right to a more important assignment than the Sudan. I knew nothing about that
                    part of the world or the Arab world and Northeast Africa. It was unmistakably
                    clear from my briefings that Washington viewed the Sudan with complacency as a
                    quiet backwater country that was not expected to present any problems. All I
                    really got in terms of briefings and preparation was “You go out there and have
                    an easy, pleasant time of it.” This was a State Department officer, Cleo Noel,
                    if I recall correctly, that was his name. Many years later, he was an ambassador
                    in Khartoum and was killed by a terrorist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't recall his name.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MOCERI: He was in 1962 the desk officer for the Sudan. And he said, “We're
                    perfectly happy with that regime.” [It was a military regime.] “We're perfectly
                    happy. We have no problems. You'll have a nice, quiet time there. You won't have
                    to do a thing. You just put in a couple of years. It'll be nice.” It wasn't my
                    idea of what I ought to be doing at that stage of my life in the foreign
                    service. I didn't know anything about the Sudan.</p>
                <p>I got there in November of '62 and remained for two years as PAO. Ned Roberts was
                    the area director. In terms of guidance from the remote Washington vantage
                    point, everything was going fine. There were no problems. We had no problems
                    with the Sudanese Government.</p>
                <p>Well, I got there and found myself seized with a pretty full set of management
                    problems. The information officer was spending three-fourths of his day editing
                    the wireless file for a couple of Sudanese newspapers. [Laughter] It seemed to
                    me an unconscionable waste of time. You don't spend three-quarters of any day
                    editing the wireless file. That's not the most important thing in the world in
                    any set of circumstances. Sure, it shouldn't take all that time. The cultural
                    affairs officer, who was new to the Agency, enjoyed his assignment—in my opinion
                    because he had so little to do and relished the leisurely pace of foreign
                    service life.</p>
                <p>USIA Program In Sudan Was In Disastrous Condition</p>
                <p>I'd had the previous experience of Taipei and thought that was a disaster—a
                    situation that should never have been allowed to happen. Even if I were the most
                    brilliant man in the world, I still shouldn't have been put into that kind of a
                    situation. Because there are too many problems. One can say, “Oh, but you've got
                    all new people. You can mold them the way you want.” No, that's not the way to
                    do business, in my book. And there had been nothing that prepared me for USIS
                    Khartoum.</p>
                <p>I knew that I had a lot to learn about the Sudan and our USIS program before I
                    could venture to open my mouth about anything in the Ambassador's staff
                    meetings. The bemused, seemingly indulgent contempt with which senior Embassy
                    personnel looked upon USIS and its activities was quite transparent. The more I
                    learned about the USIS program, the more I marveled at the rationale for its
                    existence. The PAO residence, which I inherited, had fourteen air conditioners
                    used year-round in the desert heat of Khartoum. The cost was unbelievable. I
                    replaced them all and used two desert coolers, consuming about $30 worth of
                    electricity per month. I looked at our operations. The library was a fairly
                    shabby operation. The magazine that we distributed, the Arabic-language magazine
                    printed in Beirut left much to be desired in terms of program utility. Our
                    cultural exchange resources were almost laughably minuscule in comparison with
                    the joint activities of the Soviet Embassy and the Sudanese Communist Party in
                    sending young Sudanese on four-year study programs in the USSR (an activity on
                    which I reported rather extensively). An attentive analysis of the USIS country
                    budget showed that 94% of a quarter million dollar operation was tied up in
                    fixed costs. For the current fiscal year any new program initiative was
                    virtually impossible, thanks to insufficiency of funds.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>So I went about the business of trying to establish contacts with people, find
                    out what was making this country tick, and so on. Thanks to some of the local
                    staff, I met a number of people and most importantly some who had been senior
                    civil servants trained under the British.</p>
                <p>Well, one fact I learned that was especially interesting and indicative for me,
                    the Abboud military regime had gotten rid of over 65% of all the civil servants
                    trained by the British. One may say what he wants about British imperialism and
                    British colonial administration, but people they trained they generally trained
                    pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And these were good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They left a good basis for a logical government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And I thought, “Well, something will have to give in this situation.
                    These military people won't really know how to run a government. They get rid of
                    all their trained bureaucrats. And bureaucrats have a function, after all.”</p>
                <p>And I got in touch with university students. Got to know quite a few of them,
                    including a few university girls. And then southern students, the blacks of
                    southern Sudan. I was really fairly careful at this point, because I realized
                    that, like all authoritarian regimes, this regime could be quite restrictive and
                    very intolerant of certain things.</p>
                <p>Moceri Predicts Forthcoming Coup But Ambassador Ignores His Report</p>
                <p>So I moved rather carefully. I did quietly arrange for people to come out to my
                    house for dinner, music or just conversation. We talked of their problems, and I
                    learned much about their country. Within four months I came to the conclusion
                    that this regime's days were numbered. So I sat down and wrote a lengthy paper
                    on the coming coup d'�tat, the conditions that were its seed-bed and why it
                    would happen.</p>
                <p>By this time I'd become quite friendly with the CIA station chief, in part
                    because of the warm friendship between our wives. One day I said, “Look this
                    paper over because I want to give it to the ambassador. I think it's a good
                    reading of the situation, as I know it. And I want your reaction.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>He read it and he says, “You're right. You should give it to the ambassador.” And
                    I figured, well, the ambassador will send it in. The ambassador was William
                    Rountree. And I didn't know, before I went there, that Rountree had been
                    ambassador to Pakistan and had been removed at the insistence of Lyndon Johnson,
                    when Vice President Johnson on his swing through the South committed several
                    gaffe's—to the barely concealed delight of the accompanying American press
                    corps.</p>
                <p>Rountree had had a remarkable career in the Department and he was very able. But
                    at this point, I think he was gun-shy. He just wanted everything quiet, didn't
                    want to raise any hackles or call undue attentions to himself.</p>
                <p>The argument I advanced in the paper was along these lines: “The government has
                    alienated every segment of the public sector, apart from the Army, and that too
                    may be in question. There isn't an element in this country that supports this
                    regime anymore.” And I added, “Some incident will occur. Probably something like
                    a student being killed or something like that. It'll be just like a leaf falling
                    somewhere. The conflagration will take place. And this regime is finished.”</p>
                <p>Well, my guess is that Ambassador Rountree simply filed the report, buried it. At
                    the time I was still very much the newcomer, our relations were formally correct
                    but just that. Rountree was as always correct, very courteous, and generally
                    quite a reserved Southern gentleman. I hesitated to ask about my paper and he
                    never mentioned it. But word of my thesis did get around. You know, the wife of
                    one of the political officers in needling, “Oh, Moceri and his revolution.” And
                    I was pointedly reminded of this when the revolution took—coup d'�tat took
                    place. And it happened some 18 months later. The regime just disintegrated when
                    it was confronted by an angry but unarmed mob. Perhaps because it had no stomach
                    for a bloody massacre.</p>
                <p>Well, I felt this was simply a question of my objectively trying to read what the
                    climate, political climate, of opinion was. And that this was one of my proper
                    functions. And I felt that the political people weren't doing this. All I was
                    hearing were expressions of considerable satisfaction with the way things were
                    going, in spite of the growing unrest in the South in the spring of 1963.</p>
                <p>The ambassador came to me at that time and said, “Why aren't you doing more to
                    persuade the people, the Sudanese people, that we are giving our assistance to
                    them?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Because they don't believe it. And there's no way of making them believe
                    that. They see our assistance going to a government, which then diverts the
                    equivalent amount of resources for its own little war in the southern Sudan.”
                    The estimates in 1964 were that—when I left—were that already half a million
                    people had been killed in that civil war.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>There had been, I think, a total of a couple stories in the New York Times.
                    Hedrick Smith came up from Cairo to cover the unfolding crisis in the South. I
                    gave him a complete briefing on the southern problem, the problem of Arab-black
                    relations in the Sudan of the missionaries and so forth. [Laughter] He said,
                    “Don't give me so much detail. I can only file a 500-word dispatch a day. I
                    can't explain all this in 500 words.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's your problem.” But he was very good about it. I went at
                    considerable lengths to brief him.</p>
                <p>Eighteen Months After Moceri's Paper Prepared, The Coup Comes</p>
                <p>On our wedding anniversary—I'm sorry for introducing this personal note. There
                    always has to be some personal element in this. I was taking Modesta out to
                    dinner; one of the few times we went out to dinner in the Sudan. And there was a
                    restaurant a block away from the Embassy, up on the 14th floor of this new
                    building. I'd made an 8 o'clock dinner reservation, but I got home later than I
                    had expected. We hurried back to the center of Khartoum and drove to a round
                    circle from which we could go directly down a street to the restaurant and
                    Embassy. We were about five blocks from the Embassy, at the time. The street was
                    completely closed. There were tanks all around. Every car parked on that street,
                    as far as the restaurant and the Embassy was ablaze.</p>
                <p>Had I gotten there 15 minutes earlier, either we would have been in the car and
                    injured or killed, or the car would have been burned while we were having our
                    dinner. And we would have been stuck up there. In the meantime, all hell had
                    broken loose; gunfire, a seething mob, tanks maneuvering, troops getting into
                    position around government buildings. Dropping my wife off at a friend's house,
                    I picked up my information officer and circled the city for several hours,
                    gathering impressions and information.</p>
                <p>From that moment, the 22nd of October, all foreign missions lost all contact with
                    the Sudanese. Our CIA lost all its contacts with the army and the police. The
                    ambassador lost all his contacts. Things were so bad that the British ambassador
                    was calling our ambassador to find out what he knew. And our ambassador was
                    calling him. Nobody knew. Curfew was imposed. Yet I went out every night,
                    seeking information from my Sudanese contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the coup that you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: This was the coup that I had foreseen and it had started with a protest
                    staged by university students. Three university students had been killed, by the
                    military, because they were protesting certain government actions. There was
                    sporadic gunfire, and some shots came through Embassy windows. Our flag was
                    pulled down. Large angry crowds milled around our building all day.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But I thought and pointed out to my colleagues, “You know, it's all very
                    methodical. All you have to do is get here at 7:00 and the mobs arrive at 8:00.
                    Then they go off at 3:00. And then you go home. So there's no real danger.” But
                    with the curfew, nobody traveled. Yet I went out, for more than a week, every
                    night. And I'd run the barricades and the check points.</p>
                <p>I'd come in to the Embassy in the morning and report to the ambassador on what
                    I'd learned the night before from my contacts. Because I still had my contacts,
                    and I thought they were good. My best source was this one person, who said to
                    me, “I'm in hiding. I don't want to be part of the new government because I
                    don't approve. But here is what I'm learning.”</p>
                <p>So I'd brief the ambassador. He'd call in his secretary and dictate a telegram to
                    Washington. That was the one communication for the day with Washington. After a
                    week, he got pretty nervous about it. And he said, “You know, I don't want you
                    to risk your life just to take...”</p>
                <p>I said, “It's all right. If I don't go out you're not going to learn anything.
                    And I'm careful.” You know, as I drove down any street I'd make sure that I had
                    a place to turn around if I suddenly encountered something suspicious or
                    threatening.</p>
                <p>Well, that was over, and I soon left Khartoum, with the new government installed
                    and taking actions against our interests in the Congo. Six months later, I saw
                    Ambassador Rountree in Washington. He didn't remember that I had been there
                    during the coup. [Laughter] I was appalled.</p>
                <p>He had, incidentally, in early 1963 authorized only me to address any Sudanese
                    group on the question of the blacks in America. He wouldn't have anyone else
                    addressing the question about the blacks in America. The Embassy had been
                    invited to address a group of very prominent Sudanese on the problems of the
                    blacks in America. It was not an invitation the Embassy could refuse. The DCM
                    was designated to speak on behalf of the Embassy. And the Ambassador asked me to
                    draft a speech for the DCM.</p>
                <p>And I was honest in developing my account of the nature of the problem and the
                    prospect for the future. I talked about the problem of the blacks, the problem
                    of political power, the riots in American cities; you know, things were burning.
                    I said there would be a lot more burning until the blacks realize they have to
                    organize themselves politically. This is the way you got to power. You acquire
                    power in a democratic country through political organization. And I pulled no
                    punches.</p>
                <p>I knew what the problems of the northern Sudanese were, what troubled them. They
                    were afraid, because of their color, that we Americans would look on them as
                    blacks. Well, of course, most of them may well have had...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they did have black heritage...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: ...in their ancestry, because of the concubines, and so on, and the
                    abuse. In this respect, I had played a really useful role. I had a lot of people
                    out to the house for all kinds of briefings on these particular problems.</p>
                <p>My time came, and, as I say, I left.</p>
                <p>To go back to the summer of 1964, when tensions were building up, prior to the
                    coup d'�tat, and the war situation in the south was getting much worse. There
                    was a terrible missionary problem. And I think, maybe, Ambassador Rountree
                    realized the situation was possibly beginning to unravel. I had talked to him
                    about this problem.</p>
                <p>I'd said, “You know, I have a number of contacts. I know a number of southern
                    students. I know a number of northern university students. I know a number of
                    northern university girls, which is a particularly special audience for my wife
                    and me.” I never could reach them on any significant scale, because of the
                    problem of the Communist Party in the Sudan, which had a very effective campaign
                    going, recruiting university girls over the issue of circumcision. The Party was
                    making a lot of headway with that appeal.</p>
                <p>I also knew a number of university professors and, of course, the newspaper
                    people and so on. And I said, “Look, we have to know more about the attitudes of
                    any opposition and the opposing groups out there. But I know that the government
                    will probably become aware of my contacts or activities, and will probably learn
                    to keep an eye on me. But if you want, I'm willing to take the risk and meet as
                    many of these sectors as I can, cultivate them as assiduously as I can, provided
                    you know what I'm doing, and that the day the government declares me persona non
                    grata, you will know how to handle that situation and get rid of me without any
                    damage to my career.”</p>
                <p>In other words, in that kind of closed society you have to take certain risks. If
                    you have to establish contacts and can establish them, you should and must.
                    Otherwise, how are you going to know, with a controlled press, TV and radio,
                    what is really going on and what people are thinking?</p>
                <p>Well, he never really cottoned to the idea. He must have felt it would be too
                    risky. So that went by the wayside. Yet it is a question that we must constantly
                    consider.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I should add that, at the end of my first year, before the end of the fiscal
                    year—that was fiscal 1963—I turned back $56,000 to the Agency as unexpended
                    funds. I said, “You withdraw these funds because I can't spend them to good
                    program ends before the close of the fiscal year,” which was, I guess, a shock
                    in Washington. Certainly, a shock to Ned Roberts and his people. And I never
                    recovered the money or anything. The next year's budget came out and I had
                    $56,000 less. Well, I didn't believe in wasting money. And I thought, well, this
                    was another lesson to me about how money is used and misused in the Agency. So
                    much for that item.</p>
                <p>1965: Moceri Informed As He Is Leaving Khartoum That His Next Post Is To Be
                    Conakry, Guinea</p>
                <p>Before my departure from Sudan, Dan Oleksiw had informed me that my next
                    assignment would be Conakry. [Laughter] Well, at that point, I had to be told
                    where Conakry was. As a political officer, who eventually was transferred to
                    Conakry from Moscow, said, “This has got to be the end of the world.”</p>
                <p>I cannot imagine any reasonably seasoned officer, even if only a Class 2, being
                    delighted at the prospect of a tour in Guinea. If ever a listing of countries in
                    terms of priority ranking had been or were ever made up in the Agency, Guinea
                    would certainly have been very close to the bottom of the list. Ruefully I
                    reminded myself of what a personnel officer had said to me when she learned that
                    I had in fact ended up in Florence as my first assignment in the foreign
                    service, “Now that you have Florence, the crown jewel of the foreign service,
                    you'll spend the rest of your career paying for it.” I could not help thinking
                    that Fate or Destiny or whatever we mean by such words was exacting a rather
                    heavy price for a tour of duty that had been quite other than a ball. (In five
                    years of service I saw less of Florence as a city to enjoy than I did in a
                    week's sojourn as a Fulbrighter.) I did wonder whether the Conakry assignment
                    might be the last chapter in my exile.</p>
                <p>Once again I returned to Washington—this time for nearly six months thanks to
                    mandatory participation in a counter-insurgency seminar and French language
                    training. The seminar, which grew out of Walter Rostow's half-baked legalistic
                    theories on the role of counter-insurgency in global strategy and Robert
                    Kennedy's juvenile propensity for action at any cost, was in my opinion a great
                    waste of time. Nothing in the six-week duration of the seminar persuaded me of
                    its relevance to the mission of USIA. I could not help noticing that Frank
                    Carlucci, a member of my group in the seminar, an officer returning as a hero
                    from the Congo and destined for the highest positions in our government,
                    attended the opening day of the seminar and was not seen again until the last
                    day.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I soon discovered that nobody in Washington seemed to think that a thorough
                    briefing on Guinea in the context of US policy interests or of the commitment of
                    USIA resources was important. Trying to find out anything about Conakry, from
                    anyone in Washington, was really a hopeless task. Reflecting later on my
                    Khartoum and Conakry experiences, I have found myself wondering with some
                    amazement how Washington could send anyone out to a post with so little—if
                    any—briefing on problems and the political significance of the country in terms
                    of the general context of US foreign policy and interests.</p>
                <p>Concerning the Sudan, I had been told essentially, “No problems. We're perfectly
                    happy.” Yet there were a host of problems, about which we needed to be quite
                    candid with the Sudanese and, perhaps more importantly, ourselves. All our
                    feeble efforts to strengthen Sudanese orientation to the West over the past
                    thirty years and at a cost of millions upon millions have proven, beyond any
                    possible doubt, totally ineffectual. The Sudanese Arabs, as I often pointed out,
                    had constantly to prove to themselves and the Arab world that they were Arabic
                    to the core, 110%, Arabs ne plus ultra. And all this fed by a relentless
                    undercurrent of Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
                <p>In the case of Guinea, all I could ascertain was that Guinea was important to our
                    strategic interests because of its immensely rich, high-grade bauxite deposits,
                    which had to be denied to the Soviets. My years in Conakry taught me the
                    absurdity of this contention. Suffice it to say that, when the Guinean
                    government was figuratively hammering the American Embassy and actually placing
                    the American ambassador under house arrest, it was engaging in strenuous and
                    successful negotiations with representatives of an American capitalist
                    consortium for contractual arrangements for the exploitation of its bauxite
                    deposits.</p>
                <p>Finally, I arrived in Conakry (July 1965) and, to my astonishment, was met at
                    plane side by Ambassador Loeb. Such was my curious introduction to a strange and
                    occasionally extra- ordinary “Alice in Wonderland” tour. Loeb, publisher of a
                    newspaper in upstate New York, good friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, prominent
                    member of ADA, had first been appointed ambassador to Peru by the Kennedy
                    Administration. When a military coup took place in Lima and he publicly
                    criticized its leaders, he had to be removed. His loyalty to one aspect of the
                    new posture the Kennedy Administration wanted to promote in its relations with
                    Latin America was rewarded with an appointment as ambassador to Guinea. There
                    had been every expectation that, given his considerable liberal reputation, he
                    would get along famously with Sekou Tour�, the President of Guinea.</p>
                <p>My very first experience in Guinea was another case of presumption or, more
                    charitably, miscalculation on the part of American officialdom. A private Ohio
                    outfit had wanted to sell, or get rid of, two old DC-3s. They'd been trying to
                    peddle them everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa without success. The company
                    finally enlisted the support of the Kennedy Administration. With that official
                    helping hand they'd finally found an African country which would buckle
                    under...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who wanted to start an Air Force. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Not quite. The Guinean government really wanted a civil aviation
                    capability. So it purchased these two DC-3s with the blessing and backing of the
                    USG. The planes had been fixed up and cleared by the FAA. The ambassador was
                    just delighted. These planes had just arrived only a few days before I did. The
                    Ambassador was invited—with some of his staff—to take the first ride in one of
                    these planes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was piloting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I don't remember his name, but I think it was an American piloting the
                    plane. I'll never forget the experience. He asked me to go along. I was new and
                    would get a view of the countryside, and all that. I was reminded that we
                    weren't going to see anything of the countryside after that flight because
                    Americans, except for the Peace Corps, were restricted to the city limits of
                    Conakry. The morning after the flight, the ambassador called me on the phone and
                    said, in high humor, “I want you to feel lucky you're alive.” A strong thing,
                    coming from the ambassador. “Well, the crew checked over the plane after we
                    landed back at Conakry. And they found huge cracks in the landing gear.” That
                    became my introduction to the never-never world of Conakry.</p>
                <p>Another side of that particular equation was that the ambassador seriously had
                    entertained illusions of being a de facto financial advisor to President Tour�,
                    indeed was hopeful that an official announcement to that effect would soon be
                    made. Loeb certainly did not know or understand his man. Tour� had come up
                    through the labor unions and the French Confederation of Labor. He had mastered
                    all the communist techniques, had organized his party, had come up on top. He
                    had stood up to Charles de Gaulle and been the only West African leader to say,
                    “no” to de Gaulle's proposal for the union of the West African states and
                    continued association with France. In retaliation, he had been left without any
                    technicians to run the country; and all equipment had been rendered, at least
                    temporarily, inoperable.</p>
                <p>Well, on the fact of it, it was absurd to think that our ambassador could become
                    the financial advisor to Tour�. Tour� had begun a correspondence with Kennedy.
                    You know, “Dear John,” and “Dear Sekou,” and back and forth. [Laughter] And so,
                    Tour� thought that, to use a strictly American expression, he was a “soul
                    brother” to John Kennedy. But that didn't mean he was going to take any
                    instruction from a lowly foreign ambassador.</p>
                <p>Well, he left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MOCERI: The ambassador left, about two months after my own arrival. And there was
                    no replacement for more than a year. The DCM, Pierre Graham, became the charg�
                    d'affaires. Some weeks later he turned to me and said, “You know, you have a
                    real feel for these people. You get along. And you understand the situation.”
                    This on the basis of many conversations we had had. I was still trying to find
                    out what the devil our US interest was in Guinea. Pierre Graham had fallen into
                    the practice, or habit, of taking me along to his weekly meetings with Sekou
                    Tour�, initially as his note-taker. He evidently was impressed by the rapport
                    that was developing between Tour� and me. So he asked me to be his, sort of, de
                    facto head of the political section. From that moment until the arrival of
                    Charles Whitehouse as DCM a year later, I functioned as our unnamed DCM in all
                    matters except administration. I initiated and drafted all political reporting.
                    I prepared a lengthy account and analysis of Governor Williams' extensive
                    meeting with Tour� and the Embassy's annual assessment report.</p>
                <p>1963 Visit Of Governor Mennen Williams To Conakry</p>
                <p>In October of '63, Governor Williams, who was Assistant Secretary of State for
                    African Affairs, came out.</p>
                <p>So a large scale meeting was arranged with Tour�. To eliminate any distractions,
                    Tour� arranged to have this full-scale exercise of Guinean-American relations at
                    an isolated resort in the hilly hinterland of Guinea. Pierre Graham, the charg�
                    d'affaires, asked me to be the note-taker for these sessions. And we spent all
                    day at this resort in round-table discussion with Sekou Tour�, his staff and key
                    members of the party Politburo.</p>
                <p>And I found myself wondering why Governor Williams was pressing so hard for
                    freedom of education above all the freedom for private schools, and so on. This,
                    I could only guess, was to liberalize a regime that wasn't about to be
                    liberalized. [Laughter] It was really a waste of time.</p>
                <p>Sekou Tour� was masterful in delineating his own situation and his view of
                    African politics. He went into the subject of colonialism in great depth.
                    Publicly, he always talked about the imperialists: but privately, in talking to
                    people like myself, he spoke most perceptively about the Africans and their
                    problems. It was their tribal weaknesses that had opened the doors to the
                    Europeans. They were responsible for their own downfall, is what he was
                    saying.</p>
                <p>But now that African leaders had taken over these colonies and their
                    administrative structures, they were going to defend them.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>When Governor Williams lectured him at some length about the extraordinary
                    achievements in economic progress that the Nigerians had brought about through
                    private initiatives, Sekou Tour� warned him that Nigeria was on the verge of a
                    terrible explosion and might well be torn apart by tribal rivalries and hatreds.
                    I had to surmise that Governor Williams was not impressed by Tour�'s forecast.
                    Quite evidently, the Biafran crisis and ensuing civil war did not take Tour� by
                    surprise.</p>
                <p>Sekou Tour�'s Vision For His Country Clashed With The Ideas Of Capitalism And
                    Market Economy That US Government Was Trying To Pressure Him To Accept</p>
                <p>Sekou Tour�'s argument was “We have a state and we have to build a nation of
                    people,” which made a great deal of sense. I thought that, in many respects, he
                    was eminently reasonable and clear sighted. And I got along quite well with him.
                    Pierre Graham and I used to call, regularly, once a week on him. Or he'd drop by
                    Pierre Graham's residence and we'd sit at the pool and talk. We had, I thought,
                    an excellent relationship that could yield us some advantage if we kept our
                    sights on reality rather than ideology.</p>
                <p>At one point, the situation got pretty tense, though, because the negotiations
                    with the American companies were going fairly well, but negotiations with the
                    United States were not going particularly well, for a variety of reasons,
                    because we were promoting a very aggressive AID program, and insisting on a
                    broad panoply of tight controls and reporting requirements. AID was inundating
                    this country, which had really no bureaucracy worth the name, with demands for
                    all kinds of reports and accounting procedures they were clearly incapable of
                    handling.</p>
                <p>And then we pressed for proposals that Tour� didn't like at all, such as creating
                    a special category of rice growers, who would have certain privileges because we
                    would help them directly to increase their rice production. He saw this proposal
                    as a means of promoting the growth of a new capitalist class, which he wasn't
                    about to have; under no circumstances would he have it.</p>
                <p>Well, I took what people in the State Department called a romantic view of Tour�.
                    I didn't think it was. I thought it was far more objective and realistic than
                    the conventional wisdom in the Department or the media. I felt that he could be
                    reasoned with, if you looked at his particular kinds of problems and at things
                    going on in the country.</p>
                <p>Now you must remember, in Conakry, we were all confined to the city of Conakry;
                    we could not go out into the country. He wouldn't permit that except for the
                    Peace Corps people. And he had a lot of problems with the Peace Corps.
                    Eventually, he insisted on their being removed.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>In terms of USIS activities, there was really not very much that could be done. I
                    had a three-man staff: a cultural affairs officer, information officer, and a
                    public affairs trainee. We had a little library. I tried to promote the Horizons
                    book program. And we got some placement, but I had no illusions because I knew
                    that it was difficult to control. We talked to people about titles for the
                    program, and got the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Information to go
                    along with several of our suggestions.</p>
                <p>Chinese Very Active And Offered Programs Much More Attractive To Guinea</p>
                <p>But, you know, the Chinese—this is one area where the Chinese were very active
                    and, I thought, were very good in their approach to people. They could offer
                    Guinean officials and party cadres a lot more than I could ever offer. I had, at
                    best, three exchange grants or something like that. The Chinese played to a
                    fair-thee-well the parallelism with their own country and exploited the Vietnam
                    angle to the hilt. They concentrated on the Ministry of Information people. That
                    meant all the film people and the staff of the one newspaper, the party
                    newspaper.</p>
                <p>I thought they were better than the Russians at this game. They put up the
                    capital for the stadium and they actually built the stadium with their own hand
                    labor. They were very good at that.</p>
                <p>U.S. activities were very limited. There was no possibility of going up country
                    or going anywhere, outside of Conakry. Everything required government
                    permission. They were all suspicious, except for Tour� himself, who was
                    confident in his own power. But the underlings were hostile; at best, agreeable
                    in some respects and, in a few instances, we could get few things done.</p>
                <p>But my task at this point was really doing the political reporting for the
                    embassy. And all through that period, every political airgram, cable or
                    communication that went to the State Department was something that I drafted and
                    worked on.</p>
                <p>By the spring of 1966, our relationships had seriously deteriorated. The rapport
                    between our people in charge of our economic assistance programs and their
                    counterparts had reached almost a breaking point. The already bad internal
                    economy was getting worse. Tour�'s rivals and enemies in West Africa were
                    mounting a drumbeat of attacks on Tour� in their controlled press. Guinean
                    paranoia was clearly reaching a point only just short of explosion. At this
                    juncture Pierre Graham was called back to Washington for consultation in the
                    Department. Prior to his departure, there had been in a country team meeting
                    unanimous agreement that I should assume in Pierre's absence the position and
                    authority of an acting charg� d'affaires (I no longer remember whether or not a
                    message to that effect was sent to the State Department, but sending such a
                    message would have been standard procedure).</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Within a few days of Graham's departure the Guinean situation had visibly
                    deteriorated to a very disturbing degree. The air seemed electric with nervous
                    tension. Tour� decided to hold an enormous rally and delivered his famous—many
                    Westerners said, his infamous—speech summed up in the phrase “egorger les
                    imperialistes”. If he or members of the Bureau Politique were attacked and
                    assassinated at any time, now or in the future, he instructed all Guineans to
                    take upon themselves the initiative to hunt down and cut the throats of all the
                    imperialists residing in Guinea. He added that it was not necessary for him to
                    tell his Guinean brothers who were the imperialists: they already knew who they
                    were. Shock waves of alarm swept through the small community of westerners.
                    European expatriates spent hours conjuring up images of bloody massacres that
                    had taken place in the Congo. I refused to be misled by Tour�'s violent rhetoric
                    and insisted on maintaining complete calm and communication, directly and
                    indirectly, to all the American community my absolute certainty that disaster
                    was not around the corner. In the next two days the Western ambassadors and
                    senior diplomats came individually to see me, expressing their alarm and asking
                    for my personal assessment and assurances about the US Government's position. I
                    explained to each the reasons for my calm and confidence and reassured them that
                    Washington shared my assessment. In offering that last reassurance, I was using
                    a certain liberty and had to employ every device to hold the sense of panic in
                    check.</p>
                <p>Even the Soviet mission arranged to convey its concerns to me and sought my
                    estimate of the situation. Our shared skin color gave them real worries.</p>
                <p>The confidence I honestly held was warranted by the facts and my sense of Guinean
                    realities but with one caveat. I had no knowledge or even intimations of what
                    French intelligence and West African regimes hostile to Tour� might be planning.
                    Knowing full well the grudge in certain French quarters against Tour�, I had no
                    doubt that French intelligence was quite capable of organizing through other
                    channels a neat and swift little surgical strike against Tour�. Lacking any
                    intelligence sources, I could not know or even guess whether the will to strike
                    was there. I drafted a lengthy cable to Washington, detailing the reasons for my
                    assessment and my confidence that American lives were not in danger. I also
                    conveyed my concern about the hypothetical possibility of a foreign undercover
                    strike operation, in which case I could not guarantee the safety of Americans in
                    Guinea. Therefore I requested the Department to inform me whether the American
                    intelligence community had any information to indicate that the possibility was
                    more than hypothetical. After discussing my draft with my three most senior
                    associates, I sent off the cable.</p>
                <p>On his return an agitated Pierre Graham told me that the phrase “danger to
                    American lives” set off alarms all over the State Department. At his morning
                    staff meeting an irritated Secretary Rusk asked who was this person who had sent
                    in the cable. I was chagrined to realize that nobody had carefully read my cable
                    or understood what I was requesting. So ended a brief, inglorious tenure as an
                    acting charg�.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Not long after this episode one Assistant Director for the African area, Mark
                    Lewis, came out and told me that Frank Shakespeare was furious because I hadn't
                    submitted my monthly activity reports. I became very indignant about this,
                    furious to be honest, because I had been working interminable days and generally
                    late into the night, analyzing, rewriting, reporting and doing all the essential
                    functions of a mission that nobody else was prepared or willing to do. And I was
                    doing what I could in USIA, which was not very much.</p>
                <p>I went to the charg�, Pierre Graham, and to the AID director. And I said, “Look,
                    I've been raked over the coals by my area director. I'm charged with neglecting
                    my USIS program. I feel that I have been doing all the serious work of political
                    reporting. I've been doing what I have been asked by both of you and the
                    so-called country team to do. Now I am being reprimanded and insulted. Either
                    you straighten our Mark Lewis or I'm quitting the Agency. Because I just can't
                    work under these conditions. If I don't have the confidence of people back in
                    Washington in what I'm doing, that I'm making sensible use of my time; and if
                    they don't see all the political reporting, copies of which are on their desks,
                    and they have no idea that I'm doing it, then something is seriously wrong.”</p>
                <p>Well, they called Mark in and talked to him, made the point that I was an
                    invaluable member of the country team and I'd been doing this important work.
                    Mark withdrew his charge and said he'd go back and straighten it out, but I
                    don't know that it did me any good, anyhow. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect he probably said, “That isn't what you're
                        supposed to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: You know, this was a case where USIA ought to have recognized that, at
                    best, we had a minuscule USIS operation that, in itself, could not mean very
                    much in this kind of context.</p>
                <p>By early fall of 1966, an American Ambassador was in place. The Department had
                    finally appointed Robert McIlvaine. I wrote his statement for his presentation
                    ceremony to Tour�. And everything seemed to go very well for the first couple
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>Sekou Tour� felt that because of the remarks Ambassador McIlvaine had made, he
                    had found a kindred spirit in McIlvaine, and everything would go well. Here was
                    an ambassador who really understood him, etc.</p>
                <p>During Stop Of Pan Am Flight At Abidjan, Guinean Foreign Minister Removed From
                    Plane And Detained By Ivory Coast Military. Tour� Retaliates: Arrests U.S.
                    Ambassador. Widespread Repercussions</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, the Guinean foreign minister had to go to an
                    all-Africa conference in Addis Ababa, and decided to fly the most convenient
                    way—a Pan Am flight stopping over in Conakry, and going on to Addis. Apparently
                    the Guineans hadn't checked as to what stops the plane made in between. The
                    plane put down in the Ivory Coast at Abidjan. And he [the foreign minister] was
                    taken off the plane...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was taken off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: ...by the Ivoirian military, and put under house arrest in a military
                    camp. Well, the next morning, our ambassador in Conakry is placed under house
                    arrest. And Sekou Tour�, and everyone else around him is in a rage. During the
                    night, VOA had carried the story about the forcible removal of the Guinean
                    ambassador from the plane in Abidjan, and his detention in a military camp.
                    That's how Sekou Tour� learned about it, from VOA. In his mind, you see, the VOA
                    knew everything that was going on in Africa.</p>
                <p>We hadn't gotten the message. And, obviously, I hadn't stayed up all night just
                    to try to listen to a VOA broadcast, nor had Washington sent any word to us.
                    Well, I got this call from our administrative officer: “Look, our ambassador's
                    under house arrest. You better get down to the foreign ministry and see what can
                    be done about this.” So I raced down—not being under house arrest—saw the people
                    I knew, and they told me what the situation was. In response to my
                    protestations, they assured me they would go to Tour� on the matter.</p>
                <p>Well, we later learned that there had been some kind of communication foul-up
                    from the State Department, and the message had never gotten to our embassy. So
                    we were not alerted as to what happened. Well, the Guineans found this pretty
                    hard to believe.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the order placing McIlvaine under house arrest was lifted. I think
                    it was the next day. But by that time, Sekou Tour� had decided that the only way
                    he could get his foreign minister released was by bringing pressure on the
                    United States and adducing, as the reason, that Pan Am was U.S. property,
                    property of the U.S. Government, and therefore, the U.S. Government, which knows
                    everything that goes on in Africa, could work this deal.</p>
                <p>Well, apart from misconceptions about what is government ownership and what
                    isn't, Sekou Tour� was right. There was no way he was going to get his foreign
                    minister back unless the United States brought pressure on Abidjan to release
                    him, which is what happened. And, eventually, he was released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he picked up for in the first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The two countries, Guinea and the Ivory Coast, had not gotten along
                    in...</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know they didn't get along, but any particular...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: No, no particular reason. Apparently Houphouet-Boigny decided he'd get
                    hold of one of these guys and put pressure on Sekou Tour� and so on.</p>
                <p>Well, then there were waves of anti-imperialism—anti-Western imperialism protests
                    whipped up and so on. So, it was a very, very disagreeable period. This was the
                    time when I first learned about facing popular militia in many parts of the
                    world—kids with guns and trigger happy. The potential for disaster was all over
                    the place.</p>
                <p>The Frightening Incident At The Stadium</p>
                <p>At any rate, finally, the foreign minister, Beavogui, is released. And our
                    ambassador returns. And there's a great celebration organized to welcome back
                    the foreign minister in the stadium. And all the troops, all the members of the
                    party, are called. And the place is jam-packed. It was originally intended as a
                    soccer stadium, you see. So it had quite a capacity, perhaps as many as 25,000
                    people.</p>
                <p>We had discussed in our country team meeting how we were going to handle this.
                    Obviously, you know, we had to appear. It was a formal occasion, and there
                    simply had to be an American presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The American ambassador was there too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. Everybody was there. Charles Whitehouse had replaced Graham in the
                    late summer. So I argued that the ambassador, who had been humiliated by house
                    arrest, should not appear. I felt that Whitehouse should not appear, in part
                    because he was at that point hardly known to Tour�, in part because he was the
                    DCM. I felt that money bags, the AID administrator, should not be there.</p>
                <p>I said, “I think I'm the only one who should go. I'm not the personal
                    representative of the President of the United States. I don't represent the
                    money. They know me. Sekou Tour� has dealt with me. He knows me. He knows what
                    my place is. Beavogui, the foreign minister, knows who I am.” The Guinean
                    Ambassador to Washington, who had come back, knew me, and apparently had told
                    his superiors that I was one of the best friends Guinea had in the American
                    Embassy. On an earlier occasion I suspected he had read or been told about one
                    or another of my reports to the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Guinean Ambassador to Washington had returned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The Guinean ambassador. So I said, “This is the only sensible way. For me
                    to go. We've got to be represented.” So I took the very junior political officer
                    with me, a fellow named Robert Houdek, who today is charg� at our embassy in
                    Ethiopia. I like to feel that he did learn a few political lessons from me. We
                    had a very good relationship. Because I felt there should be at least two people
                    there. And I told him, “The first time anybody uses the term 'American
                    imperialism' or 'American imperialists,' I have to walk out. If I get up, you
                    get up immediately with me and walk just behind me.”</p>
                <p>We arrived at the stadium in the Ambassador's car and flying the American flag.
                    Both troops and the malice populaire were all over the place, at the entrances
                    to the grounds, lining the drives and at the entrances to the stadium itself.
                    Crowds were milling around on the grounds and the surrounding streets, because
                    the stadium itself was filled to capacity. We had no problem entering the
                    stadium area and getting to our seats in the section reserved for diplomats
                    directly under the President's tribune.</p>
                <p>For a while it all seemed a blur of speech-making, chanting and prolonged bursts
                    of applause. This was an audience of certainly more than 20,000 who were there
                    because they knew they were expected to provide the proceedings the atmospherics
                    of sustained din.</p>
                <p>Beavogui rose to his feet to deliver his speech. As he approached the rostrum and
                    microphones, he was given a thunderous welcome of shouts accompanied by waves of
                    applause.</p>
                <p>Then he launched into an impassioned denunciation of the American imperialists.
                    And the moment he said “The imperialists from the United States of America” I
                    stood up.</p>
                <p>I turned to Bob Houdek and said, “We're leaving.” Just as I started to walk out,
                    the foreign minister paused, pointed directly to me, and shouted into the
                    microphone, “The American imperialists.” Instantly the whole place broke into a
                    scream of rage; a great roar welled up from all the assembled host, echoed by
                    the crowds that had not been able to get into the stadium. I didn't care about
                    inside. I did, for one moment, feel concern about the throng outside. But I
                    thought to myself, “Well, somehow we'll get to the car and we'll get away.”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>The moment I started down the steps to the stair well, Sekou Tour�, I was told
                    later by the Italian Ambassador, leaned over and talked to his aide. His aide
                    scurried out. I was told he went down to alert the president's personal
                    bodyguards to make sure that I got out and got out safely. By then the whole
                    place was lined with these milice populaire. The president's bodyguards had to
                    drive them out of the way; literally ordered them to get out of the way and let
                    the car by. For a brief moment it appeared that the milice populaire would not
                    give ground. Well, they finally got out of the way. But Bob Houdek said, “it was
                    a scary experience.” But that passed, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might have been the first martyr in Guinea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Could well have been. [Laughter] It was possible. But you know how it is
                    in these situations. You do what you feel you have to do. And I thought if
                    something had to happen, it was better to happen with me involved than with the
                    ambassador, or with, say, the AID director.</p>
                <p>The tantrum that lay at the center of this event was not without serious
                    consequences that left nerves jangled and an unrelieved state of tension that
                    crackled like electricity. The Ambassador's premises were invaded by a small
                    crowd. The Peace Corps was expelled. (I believe I am correct in saying that this
                    was the first time the Peace Corps was expelled from any country.) More than
                    twenty people in the mission complex were declared personae non grata. The team
                    of Pan Am people who had been assisting Guinea in the development of plans for a
                    civil aviation capability was ordered to leave the country. As soon as these
                    obviously retaliatory measures were ordered and completed, Guinean-American
                    relations entered a period of uneasy, ever wary peace.</p>
                <p>In the meantime our Ambassador had been recalled to Washington for consultation,
                    as a signal to the Guinean government of our dissatisfaction with its actions.
                    For the benefit of Charles Whitehouse, our DCM and now charg�, I prepared a
                    lengthy memorandum to explain the breakdown in Guinean-American relationships,
                    my thesis concerning the political factors at work within Tour�'s party that had
                    probably forced his hand, and the role that I suspected the Chinese to have
                    played in the entire affair. But I also felt this was not enough; I was
                    convinced we had to develop a response that would forcefully drive home the
                    point that Guinea could not abuse the American interest and American
                    representative with impunity.</p>
                <p>Moceri's Proposed Plan For Embassy Operation In Wake Of Stadium Tirade But
                    Ambassador Rejects It</p>
                <p>I said to Whitehouse, “Look, we've got to work out a plan. Because we can't let
                    the Guineans get away with this. We've been humiliated and we have to show that,
                    as a great power, we do not accept humiliations. And the way to do this is,
                    step-by-step, to scale down the entire mission.”</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>“The Peace Corps director is gone. But we must also remove all the high-ranking
                    people and heads of agencies around the ambassador. Abolish my position and send
                    me out. Then the next person to go should be the AID director, then the head of
                    the political section, and on down until we leave the ambassador with a staff of
                    five people, simply to represent the United States; pure representation. We're
                    here if you want to talk to us. You can talk to us. We're willing to talk to
                    you. But that's all. no aid, no programs, nothing.”</p>
                <p>Well, he thought it was a good idea. I was convinced this was the only way of
                    responding to those in Tour�'s party who had been influenced by the Chinese, and
                    to Tour� personally. Tour� would get the message that we were highly displeased
                    and that the initiative, then, for repairing the relations, rested with him and
                    his party. This was what I was after. Because I felt no USIS program made sense
                    anymore in this situation, I eliminated my position—no doubt much to the
                    surprise of our African area office. And I left Conakry.</p>
                <p>No one else left because the ambassador, who had at this point returned, would
                    not agree to the implementation of my entire plan. You know, “You cut down this
                    far then why have an ambassador?” was his reasoning.</p>
                <p>So I went back to Washington and was sent out interviewing candidates for
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Suggesting that their first post might be a trainee in
                        Guinea? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, then Guinean Ambassador to Washington talked to people in the State
                    Department, asked that I be sent back to negotiate a new cultural agreement with
                    the foreign minister. Mark Lewis came to me, informed me of this proposal and
                    seemed to have assumed that I would be agreeable.</p>
                <p>I said, “No, you can't do this. This is absolutely wrong. It's not right. Because
                    then it weakens the case that I've been trying to make, you know, on behalf of
                    the United States. We're not seeking to make amends. Come on. Send someone else.
                    If you really believe that they will, in all earnestness, negotiate a new
                    cultural agreement with us, send somebody else. Don't send me. Precisely because
                    they've asked for me.” So that ended my connections with Conakry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did they ever send anybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>June, 1967: To The Murrow Center At Fletcher</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MOCERI: I don't think so, no. I don't think so. And well, things that happened
                    after that. So, in the meantime, here I was, you know, going around interviewing
                    candidates. Then I got a call from Henry Loomis' office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, 1967, possibly June of that year. And I was asked—Henry said, “We
                    need someone up in the Murrow Center at the Fletcher School of Law and
                    Diplomacy. Ambassador Gullion, who is the dean, is anxious to get someone to
                    replace Arthur Hoffman.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Sure, I'll go.” This was June of '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you this, now. What was Henry's position then?
                        Because he didn't become deputy director until the election of Nixon, and
                        that was in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Then I'm mistaken. He was at VOA. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still at VOA. After VOA, in 1965, Henry left the
                        Agency for a while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: That's right. He was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was over at the Office of Education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: That's it. Who was it who called me? Now I've forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1967, it couldn't have been Henry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, at any rate, I hadn't had my home leave yet, so I came for home
                    leave, out here in Auburn, Washington. And I got this call that I was being
                    designated to go to the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. And I remember I
                    bought that car I had, that Chrysler. I still have it. And we drove across the
                    country and landed in Medford, Massachusetts. Met with Gullion. And it happened
                    that there was an affair, shortly after, for the opening of the academic year.
                    And Tom Sorensen was up there. And Gullion hadn't heard of me, so Gullion asked
                    him—Tom told me this later—what he thought of this new fellow he was getting,
                    his Murrow fellow. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>And Tom told him, “You're getting one of the best officers in the Agency.
                    [Laughter] Whether Tom meant it or not, I don't know. But at any rate, it was
                    very nice of him. So I got off on the right footing. That was enough for
                    Gullion. So I spent two years there, which, in itself, was an interesting
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>In addition to teaching the graduate course on propaganda and a seminar on
                    problems of public diplomacy, I undertook a number of separate projects.</p>
                <p>First I wrote a paper and made a presentation to the Ford Foundation for research
                    funds for case studies in public diplomacy. And got $156,000 from the Ford
                    Foundation for that. Got it after much negotiation. The funds were released to
                    the Murrow Center after my departure in 1969, and I thought badly used; the
                    wrong kind of case studies and the wrong kind of people doing them. It could
                    have been very valuable.</p>
                <p>Gullion had an idea about the relationship of civilization and foreign affairs.
                    It was a very vague idea. I think he just liked the combination of words. And he
                    wanted me to write a paper on the subject.</p>
                <p>Well, what I was interested in at this point was the problem of analyzing, with
                    some accuracy, the patterns of behavior of a foreign society. All that you
                    couldn't do in terms of the conventional political reporting. What was required
                    was a different order of studies that would develop a sensitivity to an
                    understanding of the institutions of the country, the evolution of the
                    institutions, their practices, the modalities of the political process in the
                    country, in other words, and the effect of the culture of the country on the
                    thinking of the country; what parameters it established and so forth.</p>
                <p>I wrote a lengthy paper on this subject. And Gullion started peddling it around.
                    He claimed he fell asleep reading the paper and that's all right; that's my
                    prose. But the points were made and the Henry Luce Foundation gave $500,000 to
                    underwrite a professorial chair on the subject for a five-year period. It was to
                    be an area of special studies.</p>
                <p>In my paper I had illustrated the sort of things I thought needed careful
                    examination. I explained, however briefly, a number of situations in recent
                    history starting with the importance and implications of the European climate of
                    opinion prior to World War I. Drawing on my earlier studies of history and
                    political science, I touched on the miscalculations of diplomacy and the
                    political �lites, on the passion, the mystique of war; of a war as a purifier,
                    which was very much in the air in Europe at the end of the 19th century and the
                    beginning of the 20th. How this had influenced behavior and so on. Well, that
                    was only one of the many illustrations that I worked up in this paper.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Gullion submitted my paper as a proposal to the National Endowment for the
                    Humanities. And I forget at this moment who the head of that body was at the
                    time. He was a medieval history man —very good—who found the whole idea very
                    stimulating, from an academic point of view. And I said I felt that, for
                    Fletcher, it would be an important training for the political officers—eventual
                    political officers—because so many went through Fletcher and then ended up in
                    the Department as political officers. And I'd seen some of the inadequacies of
                    political officers of the day.</p>
                <p>The NEH people liked the idea. And so they pursued it with Fletcher School. In
                    the meantime, of course, I'd left. By the time they got into serious
                    negotiations, I was back in Washington, at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. So, finally, the case officer said, you know, “I'm going up and I'd
                    like you to come with me.” So the Agency let me go up. They were going to have a
                    two-day review. And coming back on the plane, he said, “Look, it's up to you.
                    I'm not convinced that the school has the capability to mount this kind of
                    program, to implement what you have in mind.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this? The case officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The case officer from the Endowment for the Humanities. Out of a sense of
                    loyalty I answered, “Well, yes, they do have the capabilities. And this is the
                    ideal place for this kind of program. Because so many people who go through the
                    Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy wind up in international affairs. And it's
                    these people who ought to be aware of the kinds of dimensions they are dealing
                    with, or in, other societies, and had been largely neglected by most people
                    involved in matters of foreign affairs.” I gave him my assurance that Fletcher
                    had the capability to carry out this kind of program, if they were properly
                    financed.</p>
                <p>NEH gave Fletcher $500,000 in seed money. And they had the Henry Luce Foundation
                    grant, for five years, of $500,000. The school had gotten about $1,155,000 out
                    of proposals based on papers that I had written. On working on these papers I
                    was always convinced that I was in a real sense making a contribution to the
                    Agency's area of concern—after all—very much so.</p>
                <p>When the Fletcher School received the NEH grant, Ed Gullion was in Washington on
                    other business. He came by to see me in IOR. He said, “You know, I'd ask you to
                    join our program, but you people in the Foreign Service, you're just too rich
                    for our blood.” Meaning I was making too much money for Fletcher. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too much? A Foreign Service officer? What the hell is he
                        talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, that's right. I was never invited even to give a lecture in that
                    program once it was set up. It's still going. But it is not at all the sort of
                    thing I had in mind.</p>
                <p>Well, backtracking a bit, at the end of the first year—see, now we're in
                    '68—Gullion asked the Agency if they'd leave me at the Murrow Center for another
                    year, because I was in the midst of these negotiations and I was carrying on the
                    Murrow Center and doing the lecturing and so on. The Agency agreed. So I stayed
                    the second year. And then in the spring of 1969, Gullion called Loomis and asked
                    him to let me stay at Fletcher a third year. Loomis said, “Oh no, Jim is too
                    valuable an officer. We need him here in Washington.”</p>
                <p>1969: Moceri Sent To Paris To Set Up Press Operation To Service European Media
                    During Moon Landing</p>
                <p>Well, the first think I heard was that I was to go to Paris for the Apollo 11
                    mission, because the Agency needed someone to set up a press operation in Paris
                    to service elements of the European media. I thought, “My God, you're sending
                    me? I'm a class two officer. I've had a fair amount of USIA experience. You can
                    send any junior officer to set up a press operation, if you think you need a
                    press operation in Paris for the European journalists. There are going to be
                    2,000 of them down at Canaveral for this event.”</p>
                <p>Well, it wasn't up to me to question, so off I went to Paris. Lee Brady was the
                    PAO, and he offered me the services of Collette Gaudin as my staff assistant in
                    their press center to be operated under the joint auspices of NASA and USIA.</p>
                <p>Even as we set up the operation I continued to think, “This is a Mickey Mouse
                    affair. You (meaning the Agency) send a class four officer and give him the
                    experience of working with the French. Fine. Okay.”</p>
                <p>Well, as you know, we tried to do the best we could there. I still thought it was
                    so much window-dressing for the benefit of inter-agency relations, but the
                    fellow from NASA, who was with me, thought it was a good operation. I had an
                    arrangement with the Hamelle Photo Laboratory so we could get almost immediate
                    reproductions of space pictures, excellent color reproduction, in any quantity
                    and for European distribution. Kodak used this same firm for their own work.
                    This arrangement was made possible through Collette Gaudin's contacts. And we
                    had excellent cooperation from the Hamelle people. We did have some measure of
                    activity with the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Maybe we provided some useful service, but I had my doubts about its importance.
                    After all, the scene of action was Canaveral and NASA headquarters. What people
                    did come in? The journalists that did come were those, I guess, that couldn't
                    get permission or backing to go to the United States. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Moceri's Idea Of Getting French Industry Involved In Jointly Funding NASA Space
                    Efforts Is Quashed In USIA</p>
                <p>At that time, because there was talk about the problems of NASA funding, there
                    was a solution: we make the space enterprise a North Atlantic joint enterprise.
                    Get the Europeans to come in and share in the development of the space program,
                    etc. And almost simultaneously, the Economist came out with the same sort of
                    idea.</p>
                <p>I asked Collette Gaudin if she could do something for me, because—I said, “I have
                    this idea and I'd like, before even mentioning it to Washington, to sound out
                    important people in French life, to see whether the French would really respond
                    to anything like this.” I added, “Here's the kind of people I want,” and
                    mentioned a string of industrial categories I would like to have covered in
                    arranging contacts.</p>
                <p>Because I thought, you know, there's no point in my trying to present something
                    like this to USIA and then eventually introduce it in government consultations
                    in Washington, if I come to the conclusion that the Europeans really aren't
                    interested in becoming partners in this kind of enterprise and sharing the
                    financial burdens, as well as potential benefits.</p>
                <p>Well, I must say, she did a superb job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this, doing this for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Collette Gaudin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: You may remember meeting her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I remember. She later died, unfortunately, of
                        cancer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: I knew that she'd had cancer. That was the last I knew. I didn't know
                    that she'd died.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She died about 19—oh, it was in the late 70s. I had
                        written her a letter. I hadn't heard from her for some time. And then I got
                        a letter back from Pierre, her husband. All it was, was one line, enclosed
                        by black border, announcing Collette's death.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Well, through my assistant, Collette Gaudin, a luncheon was arranged, at
                    one of the best restaurants in Paris, for about 20 people, all top-level
                    executives in some of the major industries, like the metallurgical industries,
                    the steel works of southern France, and people in the railroad administration.
                    And she had done a truly extraordinary job of getting all these people to
                    participate in what to be honest, was a meeting with a low-level Washington
                    functionary.</p>
                <p>So we had this elaborate French luncheon that I never tasted because I spent all
                    my time talking about this proposal, this idea of mine, and trying to get their
                    reactions to it. I thought my clinching argument was, “Look, would you rather
                    spend your $750,000,000 a year subsidizing certain West African countries, or
                    put it into a future like space, along with other partners of the North Atlantic
                    Treaty arrangements and the United States, under the conditions that you all
                    share, according, at least, to the financial contribution?”</p>
                <p>Well, there was not only interest and agreement. They were fascinated by the
                    possibility. I don't think they were merely being polite. I think they genuinely
                    saw this as a real possibility for the future, with certain potential that the
                    French might well be interested in.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington, after the whole thing was over, and thought I should
                    report to the head of IOP, William Weathersby. And I started to present this
                    idea of mine. I explained the background and how I talked to Frenchmen. I had a
                    list, then, of names and so on.</p>
                <p>And he just—I felt as if I had been blown out of the office. “Oh, come on. It's
                    the silliest idea ever. You could never get Congress to even think of agreeing
                    to anything like that. Because no matter what is said publicly, we want to keep
                    exclusive rights to any technology that's developed, etc., etc.” He gave all the
                    reasons why my idea was ridiculous.</p>
                <p>Fine, Okay. I forgot it. Let's forget it, then. I didn't pursue it. I didn't feel
                    I had any right to go beyond the head of IOP. Theoretically, I had been
                    operating under the umbrella of that office. So nothing, actually, ever came of
                    that.</p>
                <p>Meantime, well what am I doing here? It was disconcerting to be part of a
                    corridor brigade. Jim Halsema had written to me in Paris sounding me out on my
                    willingness to work with him in connection with an Arthur D. Little study. He
                    wanted me to join him, as his assistant and serve as liaison with the A.D.
                    Little team. So that was what I came back to. I thought it was a matter only of
                    a few weeks' work, or a month or two. It drifted on. You know the history of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I got all involved in that. I thought it was the
                        lousiest idea that we ever had. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: And obviously, there was a breakdown in communications on both sides. I
                    tried to serve as an effective liaison, which meant getting to the Arthur D.
                    Little people to understand what some of the Agency problems were. But, as you
                    know, nothing came of that. And there I was again, without an assignment.</p>
                <p>I made the rounds of the office. I went to people like Barbara White. I knew
                    there was a vacancy in IOP as her deputy. Apparently, she wasn't interested,
                    even though I'd helped her on more than one occasion in her career. I'd been
                    partly responsible for her getting her first field assignment as branch PAO in
                    Turin. Until that point she had occupied only staff positions in Rome. And she
                    had worked under me in IOP when I was Jim's deputy, Jim Halsema's deputy, back
                    in 1960-61.</p>
                <p>In Search Of An Assignment Moceri Sets Out Plan For An Analysis And Evaluation
                    Unit; Plan Accepted And Moceri Heads It</p>
                <p>So I kept spinning my wheels in search of an assignment. And I think Jim Halsema
                    came to me to report that Henry Loomis was interested in this suggestion that I
                    dreamed up for an analysis and evaluation unit. Would I spell it out? So I did.
                    I wrote a fairly long paper on the proposal. I didn't hear anything more for
                    quite a while.</p>
                <p>Then Jim informed me that Henry was talking to people, because Henry felt it
                    should not be in his office. It was something he wanted, but he didn't want it
                    in his office. He thought it might go in research or some other place. And he
                    wanted a class one officer to head it. I was a class two, so obviously, he
                    didn't even think about me. He apparently offered the position to a number of
                    class one officers, all of whom refused it because they thought it had no power
                    and would carry no authority.</p>
                <p>My idea was quite simple: whenever the deputy director—in this case, Henry
                    Loomis—had a problem that he wanted to look at and get an objective point of
                    view, he'd turn to this unit and say, “Look into this for me and give me your
                    report.” And it would be intended, really, primarily for him. He'd be the one
                    and only customer for it.</p>
                <p>As I said, it was offered to a number of class one officers and they turned it
                    down. Finally, apparently Henry decided, well, “Let's give Jim a crack at it;
                    let him try it. Let's work out the bugs in it and see how it goes.” So the unit
                    was set up under Walter Roberts. So I had to report, in a sense, to both. And
                    that began a fairly long period of intensive work on a great variety of agency
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I still feel that, that kind of independent unit, if you get the right people for
                    it, should be set apart from inspection; apart from the general administrative
                    setup, the lines of command, and so on, and be simply responsive to the front
                    office, with no stake in any kind of a solution.</p>
                <p>I'll cite only one example: Henry Loomis apparently had read the country plan for
                    Nicaragua. I'm talking now—we're already into 1970 and I, by this time, had gone
                    11 months without an assignment, permanent assignment. Apparently, for some
                    reason, maybe because he was planning to visit the Dominican Republic, as well
                    as other places, Loomis had looked at the country plan and then asked me to
                    write him an assessment of it, in my terms.</p>
                <p>I was astonished to discover that they had as many officers as we had—in 1970—in
                    Italy; as much money in their program, as we had in the Italian program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Dominican Republic. And I said, “What sense does this make?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the aftermath of that 1965 intervention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: That's right. And you know, nobody could shake it back down again or get
                    it down to a reasonable level. Well, I'm sure that Henry was surprised. And I'm
                    sure that the PAO must have been furious if he ever learned that I was the cause
                    for a fairly drastic cut in his program. But that was the sort of thing that
                    could be accomplished, without having too many bureaucratic wheels spinning.</p>
                <p>And I wrote countless papers on a great variety of Agency problems, you know,
                    anything that interested Henry.</p>
                <p>1972: Moceri's VOA Study</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that what eventuated in your VOA study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. Oh, it was for this one purpose that O'Brien became a temporary
                    member of my group. Because I think it was Henry Loomis who wanted O'Brien to
                    sit in on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a special assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, but in the sense that he was serving then as Loomis's eyes and ears.
                    And he was intrigued by the approach I adopted and the way we went about
                    tackling the problem. And I think that was the beginning of a genuinely serious
                    analysis of VOA broadcasting requirements and facilities. There had been
                    previous studies, such as Chet Opal's study of VOA, and a number of other
                    studies. However, none of them had really established a set of rational criteria
                    for an analysis of technical requirements, which is what the change was.</p>
                <p>I took and continue to take considerable pride in that undated 1972 VOA study of
                    mine, entitled “VOA Languages and Technical Facilities.” It was the first and
                    most basic of the several extensive analyses I prepared on VOA and international
                    short-wave broadcasting. I was greatly heartened by Loomis's very positive
                    reaction, especially in the light of his own very considerable experience in
                    VOA. When I concluded my summary presentation at the oral briefing he had set
                    up, his first remark to the group present was to the effect that “At long last
                    we have a real handle on VOA operating requirements.” My own view was that the
                    study should be viewed as the first step in a much-needed, thorough inquiry into
                    the entire spectrum of VOA operations. I very much wanted to do the one
                    follow-up study which would go to the heart of VOA operations, the nature and
                    rationale for VOA broadcasting as an instrumentality of the American government.
                    My field and Washington experience, especially the latter, had convinced me that
                    the phony claim of the VOA operatives to the broadcasting of uncontaminated,
                    objective news allowed them to get away with murder and constituted a gross
                    misconception of the role of VOA as a governmental entity and a media resource
                    for foreign audiences. Henry Loomis flatly turned me down on my plea for such a
                    study: it just was not worth the cost of a bloody battle. It took me a long time
                    to understand that Loomis was stating a fundamental, inviolable law of
                    bureaucracy: top managers never do battle with subordinate elements which are
                    believed to have a constituency in Congress or elsewhere in Washington.</p>
                <p>Parenthetically, Charles Wick's plan for a one billion dollar VOA modernization
                    program—about which I could learn nothing except for the meager account in the
                    New York Times—struck me as being the greatest boondoggle in the history of the
                    Agency.</p>
                <p>I feel that the 1972 study was at least the beginning of a fairly sane approach
                    to the problem of VOA requirements. And that led, eventually, to a 1976 study
                    that I did for the State Department, of VOA, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free
                    Europe technical requirements, which laid the basis for Congressional
                    authorization and funding of 17 new transmitters for the three broadcasters. The
                    conclusions of that '76 study were held over, on Kissinger's instructions, for
                    the new Carter Administration. Brzezinski wanted to review it himself before
                    anything was approved. But what was sent to Congress, as the report mandated by
                    Congress, was almost word for word the paper that I submitted to the State
                    Department when I was back there on consultation to do this study.</p>
                <p>Followed By Subsequent Studies In 1975 And 1976</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I had also done another VOA study, but that was in 1975, on the use of satellite
                    circuits, in place of our domestic stations, for relaying signals to our
                    overseas bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what was the date on which you officially
                        retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: April of 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were called back in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: In October of '76, and I was given six weeks to do that study, although
                    the State Department had been instructed many months before to meet a
                    Congressional mandate for a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S.
                    official international broadcasting. And I finished that. And as I said, the
                    report was submitted and then it was sent to the White House, to Kissinger, who
                    didn't want to act on it, because it was the end of the Ford Administration. And
                    so it was held over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carter was elected in '76.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. So he took office in January of '77. And Brzezinski held up the
                    report until he had a chance to review it and then submitted the same report to
                    Congress, as Carter's report. And in that report—and the recommendation was that
                    Congress appropriate the funds for the 17 additional transmitters that I said
                    were necessary for all three operations—each transmitter being allocated to
                    Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe, or the VOA. I was absolutely confident this
                    met the necessary and sufficient requirements for a adequate and audible
                    signal.</p>
                <p>I discussed the problem of jamming and the limitations of jamming. And I pointed
                    out that simply adding extra transmitters would not solve the problem, because
                    it was easy enough to add jammers to overcome any transmitters that were put on
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The other study in '75, I had replaced Walter Roberts as assistant director for
                    research, was on the use of satellite circuits in VOA relays to our overseas
                    facilities. I had just one tremendous battle with VOA.</p>

                <p>MOCERI: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have always had an argument with Ed Martin on
                        satellite transmission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The worst problem came from the director of VOA, who...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Ken Giddens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Ken Giddens. When, after my retirement I was called back for a few days
                    of consultation in connection with my study, I learned that there had been even
                    personal attacks in memoranda to the Director on me and my integrity. Because I
                    had proposed, in the study, the substitution of satellite circuits for all, or
                    most, of our domestic transmitters, and therefore, the elimination or
                    mothballing of those transmitters and the elimination of the 27 engineering
                    positions involved, to help pay for the cost of satellite transmission. I felt
                    we could get a 99.4% reliability in signal delivery. Intelsat and other
                    organizations stood by that assurance as a guarantee.</p>
                <p>And I had to face arguments about the Soviet ability to blast our satellites out
                    of the sky. And then where would we be? My retort was, “Well, when that day
                    comes, it doesn't make any difference whether VOA transmits or not.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The big balloon is up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Then I, of course, learned that in subsequent years they employed the
                    satellite circuits for relay purposes. Thus VOA got both the domestic
                    transmitters and the associated engineering which they preserved in the
                    positions and the satellite circuits, and so on. Part of a few strange battles
                    in VOA.</p>
                <p>Moceri Ends Agency Career First As Deputy, Then Director Of Research</p>
                <p>I suppose that about winds up my account. While I was the head of the analysis
                    and evaluation unit in IOP, a vacancy occurred in the office of research, the
                    deputy slot under Walter Roberts. Walter Roberts asked me to take that over, so
                    I became his deputy. When he left to go to the school...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went to the Board for International Broadcasting, at
                        that time, which was controlling both RL and RFE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: No, I think...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, that's right. Walter went first to the Center for
                        Strategic International Studies, with headquarters over there in the same
                        building with the International Club, 1800 K Street.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: So I was appointed—on Walter's recommendation—to the director's position
                    and ran research. I thought it needed a major reorganization, in terms of the
                    focus of research. I wanted it focused on our media activities abroad. I
                    distrusted much of the work that was done, in large measure because it had so
                    little relevance to field needs and problems. But I felt if we do this—for
                    instance, VOA research, audience research—I thought we had to do it on a
                    systematic basis; set up certain principles. And I know, there was tremendous
                    resistance on the part of the research staff proper, who, I think, saw me as a
                    person who wanted to make a lot of wild changes in their methods of operation
                    and their work. And, naturally, in part, resented me as a Foreign Service
                    officer. They were all civil servants, Ph.D.'s, or M.A.'s in sociology, in
                    social studies, expert in methodologies and no sensitivity to the realities of
                    field operations. And they couldn't see this person who wanted research that
                    had—could have operational inputs. And, you know, I like all Foreign Service
                    officers would be here today and gone tomorrow. So the problem was just to last
                    him out. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>At any rate, what I was trying to do was restructure research so that it would
                    have operational significance. Because I thought, this is the only way you're
                    going to make any sense in terms of our field operations. And we undertook, you
                    know, a great many studies. I had some problems with our director, on the
                    subject, particularly of VOA audiences. He was interested in impressing
                    Congress, and I didn't want him to go before congressional committees and make
                    statements...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which director are you talking about? VOA director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: No, no. The Agency director. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. Jim Keogh had come in as Director at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes. Jim Keogh. You know, I felt if you're testifying before Congress,
                    you'd better be able to back up your statements. The wild stories about immense
                    VOA audiences simply made no sense. And if you had a couple good questioners in
                    Congress, you could be mightily embarrassed. Because our research showed time
                    after time that audiences were much less than VOA people were talking about;
                    that audiences were concentrated in certain areas, and were certain kinds of
                    audiences. And that you couldn't talk about, you know, the majority of the
                    Russian people listening to VOA. All my evidence showed that in most parts of
                    the world, wherever we could do on-the-spot research, the VOA audience (those
                    who tuned in once a week or more often) in urban areas ran about 5% of the urban
                    adult population.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>There I borrowed an idea from Henry Loomis, the politically curious segment of a
                    population. That was the audience that should have interested VOA. Well, and
                    then things like our research on the magazine that the Agency was distributing
                    in Tehran. It was clear, from our research data—in a country where research is
                    difficult to conduct—that over 65% of the mailing list maintained by USIS
                    Tehran, never got the publications that were intended for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the PAO in Tehran at that time? It wasn't Gordon
                        Winkler, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was his baby. He thought that was the greatest
                        publication that ever existed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Yes, I know. [Laughter] You could image the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why I asked the question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: The interesting thing is that all those reports that I issued and
                    distributed in the Agency at that time were all unclassified. And if anybody in
                    Congress or any journalist had had any sense, he could make the Agency look
                    awful. And that was what I was worried about. But then I thought, you know,
                    leaving them unclassified is the best cover they've got. Because who's
                    interested in unclassified documents?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. If its not classified, people assume it isn't
                        important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: No, it's not important. And nobody asked the questions. I said to Jim
                    Keogh, “You know, what you're going to have to say, if someone in Congress asks
                    you about this particular magazine. Although we claim that the distribution
                    cost—production distribution cost—is $1.00 per copy, it's really $3.00 per
                    copy.” That gets pretty expensive, especially when you don't know who's getting
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Well, it was that kind of research that I felt was really important and really
                    would have an operational utility for our Foreign Service officers in the field.
                    Now, obviously, I had a lot of resistance. [Laughter] I encountered a lot of
                    resistance among our colleagues, PAOs and so on, who began to feel rather
                    uncomfortable with some of these studies.</p>
                <p>MOCERI: One of the last studies I directed concerned American investments in
                    Mexico and Mexican attitudes towards that investment. This was a research
                    project that was undertaken at the behest of the American Chamber of Commerce in
                    Mexico City. In what had become my standard operating procedure, I had to recast
                    the conclusions of the research report in order to make sense out of the data
                    and make it pertinent to the concerns that the Chamber of Commerce had
                    expressed. The Chamber of Commerce invited me to Mexico City to brief its
                    membership on the results of the study. It was my last foreign trip, in January
                    of 1976. And I took Dick Monsen along because I knew he was going to be my
                    replacement.</p>
                <p>I had to tell the American Chamber of Commerce the sad results of our research:
                    that they, themselves, had done the worst conceivable job with their own Mexican
                    staff. So how did they expect the attitudes of Mexicans outside of their own
                    organizations to be at all favorable to them, when their own employees, no
                    matter how high ranking—if they were Mexican—had no real understanding of the
                    role of the relationship of American investment to capital export, profit
                    earnings, etc. They were really in ignorance.</p>
                <p>So these results came as quite a shock to American industry, or American
                    business, in Mexico. And I suppose one could generalize from that, to American
                    business elsewhere, their own role. My God, if they do such a wretched job of
                    familiarizing their own staffs with their role in the country, how could they
                    expect the American Government to make amends for them, and straighten things
                    out, and gain universal acceptance, and so on? That was one, final, interesting
                    lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Jim, this has been a fascinating interview. I have
                        enjoyed it. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: Thank you.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOCERI: You're welcome. I've even deprived you of lunch. [Laughter]</p>
