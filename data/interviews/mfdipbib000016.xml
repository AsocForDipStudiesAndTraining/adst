                <p>AMBASSADOR ROBERT ANDERSON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Horace Torbert </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 12, 1990</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Anderson, we're very glad, indeed, to have you
                        with us this morning. You have a very long career and it's going to take a
                        while to do this, I think. But it's also a very fascinating one that covers
                        the whole world. I wonder if you'd like to start in by telling me something
                        about how you got into the Service, and how your interest in foreign affairs
                        started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Tully, I'm delighted to be here. I think it's a very important thing
                    for all of us to try and contribute whatever we can, because the Foreign Service
                    plays a tremendous historical role that often isn't recorded for history's sake.
                    And a few, I think, are worth it.</p>
                <p>How did I get interested in the Foreign Service? My father operated a very small
                    business outside of Boston and he purposely kept it small all his life. It was a
                    company with maybe 50 to 60 employees, and he used to travel six months a year.
                    And he was able to do it because of that. He became a tremendous friend to the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I guess the closest friend he had was Jim Penfield. And Jim would come to our
                    house when he'd come back on his infrequent visits to the U.S. at that
                    time—because the government never paid the way back for anybody. I had many
                    chances to talk with this Foreign Service “god,” as it were. There was another
                    one, named Andy Edson, whom, my father knew. I can't remember where he was
                    posted; I think it was out in the Far East. And then, from that time on, my
                    father always kept talking about the Foreign Service, what a wonderful way to
                    serve your country and have a beneficial career, in terms of fulfillment,
                    intellectual and otherwise.</p>
                <p>I went to school in England during the Depression. I got a scholarship and went
                    over to a prep school for a year, and then on to a public school for another
                    year until World War II was about to come along and my father decided to have me
                    back to the States in 1937, when I went to Andover and then Yale. I focused on
                    foreign affairs even back then, at Andover and at Yale. I remember Henry
                    Stimson, a very important trustee at Andover, came up to Andover to talk to a
                    group of us. I was allowed to be one of the young shavers to meet and talk with
                    him. He impressed me tremendously as a statesman and as such a wise man, who was
                    trying to help President Roosevelt at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>And then at Yale, I took the first Japanese language course that Yale ever
                    offered; and ended up in military intelligence in Washington, in Japanese
                    language work, with some very wonderful people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have a war class at Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, I was in the class of 1944. I went to school in the summer, before
                    I went into the Service, in January '43. And I took extra courses. The result
                    was that I did not have to return to Yale after the war; there were a few of us
                    that did that. I had to complete one course; it was in international law,
                    actually, which I did at George Washington University, with Francis Colt
                    DeWolfe. He was my teacher and he was a celebrated official in the State
                    Department for many, many years. You probably knew him. A result of that, Yale
                    accepted that one, final credit and I didn't have to go back to receive my
                    degree.</p>
                <p>I went into the Foreign Service while I was still on terminal leave from the
                    Army. I must say, I took the Foreign Service examination right after the war. It
                    was the first one they'd given in a number of years. All I can tell you is I
                    failed it absolutely miserably, because I'd been out of college for three years
                    and I'd been focusing on 3,000 or 4,000 Japanese characters, and that's enough
                    to send anybody to the loony bin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're in very good company, because I have many
                        friends who reached the top of the Service and failed the exam two or three
                        times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, well, I'm among those. I wouldn't say I reached the top, but I did
                    have a career that I absolutely loved. I never had an assignment I didn't
                    like.</p>
                <p>So what I did was sign on to the Foreign Service. Because despite the fact that I
                    failed the exam, I wanted to get in and do this. And I signed on as an auxiliary
                    vice consul, at that time; where they took a number of them, and even though I
                    knew Japanese, they sent me to China. I suppose that's typical of our
                    government.</p>
                <p>I went to Shanghai. As you and I discussed before this interview, your early
                    posts are essentially training; that's when the Service finds out if you've got
                    it or not, and if you can develop and progress. So I started out in Shanghai, in
                    the General Services section, as the fellow that was told to move all of the
                    household and office equipment that was arriving in Shanghai—to reopen all of
                    our posts in China. There were about a dozen of them. And there was no
                    commercial transportation whatsoever, air or sea. So I had a problem. What I did
                    was make friends with our Air Force people. I would find a space on this C-47 or
                    this C-46, and go and have drinks with them. And I had all of our things moved
                    at no expense to the State Department, to establish all of our posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a first-class dog robber. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's what it was. They gave me my first job in the political work.
                    And at one point they sent me on a trip to prepare an economic report.</p>
                <p>Then a very unusual man showed up one day. His nickname was “the walrus.” He
                    became one of the closest friends I ever had in the Foreign Service. He was
                    William Walton Butterworth, whom I absolutely adored, and his wife, Virginia. He
                    had sent word, before he arrived as our Minister in China, that he would
                    appreciate it if his lift vans would not be dropped in the Yangtze River, and
                    would not be pilfered by anybody. I was told that this was a rather formidable
                    person, and that it might be a good idea if I saw to it that his lift vans
                    arrived from Shanghai to Nanking with no mishaps.</p>
                <p>I went down on the Yangtze River, at the harbor in Shanghai, and I stayed with
                    those vans until they arrived in Nanking. Nothing was broken; no damage. The
                    Minister came down to Shanghai afterwards and said he wanted to meet the person
                    who shipped his effects to Nanking. This is not a very nice thing to say, but I
                    have to say it. Our Consul General was Monnett B. Davis. I had never met Monnett
                    B. Davis, though I had been in his Consulate General for damn near a year. And
                    Butterworth asked him, “Would you find out the fellow who got my effects up to
                    Nanking? I'd like to meet him.” And I was escorted, for the first time in my
                    life, into the consul general's office. And I had never met Monnett B.
                    Davis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My gracious! How big a consulate general was it? I mean,
                        how many American officers were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Put it this way, Tully, it wasn't that big. [Laughter] I think it was
                    the personality of the Consul General. I introduced myself to the Consul General
                    in front of Mr. Butterworth. And I said, “I'm delighted to meet you, Sir.”</p>
                <p>And Butterworth said to me afterwards: “You never met this man before?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, Sir, I haven't.” And then he told me: “Look, I want you up in
                    Nanking. You know, this is ridiculous.” I guess the only reason I'm mentioning
                    this little story is for younger people who come into the Service. I maintain
                    that every officer gets a chance, gets an opening, but a lot of people don't
                    recognize it. If you meet a challenge successfully, something is going to happen
                    and you're going to go up. And that was the first one I had; it was getting
                    those lift vans to Nanking. I did the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>There's a fellow named Jim McKenna I have to mention to you. He was the first
                    Foreign Service officer I ever met in Shanghai, when I arrived on a weekend. I
                    was all charged up and said, “Boy, they can't wait to see this young, vigorous
                    vice consul come to set the affairs of Shanghai and China straight.” And I
                    walked into this fellow's office. And he had a hat on at his desk. He was the
                    number two in the Consulate General. He's smoking the biggest cigar I've ever
                    seen—Jim McKenna, from New England. He was there with a big pile of telegrams,
                    going through them.</p>
                <p>He looked up over his glasses at me and wondered what I was doing there. And I
                    told him I was assigned here. And he didn't know who I was. I didn't have a
                    room; they didn't have a room for me, nothing. I slept on a couch at the Cathay
                    Hotel; at the foot of twin beds, where two other officers were sleeping. That's
                    how tight things were. I found out later that McKenna spent as much time as he
                    could in his office, because his wife wouldn't let him smoke cigars at home. He
                    was a wonderful guy.</p>
                <p>I went up to Nanking. Butterworth, a very foresighted man, felt that we should
                    start a major biographic data program for China. And I was put in charge of
                    that, started it right from scratch, had a full-time gal working who was a
                    specialist and who came from Washington. And we built up a mammoth biographic
                    program for all of China.</p>
                <p>I went around to different offices and taught people how to make reports, and not
                    just these old-fashioned, formal full reports, but little squibs; cutting out
                    items from newspapers and other publications. I was sent over to Taipei in
                    Formosa to get things started. Later we managed to get all that information out,
                    which gave us a tremendous amount of background on the Communist regime that
                    eventually took over. We wouldn't have had anything but for that.</p>
                <p>Washington still hadn't figured out whether the Chinese Communists were agrarian
                    reformers or communists. So they split the embassy in half. And seeing that I
                    was young, single and expendable, I guess, I was told to stay behind with John
                    Wesley Jones, who was one of the dearest friends I ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: And who was partially responsible for my marriage. He was very close to
                    the Italian ambassador in China, whose daughter I married. But Johnny was sort
                    of a father to me out there. He was a dear, dear person.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We stayed behind after the communists took over. They took over on April 21,
                    1949, and we were essentially locked up until we got out in October. When we
                    tried to go to the office a couple of times, they'd ram bayonets through the
                    radiators of our cars. So a couple of us were dumb enough to say the heck with
                    this, and we'd creep around and go through back alleys, because we wanted to get
                    over the chancery so we could send a telegram or two. We were finally evacuated
                    in October, that year, from Shanghai.</p>
                <p>Now, there were two other people in Nanking I wanted to mention to you. One was
                    Livy [Livingston] Merchant. He was a very close friend of Walt Butterworth; they
                    went to Princeton together. And Livy had been a very, very successful investment
                    banker, living in New Jersey. And then he, as you probably know—you know him
                    better than I do—decided to get into the Foreign Service at a rather advanced
                    age.</p>
                <p>A lot of us couldn't figure out why a successful investment banker, with
                    everything in the world, would come out and live in Nanking, China, with a
                    beautiful wife, Betty, and children.</p>
                <p>He told us that he just got absolutely fed up with spending most of his life on
                    the train, between his house and his office. He said: “I would leave in the
                    morning and wouldn't see my children before they went to school. And I would
                    come back at night and they'd already be in bed. That's no way to live.” Well,
                    of course, he turned out to be one of the top people, we've ever had in the
                    Service; I think he's just absolutely wonderful.</p>
                <p>The other fellow is Philip Crowe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't realized he was out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Phil went there as Roger Lapham's man. Do you remember the China Relief
                    Mission?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Phil was the head of it in Nanking. That was our first post-war aid
                    program, really; right after the war, as I recall. Phil was administering that.
                    We became very close friends. He managed somehow to have an embassy every time
                    the Republicans came into power; I think he had five throughout his career. He
                    had his first heart attack when he was out there, just as the communists were
                    coming. The question was how to get him out.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We had an old Army ambulance, that we received from the military a while back—and
                    I drove him through the retreating Chinese Kuomintang lines to the last plane to
                    leave Nanking. I must say, I wasn't worried about the communist troops coming
                    in, but I was very concerned about the retreating Kuomintang troops. They were
                    much nastier than the victors coming in, who weren't quite as nervous, they were
                    on top of the world, as it were. And it was a fairly hairy little ride in the
                    ambulance, but we got Phil there, thank God, and put him on the plane. We waved
                    goodbye and off Livy and Phil Crowe went.</p>
                <p>But after that, I came back to Washington with a rather bad case of amoebic
                    dysentery. There were no medicines left in Nanking so it was pretty well
                    advanced, and they, the doctors, were concerned about it. So I spent about three
                    months or more, every day of my life, at Walter Reed Hospital. I became the
                    second guinea pig, if you will, for aureomycin, the medicine they were just
                    developing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank God for it. They used it on me some years
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: They hadn't really figured out the right mixture. I went through more
                    courses than you can shake a stick at. But I finally got rid of it and then got
                    married in February of '50, in Florence, Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, was your father-in-law in Washington by
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No. He didn't come until the 60s.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington. I worked temporarily in the Far Eastern Bureau, where
                    Walt Butterworth was Assistant Secretary. Livy Merchant was the Assistant
                    Secretary for Europe.</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I resigned from the Foreign Service from about May or April until
                    August, 1950, because my father came down to Washington and he said that he
                    really had to have me take over the family business, that he was getting too old
                    and he couldn't do it anymore. He really was quite emotional about it. My dear
                    wife, who didn't marry me to go and live outside of Boston to run a paper box
                    business she said: “Well, look. Your father needs you. You go and do it. Come
                    on, we have to do it.”</p>
                <p>So I did. But it was quite apparent that he was still running it and wanted to
                    run it. And it was not a challenge for me. It didn't work out and he finally
                    said: “Well, you better get back into the Foreign Service.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>So I came back to Washington and saw Livy Merchant. I bought back my retirement
                    that I had collected on, so I wouldn't have a break in service. Then Walt
                    Butterworth said to me: “Well, you and Elena are married now. I know just the
                    place for you two. We're setting up a bunch of listening posts around China. And
                    there's one up in northern Thailand, called Chieng Mai. That'll be just the
                    place for you. And you can open the first American consulate.”</p>
                <p>And so I did. Elena and I went there and it was the happiest time I could have
                    imagined. The ambassador there was Ed Stanton. Edwin and Josie Stanton were a
                    wonderful couple. I learned about as much from them, on how this Foreign Service
                    really should work, as from anybody—the Butterworths and the Stantons and Johnny
                    Jones and a few others.</p>
                <p>But opening the first American consulate up there was quite a trick because, you
                    know, it was up in the jungles and no official presence ever. And that was quite
                    a thrill. And you were on your own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of a city is Chieng Mai, or was it then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was the royal capital of the north. As far as the city's concerned,
                    well, it was a very backward town. It had the Bombay-Burma Company, Borneo
                    Company—huge teak operations, so there were a few Brits up there, but it wasn't
                    a city in any sense of the word. We leased the palace of the former ruler of
                    Chieng Mai, which is very, very nice and with a beautiful garden. Incidentally,
                    I had one American helper, a male clerk. Between us, we did everything; we did
                    the coding, I was my own USIS officer. My wife and I went out into the jungles
                    with a projector. I had to learn how to do that and operate a generator. We
                    showed movies to people out in the countryside. And it was just great. Today,
                    they have three or four USIS people, AID people, and all sorts of others. I
                    don't know what the hell they all are doing up there, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: English was generally spoken?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: In Thailand, yes. It's amusing, but it shows the stupidity of the
                    administrative world at the State Department, in my view—I got my only official
                    reprimand in my career when I was in Chieng Mai. I did not appreciate it, to put
                    it mildly. The embassy, before I ever heard of Chieng Mai, had gone into the
                    State Department, and they estimated that $2,500 would be needed to furnish the
                    residence of the new consulate. And so I arrived in Bangkok and the ambassador
                    and the administrative officer said, “Here's $2,500 for you to furnish the new
                    consulate.”</p>
                <p>I then went home and I said to my dear wife, Elena: “Dear, here is $2,500 for you
                    to furnish the consulate,” because she was going to buy and choose. She
                    ultimately had the most beautiful teak furniture you've ever seen specially
                    made. And I said: “Now, don't spend over $2,500 or I'm in trouble. If you can
                    save some money, do it.”</p>
                <p>Well, she saved $800, so we only spent $1,700 instead of $2,500. I got an
                    official reprimand for that because the $2,500 had not been spent. I had seldom
                    been angrier. Ambassador Stanton went back with the biggest rocket that you've
                    ever seen. I just thought this ought to be noted for posterity's sake.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I was up there in Chieng Mai for about six or seven months. Ambassador Stanton
                    and his wife, they loved it up there and kept coming up to visit us, not just to
                    open the consulate, but to work with us in the area. He followed everything I
                    was doing, finally said: “Look, you've had enough of a vacation.” [Laughter] “I
                    need you. I want you down there. Josie and I love Elena, and we want you to come
                    down and come into the political section.”</p>
                <p>And I said: “Yes, Sir.” I guess that's another thing. You do a fairly good job
                    and then another thing happens. And I ended up in the political section with
                    Norm Hannan and Rolland Bushner and Bill Turner was the deputy, whom I'll talk
                    about a little bit later, and later knew in Bombay, India.</p>
                <p>And I was down and spent a year and a half in Bangkok—left in December, 1950. Our
                    first daughter was born in early December, in Rome, and I returned just in time.
                    I had a wonderful time in Bangkok, learning for the first time how to be a line
                    officer in a political section.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Stanton was so perfect in guiding us. There were three major political
                    figures and three political officers. We each took one. I was the junior one and
                    so I was assigned the toughest, the one most unlikely to succeed. But he did! He
                    became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: We all worked together so well, thanks to the leadership of Stanton.
                    There was a successful coup; they captured the prime minister, Phibun Songgram.
                    We were at a ceremony for a barge we were giving to them. Bill Turner, the
                    charg� d'affaires, was on the barge. I'll never forget it.</p>
                <p>We were standing in the middle of a bridge and Mrs. Turner, who was deaf, was
                    there near us. And all of a sudden, Siamese Marines started popping up from
                    under the bridge, I don't know where they came from. Poor Mrs. Turner, they had
                    fired a few shots in the air, but she couldn't hear anything.</p>
                <p>So I picked up the charg�'s wife and just tucked her under my arm. And I patted
                    her head and I said: “Now don't worry, Mrs. Turner. Come on, off we go,” and got
                    her the hell out of there before we were going to have anything happen to us.
                    [Laughter] And from then on, the Turners and the Andersons were very, very close
                    friends.</p>
                <p>One other item, regarding my stay in Bangkok, that I do want to put on the record
                    here, was our very great concern over some of the CIA activities in Thailand.
                    That organization was still pretty new, let's remember, and the people they had
                    out there were very indiscreet. I felt so strongly that I made a very detailed
                    report, backed up with nothing but facts, of all the breaches of security that
                    they made; talking in bars, etc., about things they were doing. Many of them
                    talked too much, and I felt that this had to be brought under control. So I did
                    this report, and it went to Ambassador Stanton. He was disturbed by it, but it
                    was sent in. I must say, the Agency was very, very unhappy with me. But on
                    balance, I think it was something that had to be done because they not only
                    cleaned up their act there, but I think it probably made them more conscious
                    eventually to be more careful elsewhere around the world. And when I get to the
                    Paris days, later on, there's a story there I want to talk about, also.</p>
                <p>I left Bangkok in late 1950 for Washington and work on the Southeast Asia desk.
                    The reason for that, incidentally, was because dear Phil Bonsal, was the Office
                    Director for Southeast Asian Affairs. He had come to Bangkok when I was there
                    and we became very good friends.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, that was a very bad period. Because of financial considerations,
                    the Department was having one of its periodic reduction in force, freeze
                    hirings, and what have you. And for a while there it was touch and go if I was
                    even going to get another assignment, which disappointed me somewhat after the
                    job I'd done in China and Chieng Mai and Bangkok; I thought I'd started off a
                    fairly respectable career.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>But finally, a very good friend of mine found an opening in New Delhi, India, and
                    I was sent out in 1953 and had a wonderful assignment there. It was absolutely
                    fascinating, in the political section. George Allen was one of the more
                    imaginative ambassadors I've ever met. He made me his special assistant. I also
                    was told to cover internal politics, to serve as the acting labor attach� for my
                    two years there (because a very colorful gentleman, named Henri Sokolove, became
                    ill, and had to leave, the AFL and CIO couldn't agree with the State Department
                    on who could come out as the labor attach� until just before I left).</p>
                <p>So I had three jobs, all of which were absolutely fascinating because India was
                    still a very new country. As you know, it's a country that has many different
                    languages. The linguistic-states problem, under Nehru, was a very difficult
                    question. How Nehru managed that, I will never know, but he did and he was able
                    to form a single nation out of such disparate groups. And I had to try to cover
                    all of that.</p>
                <p>And incidentally—and this is an historical fact of interest—while I was there,
                    the first communist government that ever came into power through a democratic
                    election was elected in the state of Kerala, in south India. But I don't need to
                    say any more about that. I can assure you there's plenty of reporting on that
                    one, if anybody wants to read it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Nehru some?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. George Allen was thoughtful. He had me with him on every single
                    thing that you could imagine. He introduced me to Nehru, I went with him a
                    couple of times on his calls. Nehru was a fascinating human being and very calm,
                    unassuming, quiet, but with a mind like a steel trap. He and George Allen got
                    along absolutely beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nehru and George Allen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. And then John Sherman Cooper came out as ambassador three months
                    before I was due to leave. He told me that I was not to leave until July 5,
                    1955. My wife and the children had left in March and I was anxious to join them.
                    But he said: “Look, we don't know anybody. We have this July Fourth reception
                    and you're about the only one left that knows anybody,” which was true. So I
                    stayed through that and we became very, very close friends as a result of that
                    and saw each other through the years, after he joined the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a pretty good ambassador? Of course, he didn't stay
                        in India very long. I knew him later, as a senator, of course. He was a
                        great guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. He did not stay there very long and there's a little story about
                    that I want to tell you. I can't say that he stayed there long enough to make
                    any particular mark on United States interests with India; I can't recall any. I
                    was back in Washington as the Ceylon/Nepal Desk Officer and the assistant India
                    Desk Officer, after I left India.</p>
                <p>We might jump to that right now, because it involves John Sherman Cooper. He came
                    back shortly after I arrived in '55, and he asked if he could talk with me
                    alone. We went into his office and shut the door and he said: “Bob, I have a
                    difficult problem. I don't know what to do.” “President Eisenhower wants me to
                    run for the Senate from Kentucky. But I haven't been in India long enough.
                    What's this going to do to our relations, and what's Nehru going to think of me
                    and think of us, with my leaving so soon? I don't really know what I should tell
                    the president. I really don't know what to do.”</p>
                <p>And I said: “Mr. Ambassador, if you don't want to run for the Senate, that's one
                    thing. If your concern is about what Mr. Nehru is going to think, I don't think
                    you should be worried about that, because Nehru is very much of a politician,
                    and he knows that if the President of the United States asks you to take on a
                    political assignment, such as being one of 48 senators, he's going to understand
                    that. I don't think that you need to worry about that aspect at all. Plus the
                    fact you haven't been there a year yet, almost. You go back, it'll be another
                    six months before anything really happens; you know that. Then you'll have time
                    to campaign. And I really think that you've got to make up your mind on what the
                    president has asked you to do. And if you want to be a senator, I think you
                    ought to do what the president wants you to do.”</p>
                <p>And he put his arm around me, thanked me and walked out. He went back, saw Nehru,
                    and eventually came back, to become a senator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He asked for my thoughts, and that is why we became very, very close.
                    There are so many fascinating things that happened when I was back in the State
                    Department, from '55 to '59. There's no point in talking about many of them, but
                    one event that changed the traditional way of handling ambassadorial appointees
                    happened, when I was the Ceylon desk officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There was a gentleman named Maxwell H. Gluck, whom Jack Javits had persuaded
                    Eisenhower to name as Ambassador to Ceylon. He owned a clothing store chain
                    called the Darling Stores. He also had one of the largest racehorse
                    establishments in America, the Elmendorf Farm in Kentucky. In those days, an
                    outsider, as you will remember, could not come to the Department and receive any
                    briefing whatsoever until he was confirmed by the Senate. He went before the
                    Senate—Fulbright was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee—and
                    he was asked the name of the prime minister, and became flustered. By the way,
                    nobody from the State Department was ever up there, to help these guys; they
                    were on their own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. We did it, of course, totally
                        differently.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He became very flustered, and told the Committee: “I don't know.” And
                    the press and Fulbright jumped on it, and that was it; the fat was in the fire.
                    Now, the prime minister's name happens to be Solomon West Ridgway D�az
                    Bandaranaike. Well, you know, you either know that or you don't. He said “I knew
                    his last name, but,” he said, “I was afraid that if I didn't say it all, or that
                    if I made a mistake I would be insulting the prime minister that I was going to
                    have to deal with.”</p>
                <p>Now, for a fellow who ran a lingerie department store chain to think like that, I
                    thought was pretty damn good. And I thought the press and Fulbright were very
                    unfair to him. But there it was. And John Foster Dulles, to put it mildly, was
                    very disturbed. Butts Macomber and Rod O'Connor, who were the Secretary's two
                    special assistants, and also happened to be classmates of mine at Yale, saw me
                    and asked: “What the hell is going on here? Should this guy go to Ceylon?”</p>
                <p>I said: “I don't know. I'll tell you later, I first have to meet him” My wife and
                    I spent one month with Mr. and Mrs. Gluck, arranging briefings, day and night,
                    on Buddhism, on cultural life, on political and economic conditions and the
                    history of the area. Nobody has ever had briefings like that fellow.</p>
                <p>And at the end of the month, I was summoned by Bill Rountree and George Allen
                    (George was the assistant secretary and Bill was his deputy). Bill Macomber and
                    Rod O'Connor came down from the Secretary's office. They said to me: “Well,
                    should he go?”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>And I said: “Well, first of all, he has to go. You can't, six weeks later,
                    suddenly say no. He's been confirmed by the Senate and everything else now.
                    Secondly, just to give you some peace of mind, he's not going to be a disaster;
                    he can go. And we've probably had others who were worse than this guy. He'll be
                    fine and he's a very decent person.” The conclusion to this is very important.
                    That was the last time in our history that an outside political appointee ever
                    went up to the Hill without a State Department briefing. It was that case that
                    did it. And I made that recommendation to Dulles, because Macomber took me up to
                    Dulles afterwards and I said: “Mr. Secretary, I think, this business of you and
                    others not seeing these people before they are confirmed, because of our fear of
                    treading on the toes of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is wrong. We
                    have to do it.” And so that is a little historical vignette.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you just finished talking about the famous Gluck
                        case, which, of course, the whole world heard the opening of, but very few
                        people heard what a success he made of himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Ambassador Gluck did a passable job out in Ceylon. He didn't drop any
                    major balls and the Ceylonese liked him. They had a couple of flood
                    catastrophes, and he was flying around dropping bags of flour. It was fine. And
                    above all, he cared and he tried to do a good job.</p>
                <p>I was in this job, in the South Asian office, for a couple of years. Then in '57,
                    Bill Macomber, who was John Foster Dulles' special assistant got hold of me. And
                    he said: “Look, the Public Affairs Bureau has a disaster on its hands. They have
                    an office there, which is the public correspondence office. The Secretary's
                    letters aren't getting answered. And the Secretary is receiving increasing
                    criticism.” Andy Berding, who was the assistant secretary and very close to me
                    later on, was so busy being the Secretary's press chief that he had to rely on
                    his staff to run the Bureau and needed a new staff assistant. Bill and Andy
                    asked me if I would reorganize the bureau, which at that time, incidentally, had
                    the cultural affairs. Al Lightner was one of Andy's deputies, and Burt Wilkinson
                    was the other deputy on the domestic side.</p>
                <p>And so I went over there and did reorganize the bureau, particularly with regard
                    to the handling of correspondence that came to the Secretary of State, either
                    from Congress or from the public. Everything was under control; we managed not
                    to lose letters; we answered letters on time; we coordinated with the different
                    bureaus to make sure that the substance was correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Record keeping, probably, was a part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. Record keeping. It was an enormous operation. We didn't have a lot
                    of these modern tools they have now in the State Department. That was a
                    wonderful challenge, which I enjoyed very much—working with Andy Berding—because
                    that led me into the press business for the first time. Linc White was the
                    spokesman. Joe Read was his deputy. And Bob McCloskey was hired as a magazine
                    officer. I came to know them well. It was a challenge which I enjoyed.</p>
                <p>There's one Foreign Service case that came up while I was there, that I fought
                    for because I felt very strongly about it; and fortunately it came out the right
                    way. It involved Charles Whitehouse, who was back as Doug Dillon's Special
                    Assistant. He had applied to enter the Foreign Service laterally. He'd been in
                    the Central Intelligence Agency at one point, served with very great distinction
                    in some foreign posts, including Africa, as well as Belgium. And there was an
                    effort by the establishment not to take him in, which I did not appreciate. And
                    part of it had to do with his family background; the fact that he was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little too much “Newport?” [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: A little too much “Newport,” a lot too much money. Why should this guy
                    get in? I didn't like that attitude, and the fact he was working with Doug
                    Dillon was even held against him. But this fellow had shown his mettle. So Bill
                    Macomber and I and a couple of others went after this.</p>
                <p>I told people, I said: “I'm going to blow the whistle on this if this fellow
                    isn't let in. Unless you have some legitimate reason that in his past career
                    with the Agency or someplace else he wasn't able to perform well, which I am
                    unaware of, he should be accepted.” He became a Foreign Service Officer, and has
                    been one of the more distinguished members of our service. I think you'd agree
                    with that. He's done a hell of a job. He did an outstanding job in Vietnam and
                    he's taken on some of the toughest assignments we have; he hasn't been in the
                    cushy ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the American Foreign Service Association.
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, he was president of it, wasn't he, for a while?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and during a difficult—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: And during a very difficult period. So that was something that I did
                    enjoy doing while I was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Then it came time for me, finally, to go abroad again. And William L. Blue—dear
                    Bill Blue, with whom I served in India, was in personnel at the time—this was in
                    '59, when it came time for me to go out—and I decided that I really ought to
                    learn a foreign language, preferably French. And so we figured that I'd spent
                    ten or eleven years out in the Far East, and I was gradually moving westward,
                    but not fast enough. And so my dear wife said: “Look, let's go to France where
                    your can learn the language.”</p>
                <p>Phil Crowe, whom I mentioned earlier, was back in Washington, and it was time for
                    him to get another embassy, because of the change of administration. And so
                    South Africa came up, and he wanted me to go there as his political counselor.
                    It would have been a great promotion and all that, but I preferred not to go.
                    And so whom did I get to take my place? Charlie Whitehouse. And Charlie loved
                    it. He and Phil got along well and it was a great assignment for him.</p>
                <p>So Bill Blue found two assignments in Paris. They weren't in the embassy, they
                    were with international organizations. And I said: “No thanks.” And he looked at
                    me as if I were half mad. I said: “If you have an opening in one of the
                    consulates, anyplace, that is where I'd like to go, because I would like to
                    learn to speak French and I don't want to be in Paris with 55,000 Americans. I
                    want to be out in the provinces, where I can really come to know France and try
                    to learn the language.”</p>
                <p>An opening came in Bordeaux and that's where I went. That really changed my whole
                    career. They, frankly, were the two happiest years of my career, in a way. I can
                    say happiest, because I didn't have any earthshaking responsibilities in those
                    two delightful years to try and not only learn the French language and the
                    countryside, but to appreciate the finest wine in the world.</p>
                <p>I became very, very close friends with Jacques Chaban-Delmas, still mayor of
                    Bordeaux today, and Prime Minister when I went back years later under Sarge
                    Shriver, which I'll get to when we next meet. Chaban put up with my inability to
                    speak French when I first got there. But after six months, I then gave my first
                    speech in French. I'd had a tutor and worked every day and was determined to
                    learn it and did, finally, which was a tremendous thing for me to focus on. I
                    enjoyed it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had had, presumably, the standard no-speaking
                        education [in a foreign language]? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, I took all the French they had to offer at Yale, and the result of
                    that was you couldn't speak French when you finished it, because you don't learn
                    a language through your eyes, you learn it through your ears; and that's the
                    only way to do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Bordeaux was a tremendous experience for me because I learned about France. The
                    people who go to Paris, and stay there for four to five years, don't know
                    anything about France, really. Paris is so different. I had told them in
                    Washington, Bill Blue and others, “If I do well in Bordeaux, and if I learn the
                    language, I would then like to have a crack at Paris, if an opening comes.”</p>
                <p>Well, an opening came. I spent two years in Bordeaux and then went to Paris in
                    April, 1961 for two exciting years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to clear that up, what did you actually do in
                        Bordeaux?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: As the number-two man in the Consulate General, I was assigned as the
                    political/economic officer. It was a small post of four officers. We had more
                    than enough to do, I can assure you.</p>
                <p>I was next assigned as a commercial officer in Paris, working for a very
                    remarkable economic minister in the beginning. He was Jacques Reinstein, a hard
                    taskmaster, but so bright and stimulating.</p>
                <p>This was a very active period in the formation of the European community, of its
                    common agricultural policy, of its common commercial policy. We also had our
                    bilateral problems with the French in trade, quotas, you name it.</p>
                <p>Right after I arrived, President Kennedy came over for his state visit to General
                    de Gaulle. Jim Gavin was our ambassador. I was assigned to his visit as they
                    needed somebody who spoke French. I was camped out at the Quai d'Orsay in the
                    President's quarters, to take care of anything that came up. My wife, bilingual
                    in French, was assigned to Jackie Kennedy, to do anything she could to be
                    helpful.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Gavin saw me during the President's visit and followed a couple of
                    problems I had to deal with. He decided to change his special assistant and
                    decided on me. Jack Reinstein successfully blocked the transfer. When the next
                    special assistant didn't work out, General Gavin went to Cecil Lyon, his deputy,
                    and said: “I'm going back to Jacques Reinstein. And I want Bob Anderson down in
                    this office by December 1.” He went to Jacques and said: “That's the end of it;
                    there's no more discussion. Bob is going to move and work in my office.”</p>
                <p>And Cecil told me, he said: “You've got to save the name of the Service. Two of
                    our members have fallen. You must go and do the job.” And he couldn't have been
                    nicer. Basically, what General Gavin wanted was a chief of staff. Well, that is
                    the Minister's job.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>It was a very delicate job in terms of my relations with Cecil, whom I liked and
                    respected and with Randy Kidder, the political counselor, with whom I've been so
                    close ever since. They were very senior; I was very junior. They all were 100%
                    behind me and I was able to do the job to satisfy General Gavin.</p>
                <p>Here again that shows that if you are given a challenge and can cut the mustard,
                    as we say, you will be given new challenges and move up the ladder.</p>
                <p>General Gavin was one of the most amazing men I have ever met. He had mixed
                    reviews as Ambassador to France. A lot of the things that the press wrote were
                    superficial, unfounded and unjust—they didn't really know what they were talking
                    about. He had the respect of the intellectual community and the scientific
                    community, for example, like no one I have ever met.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background in the military originally? Was he
                        an engineering officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He was a tremendous airborne combat officer, with his last job as head
                    of research and development in the Pentagon. He broke with Eisenhower because he
                    felt that the Administration was not giving enough attention to research and
                    development. He retired and made President of Arthur D. Little and Company. Two
                    months later, Kennedy asked him to go to Paris. The board let him go for 18
                    months or something like that, and said: “If you don't come back then, that's
                    it,” which is why he had to leave; because he had five daughters and needed the
                    A.D. Little income.</p>
                <p>One example of his imagination, he called me into his office one day and said:
                    “Bob, I've just been reading some things about the laser beam. You know, we
                    ought to think more about this, all of us. You know, I can envisage that one day
                    the medical profession may be able to use this to save our eyes and the brain.”
                    This is unbelievable; we didn't know much about the laser then, mind you; this
                    was 1962. And this man saw this back then.</p>
                <p>As far as the Foreign Service was concerned, he considered one of our biggest
                    weaknesses to be our lack of training. He said: “In the military,” he said,
                    “people are able to earn advanced degrees because, you know, we're a
                    war-fighting machine, and so when we're not at war these people can spend maybe
                    a third of their career or so in training. You poor people don't have this
                    leeway, because the Foreign Service is always at war, basically, the war of
                    diplomacy.”</p>
                <p>One other item concerning Paris and the CIA. This is something they do
                    occasionally, and I was up in arms about it. Some of us may have an excellent
                    source, and then without telling us, the Agency will try to recruit the
                    source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On an exclusive basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, and pay him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And pay him, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think that is the dumbest policy imaginable, and have made myself
                    very clear on a number of occasions, to the Agency. What it did once in my
                    career was to jeopardize an invaluable source, who had been close to us for
                    years. We almost lost him because he felt insulted. The source happened to be a
                    friend of mine of over 20 years. One did not need to pay this source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob McBride had the same observation from being there a
                        little earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was an insult to an outstanding gentleman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, Bob and I worked on some of the same things, as you can imagine.
                    He was the DCM when I was director of Western Europe—your old job.</p>
                <p>I received word to go back and work with George Ball, as one of his two Special
                    Assistant, replacing Art Hartman. I came back in the summer of '63 and was with
                    him for two years.</p>
                <p>It was an unbelievable experience working with this man. I'm not sure that there
                    has ever been such a harmonious and productive relationship between a Secretary
                    of State and an Under Secretary than there was between Dean Rusk and George
                    Ball. I was with them many evenings working till nine or ten at night, so I had
                    a good chance to see them operating together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Rusk never quit till ten; that was a standard day
                        for him. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The two of them were just wonderful together. There was no back-biting,
                    they had confidence in each other, they complemented each other in so many
                    different ways. Thanks to working with George, I came to know Dean Rusk well
                    then, and later on, when I went down into the European Bureau. He was a
                    remarkable human being, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I saw a great deal of him, of course, during that
                        same period or a little later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: There are so many different things when I was working with George Ball
                    that came up. I assume that virtually everything he did is already on record.
                    But there are a couple of little things of possible interest that may not have
                    been recorded.</p>
                <p>One of them is the day that John Kennedy was shot in Texas. It happened around
                    lunchtime, and I was there in the office, having a sandwich. George was Acting
                    Secretary and involved in a luncheon outside the Department. His secretary,
                    Helen Hanainy, returned after a quick lunch and ran into my office to say: “I
                    just heard the President was shot.”</p>
                <p>I said: “What? What are you talking about?” We turned on the radio and, yes, he
                    had. And so we reached George Ball as quickly as possible, and he began to take
                    over as the overall coordinator insofar as the foreign nations were
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as delegations to the funeral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The first thing that had to be done—and here history was changed in a
                    way—was to get hold of the Secretary of State. I was told to do this. I was the
                    one who told the Secretary that John Kennedy was shot. And how did I get him? I
                    reached him on a lane over the Pacific with four other members of the Cabinet
                    who were on their way to Japan. I said: George says it might be a good idea to
                    have that plane reverse course and return as fast as possible.” The Secretary
                    said: “Aye, aye.” That was that. The only point I want to make is, that that was
                    the last time in history that a large number of Cabinet members were allowed to
                    travel together.</p>
                <p>Moving on from this tragedy, I did see Harold Wilson with George, right after he
                    was elected Prime Minister. We were in London at the time, and George was the
                    first official American to talk with him. As I recall, it was a three-hour
                    meeting, with four of us—Harold Wilson, his private secretary, George Ball and
                    me. I took the notes on that one, dictated them to two or three secretaries and
                    had it sent back to the President and the Secretary within a matter of hours.
                    That's all on the record. We obtained a very good picture of what Wilson had in
                    mind and because he was a very good friend of George he was unusually
                    forthcoming to him.</p>
                <p>Remember the MLF, the Multilateral Force issue?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That was a tremendous struggle when I was with George, between Mac
                    Bundy and George; Mac was totally against it. We were going over to Europe and
                    Mac found out about our trip. So he sent Richard Neustadt over two days before
                    we left to visit the same capitals and see the same people we would be seeing.
                    The purpose was basically, to scuttle our trip.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>We found out about Neustadt's tips, and sent out a telegram, drafted by George
                    Ball himself, to our embassies, pointing out that: “Richard Neustadt is coming.
                    He has no power to negotiate anything. He is there to listen and that is it.” It
                    was an example of quite a struggle that occasionally went on between those two
                    strong personalities.The MLF never was created. This was a mistake. I think it
                    should have been born and could have been quite helpful.</p>
                <p>When I left George in the summer of 1965, I went to the European Bureau, where
                    John Leddy was Assistant Secretary. I was Acting Director for Western Europe for
                    the first year. When they reorganized the Bureau, I became the Country Director
                    for France and the Benelux for two years. In the summer of '68, I went back to
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>A rather momentous event happened at the time in which our Bureau was deeply
                    involved. It was the withdrawal of France from the integrated military
                    structure, the Atlantic Alliance. We faced many challenges working with the Hill
                    to make sure the Hill wouldn't completely destroy our relations with France,
                    which we all felt had to be maintained somehow in the face of de Gaulle's
                    onslaught.</p>
                <p>Dean Acheson came in as a Special Assistant to the Secretary, you may remember.
                    And young Larry Eagleburger was assigned as Dean Acheson's Staff Assistant by
                    Ball's office. An excellent choice. Acheson's mission was to focus on: “All
                    right, de Gaulle has done this, now what do we do?” George Ball was the point
                    man on this whole subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ball left in what, late '65, early '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, he stayed on most of the time when I was in the European
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Nick Katzenbach was there for about the last year or
                        so of the administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or a year and a half.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, that's right. And Larry moved in as Nick's Special Assistant. He
                    took my old job with Nick Katzenbach, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile, you had Chip Bohlen in Paris all this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. I should have mentioned, earlier that I worked for Chip Bohlen in
                    Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I thought you probably overlapped with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, and very much so. I was with him for—October '82 until the summer
                    of '83, when I came back. And I should have mentioned that because our two
                    families couldn't have been closer. When he first came, I was there as Special
                    Assistant. Chip didn't know whether he wanted one, and he didn't know me from
                    Adam. Cecil Lyon stayed on as DCM, and told him: “Look. Use Bob. He'll be fine.
                    You'll like him.</p>
                <p>One thing I had to do for General Gavin, was to draft his telegrams of meetings
                    with de Gaulle, Couve de Murville, and others. He would come back, and then
                    unload. In order to have his reports treated in the State Department and
                    elsewhere in Washington, in a logical manner and effective manner, I arranged
                    them subject by subject. It wouldn't, for example, be one telegram of a meeting
                    with de Gaulle on umty-ump subjects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Separate telegrams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Separate telegrams, which Washington liked. So the question was how was
                    this going to be done with Chip Bohlen. You know, he always dictated his own
                    telegrams. He said at the beginning: “I'm not going to have anybody else do that
                    for me.” His drafting was not, frankly, the tightest and cleanest in the world.
                    He was a marvelous conceptual thinker, but tended to wander off on occasion.
                    [Laughter] Eventually, he had me mark over his telegrams. He'd dictate a draft
                    of a meeting, I would separate out the subjects, edit his handiwork. It worked
                    out well. He loved it. The Department liked it.</p>
                <p>One little sidelight, with Chip Bohlen, which—I don't know whether it's part of
                    history. He loved to gamble. Maybe this was well known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew it. He and Tommy always had these high stakes poker
                        games running, which I never played in and wouldn't have thought of playing
                        in. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: In France, of course, Chip had to make his calls on various notables.
                    He couldn't wait to go down to the Midi, to make his official visits. And he
                    always took Avis, his wife, and Elena, my wife, and me with him. The next visit
                    was to Nice and Cannes. While there we went to the casino in Cannes. Avis, his
                    wife, was concerned about this, because she was always concerned about the
                    household budget. She refused to go with him to the casino, but she said to me:
                    “All right, Bob, stay with him and make sure he doesn't over spend.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Off we went to Chemin de Fer. He did pretty well and loved it. I did get him to
                    agree to one thing. I said: “It'll make life a lot easier for both of us, Mr.
                    Ambassador, to lessen the pressure from Mrs. Bohlen. Now, you won this amount of
                    money. Will you please give it to me?”</p>
                <p>“Why do you want it?”</p>
                <p>“Because I'm going to put it in the safe at the embassy and this is going to be
                    your gambling account. When we go out again to gamble, you can use this money
                    without drawing on the household budget. If you keep winning, Mrs. Bohlen won't
                    be so disturbed. So we established “the Bohlen gambling fund,” very discreetly.
                    [Laughter] I'm very sorry I forgot about Chip Bohlen. You must prompt me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're doing great. You don't need much prompting. Well,
                        we're still, I guess, back as country director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. There are two stories I have thought about during that period. One
                    has to do with de Gaulle's withdrawal from the military structure of NATO. You
                    remember the Harmel Plan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vaguely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Pierre Harmel was the Belgian Foreign Minister. And Stevie Davignon was
                    his Cabinet Director. Harmel had been in the States, and was trying to develop a
                    plan whereby the 14 allies (minus France) could have a doctrine to operate in
                    light of the acts France had taken. We had some thoughts to contribute to the
                    Foreign Minister. He was taking the boat back to Europe to draft the doctrine
                    later known as the Harmel Plan.</p>
                <p>Our Assistant Secretary, John Leddy asked me to pass on our thoughts to Harmel in
                    New York before he left for Europe. He was staying at the Pierre Hotel. John
                    didn't give me much notice to get up there, as usual. When I arrived at the
                    Pierre. Harmel and Davignon had just left to catch the ship.</p>
                <p>So I flagged a cab, reached the ship just as fast as I could, got on board, found
                    them, and said: “John Leddy has these thoughts.”</p>
                <p>The Foreign Minister said: “Well, come on. We'll go up in the bar where we can go
                    over them.” When the time came for all visitors ashore, we held the ship, in
                    order to give the Belgian Foreign Minister the United States' views on his plan.
                    I can't remember what the specific points were, but they were important and were
                    included in the plan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The business of consultation is what you don't hear all
                        that much about in the newspapers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. And they were delighted to receive what we had to
                    say.</p>
                <p>Now with your forbearance, I'd like to stop after this because it'll take a
                    little bit of time. This is a trip to Europe I made with Hubert Humphrey, when
                    he was Vice President. It was March 27 to April 10, 1967.</p>
                <p>He'd been asked by the President to go over and focus on two major subjects: one
                    was on the Kennedy Round, which was really in trouble then, and on the
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty, where we weren't at all sure how many backers we were
                    going to get. The trip took us to Geneva, where Mike Blumenthal was our
                    negotiator for the Kennedy Round, and then to Italy, Belgium, Holland, France,
                    London, maybe one or two other places.</p>
                <p>I was asked by John Leddy, four days before the trip, to go with the vice
                    president and help prepare the trip. Unfortunately, Hubert's office was probably
                    about the worst organized office in Washington. He's one of the brightest men I
                    think I've ever met, really and truly; he's absolutely superb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the nicest, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. And his wife was so gracious and thoughtful. Ted Van Dyke, who is
                    also bright, was his foreign affairs fellow. He and I got along like a house
                    afire. They couldn't organize themselves. So I was sent over to see the Vice
                    President, who'd never seen me before, and his staff. We managed to pull
                    together all the briefing papers. John Leddy told his Bureau: “Turn yourselves
                    inside out. We're going to get this thing done right.” And we prepared a
                    wonderful briefing book. Excellent oral briefings were given to the Vice
                    President, two or three days before he left.</p>
                <p>The trip was a very successful one from his point of view. And I think that Ted
                    and I contributed to it, somewhat, by making sure that every single day a
                    telegram was sent from Hubert Humphrey to the President of the United States on
                    what went on. We held very systematic briefings for the press, which had never
                    been done before. Some press people came on the plane with us. Before we'd go
                    into each capital, we would brief them on the plane. I had to do much of this.
                    It's the first time I ever really started to deal with the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this how you got your experience for your later
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, I guess so. But in Rome—and you can understand this—Hubert was
                    tied up in a meeting with the President of Italy, and he was supposed to give a
                    press conference. The press was there waiting; they waited 15 minutes, a half
                    hour, one hour—no Humphrey. With their deadlines coming up, they were becoming
                    very, very unhappy. I rushed from the meeting to brief the press. They seemed
                    satisfied, and rushed off to file their stories.Frank Meloy, God love him, who
                    was our minister in Rome at that time, wrote an unbelievable letter back here to
                    somebody about my impromptu briefing of the press. Frank, you may remember, was
                    murdered in Beirut where he was serving as our Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had just finished your press conference in Rome,
                        with the Humphrey trip. Do you want to pick up from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. The next morning before we took off for Florence and then on to
                    see Foreign Minister Luns in The Hague, Ted Van Dyke came running into my
                    bedroom and said: “The Vice President wants to see you immediately.”</p>
                <p>I said to myself: “Oh, God, what now?”</p>
                <p>He said: “Down there.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Well, come on with me.”</p>
                <p>He said: “No, no, no. I'm not coming. There's a problem.”</p>
                <p>I said: “You're his man.”</p>
                <p>Ted replied: “No, he wants to see you.”</p>
                <p>I walked into the bedroom, and Mrs. Humphrey was there, and she said: “Good
                    morning, Bob.” I thought I'd done something; I didn't know what was going on.
                    Well, “The Vice President's in there. He wants to see you.” “There” was in the
                    bathroom! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like Lyndon Johnson. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I walked in, and there was the Vice President of the United States,
                    stark naked, standing in front of the mirror, shaving, and fuming! And I said:
                    “Good morning, Mr. Vice President.”</p>
                <p>“Good morning, Bob.” And he said: “I want you to get rid of that guy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I asked: “Whom are you talking about?</p>
                <p>“That State Department guy. He was criticizing me and telling everybody last
                    night, over drinks, that I'm a fool.”I said: “What?” And I found out that it was
                    a State Department officer, and that in fact, he had been critical. He was just
                    too young and immature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was somebody in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, he came with us from Washington to handle communications and
                    telegrams. So I talked to this fellow, who was very remorseful. But I said:
                    “There's no question. You're leaving.” And I had to get somebody else flown out
                    from Washington. I called Ben Read, who was the Executive Secretary of the
                    Department, to find a replacement.</p>
                <p>When I told the Vice President, he said: “I never want to see him again.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Yes, Mr. Vice President, I will get somebody else from Washington, but
                    until he gets here, this gentleman's services are absolutely necessary, or else
                    you're not going to get have telegrams in or out, or anything; his presence is
                    very necessary.”</p>
                <p>“I never want to see him again.”</p>
                <p>“You won't see him, I promise you.” So I kept him out of sight until we had the
                    new person on board. [Laughter]His meeting in The Hague, with Foreign Minister
                    Luns, was a remarkable performance, I thought, if you want to talk about the
                    power of persuasion of Hubert Humphrey. Luns had been Foreign Minister, for many
                    years. I guess Genscher, the German Foreign Minister, has now broken his record,
                    but up until that time, Luns was the longest serving Foreign Minister since
                    World War II. Luns and his people were on one side of the table; the Vice
                    President and his staff on the other side. The Vice President started talking
                    about the highly sexy subjects of the Kennedy Round and the Non-Proliferation
                    Treaty. It's pretty difficult to stir emotions on those subjects, I think. He
                    had Luns with tears coming out of his eyes before the end of that meeting, as
                    well as gaining the Dutch vote for the NPT. I have never seen such a
                    performance. He was absolutely superb.</p>
                <p>The end of the Humphrey story and this trip is rather interesting. We were
                    supposed to get back on April 9, 1967, which was a Sunday. Suddenly the word
                    came from the President: “Delay your return until Monday, because I want to have
                    a formal welcoming ceremony on the south lawn of the White House for you. We're
                    going to helicopter you in. After the ceremony, I'm going to have a Cabinet
                    meeting to hear you report on your trip.”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Hubert nearly died. That reminds me of a story I neglected to tell you earlier.
                    At The Hague, at a lunch with our Ambassador, Bill Tyler, the top Dutch people
                    were there, Hubert launched into one of his favorite subjects— coat of arms of
                    the Vice President. He described the President's coat of arms with it arrows and
                    compared it go his which has only one. Hubert then stood up gesticulated and
                    waving his imaginary arrow said: “But with this one arrow I can take care of him
                    or anybody else. You don't have to worry. I can protect myself.” [Laughter] He
                    had the entire Dutch Government in stitches.</p>
                <p>To return to the trip home—we had an extra day; it was a Sunday. This was the end
                    of the trip, and we were exhausted, I can tell you. But when we received this
                    news, I suggested we have the Vice President's written report of his whole trip
                    before landing in Washington, so that he could present it at the Cabinet
                    meeting. Ted Van Dyke and I were in our respective bedrooms, lying down and
                    totally exhausted. We had batteries of secretaries coming into our rooms and
                    dictated the various pieces of it, and then shifting it to his room and my room
                    and back and forth. We completed the final draft of the report of the Vice
                    President's trip to Europe, with the background, summary of meetings, and
                    specific recommendations for Presidential action. There were 23 of them.</p>
                <p>At one point I said to Ted: “Somehow we must have the report in a presentable
                    form to give to the President.” So we scrounged on the airplane going back. We
                    cut out gold lettering, and did all sorts of things to come up with a beautiful
                    binder done for the report.</p>
                <p>We landed, helicoptered to the south lawn and began the Cabinet meeting with the
                    President on one side of the table, Humphrey on the other with Ted behind him. I
                    passed the finished report to the Vice President, slipping it to him under the
                    table.</p>
                <p>The Vice President he started off, stood up, pulled out this report, and
                    presented it to the President saying: “Mr. President, here is the final report
                    of my trip to Europe, with specific recommendations for your action.” The
                    President was speechless and very pleased.</p>
                <p>The President looked around at his Cabinet: “You see what a Vice President we've
                    got here.” Without looking he added: “I want all these recommendations
                    implemented right away.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>It made Hubert look like a winner. On previous trips abroad, written reports were
                    never done. But this time he had his first written report, and was able to
                    present it to the President an hour after we touched down. As a result of this
                    experience, he and I became very close. He called for me from time to time to do
                    little chores for him and I tried to help him out. He was an absolutely
                    wonderful human being. I wish, frankly, he had been President of the United
                    States. But that's another question.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: History would have been quite different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. Now the only other thing I'd like to mention just now for a minute
                    is the student riots in France in May, '68. It's the only time I ever had a
                    difference of view with Chip Bohlen. I was the Country Director for
                    France/Benelux, and the point man on that whole subject as far as the European
                    Bureau was concerned.</p>
                <p>When de Gaulle left the Elys�e nobody knew where he was going. The President was
                    in Texas. Dean Rusk was home under the weather—I think it was the only time he
                    was not in the State Department in eight years. Nick Katzenbach, the Under
                    Secretary, was in Texas with the President. The president was going to have a
                    press conference. Larry Eagleburger and I were in my old office, in Katzenbach's
                    Suite, where I used to be with George Ball. Larry was Nick's Special Assistant.
                    We did up the press guidance for the President to use in Texas, and phoned it
                    down to Nick, and the President subsequently used it.</p>
                <p>I can't remember where Chip was, and whether he was back as Under Secretary for
                    political affairs or whether he was still in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in Paris until sometime in '68, but I don't
                        know—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. Then Shriver—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, yes, February, '68 he left Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Okay. Well, then he was back in Washington. I talked with him about de
                    Gaulle's mysterious departure from Paris. Chip said he felt that de Gaulle had
                    given up, and would resign. That's the only time I ever took issue with him. I
                    said: “That does not sound like General de Gaulle; he just wouldn't do that.
                    He's up to something. He'll be back. Something's going to happen.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I've forgotten this entirely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, he went to see General Massu, who was the Commander of the French
                    forces in Germany. What he wanted to do was to make sure that Massu was going to
                    stand behind him; because you remember, at the time of Algeria Massu was not
                    exactly a de Gaulle supporter. So that's what he was up to. That was the one
                    time Chip and I didn't agree on something, and I happened to be right on that
                    particular one.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I don't know why Chip felt that, because that was so unlike de Gaulle, you know,
                    to just quit and go off to Colomb� les Deux Eglises.</p>
                <p>[End of March 12, 1990 interview. Beginning of interview on March 26, 1990.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Anderson, we're glad to continue your
                        interview. When we left off, you had just, I think, finished your assignment
                        in Washington as—or towards the end of your assignment in Washington—as
                        Country Director for France/Benelux. Do you want to pick up there, or would
                        you like to go back and fill in some things you may have thought about in
                        the intervening two weeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I would like, Tully, to go back and give you three or four items that
                    are not in chronological order. They might be of interest. One is to go back to
                    Nanking in April, 1949. Johnny Jones, who was our charg� d'affaires, let Tom
                    Cory, who was our Soviet specialist, and me go down to Shanghai for a weekend,
                    because we had been cooped up in Nanking for many, many months and one just
                    didn't know when the communists were going to reach the banks of the Yangtze and
                    finally cross and take over.</p>
                <p>While we were in Shanghai a message came that the communist troops were
                    approaching the Yangtze. Shelling had started. Johnny suggested that it might be
                    helpful if we returned forthwith, because of the reduced size of the embassy,
                    and that it would be rather embarrassing to him and to everyone concerned if two
                    of his officers—both political officers—were not there when the communists took
                    over.</p>
                <p>So a friend of mine took us out to the Lunghua Airport. Virtually all planes were
                    going from north to south, retreating from the communists. Very few were going
                    from south to north; and those that did go from south to north, were empty. We
                    went out on the airstrip, stopped one of these planes, found out it was going to
                    Nanking, and jumped aboard, much to the astonishment of the pilot, who figured
                    that these two young gentlemen must be out of their minds.</p>
                <p>On the way to the airport, we stopped at my wine merchants in Shanghai, Calbert
                    MacGregor, picked up three cases of gin and one case of Roses lime juice, and
                    put them aboard. One might say this was a frivolous act. In actuality, it was a
                    valuable initiative, which we didn't realize at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>After the communists captured us on April 21, 1949, we were not allowed to leave
                    our compound at all, but non-U.S. diplomats and press people—Seymour Topping,
                    for example, from the New York Times, who was then a young stringer—were allowed
                    to come and visit us. So for morale purposes, and to conserve the very limited
                    amount of liquid refreshments that we purchased, the Nanking Volleyball and
                    Gimlet Club was created. You had to play x-number of games of volleyball in
                    order to have one gimlet. There were two or three exceptions. Tommy Davis, the
                    venerable Canadian ambassador, was allowed to have his gimlet every day without
                    playing. But everybody else had to abide by the rules. It was a very valuable
                    morale booster.</p>
                <p>One other point I'd like to mention are two people that worked with George Ball
                    when I was George's special assistant. One is “Soapy” Williams, the ex-governor
                    of Michigan, who was Assistant Secretary for Africa. He had a meeting in
                    George's office one day, and the subject was the possible sale of two submarines
                    to South Africa. Soapy was violently against this, as was his close friend Adlai
                    Stevenson, our U.N. representative in New York. They felt that this would enable
                    South Africa to reinforce its apartheid policy.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, George Ball had a different view, as did I. We somehow or other
                    failed to see how two submarines could be used in a military way to enforce
                    apartheid, going down the main street of Johannesburg, or what; we just couldn't
                    fathom this. But psychologically and politically, Soapy and Stevenson felt, that
                    because of Third World reaction this would be an unfortunate move. George
                    withdrew his objections and didn't block it.</p>
                <p>The net result was the French made $40,000,000 on the sale of two submarines
                    immediately, and we lost $40,000,000. It didn't strengthen or weaken apartheid
                    one iota.</p>
                <p>Another gentleman I'd like to make a brief comment about is Averell Harriman, who
                    was, as I recall, negotiating on Indochina in Geneva. An issue came up, and he
                    wanted to take a certain position. George Ball did not agree with it. A meeting
                    was held at 9:00 in the morning, in George's office. Averell came, and was in a
                    very sulky mood, as was usually the case when he didn't get his own way. He sat
                    on the couch and Mr. Ball began making his points. There was no reaction
                    whatsoever from Averell. Finally—I don't know whether George Springsteen, his
                    senior special assistant, or I might have noticed it. One of us made a motion
                    towards our ear. George Ball screamed out at Averell, “Get your hearing aid. I'm
                    not talking to a wall here.” And he was very, very disturbed about this. So
                    Averell's special assistant had to leave the meeting and later come back with
                    the hearing aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>One other out-of-chronological-order subject has to do with Henry Ford. This was
                    when I was still with George Ball, which means it had to be before the summer of
                    '65. Bob Schaetzel was a deputy-assistant secretary in EUR, and very much a
                    European unity man, as we all know. He was hoping that the British could begin
                    talks, at some point, to join the Common Market, following General de Gaulle's
                    veto in January, 1963. There was very serious problems with the economy in
                    England; it just wasn't working. All the indices were down. The prospect for
                    successful talks with the Community were therefore not bright. So he invited
                    Henry Ford, who had extensive interests in England, to come to Washington to
                    chat with us about the economy. He asked Henry: “What can be done in England?
                    You have extensive interests there. You must have some ideas.”</p>
                <p>Ford was very clear; he laughed, shrugged his shoulders, looked at us and he
                    said: “There's just one thing the British have to do if they want to improve
                    their economy. They have to go to work. They don't like to work. British
                    executives are the greatest weekenders in history. Most of them may work a
                    four-day week at the most, except for a few CEOs, who work quite hard. The power
                    of the labor unions has caused a disastrous situation. I have my own troubles
                    over there.” We can see from this why Mrs. Thatcher went after the labor unions
                    as her main target to cure Britain's economic ills.</p>
                <p>Now we go to 1968, in the summer, when I finished up as the country director for
                    France and the Benelux. Incidentally, I might make a comment about Dean Rusk,
                    who invented the country director system. And I've always admired him
                    tremendously. I guess Dean Acheson is my first hero, and Dean Rusk my second
                    one. He was an unsung hero as a secretary of state in our country. I saw him in
                    action frequently..Four or five days a week, I was with him in George Ball's
                    office, or in his own office, as the two principals worked together. I think I
                    mentioned in one of my earlier tapes their excellent relationship.</p>
                <p>The country director system was one that I wish existed today because it helped
                    streamline the decision-making operation of the State Department. It put it down
                    at a level where it should be. It was sufficiently high if you had the right
                    people at the country director level (that's the old office-director level, and
                    I guess it's now, again, the office director level). You cut out a number of the
                    channels between the country director and the secretary of state. Before, you'd
                    have to have so many clearances on virtually every telegram. Many of these
                    telegrams could be cleared and sent out at the country director level, therefore
                    freeing the higher-ups to concentrate more on policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, in an earlier conversation we had, you were
                        talking also about a relationship with Rusk and his visit to de Gaulle, in
                        which you and Ed Beigel did a special...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Thank you for reminding me of that. This was in the spring of '66,
                    right after General de Gaulle withdrew from the military-structure of NATO,
                    which obviously concerned not only us, but the other allies. People really
                    didn't understand a lot of the things going on in this man's mind. A fantastic
                    book, called La Tragedie du General, by a Jean Raymond Tournoux, was published.
                    It was a very thick tome, carefully researched, and its contents never denied by
                    de Gaulle. It was essentially a book of quotations by de Gaulle, of his private
                    and public pronouncements. Most of them were private.</p>
                <p>Ed Beigel and I sat up for four nights, just before Secretary Rusk was taking off
                    for the spring NATO ministerial in Paris. We thought that selecting different
                    quotes of de Gaulle might give a better feel of who this man was; what was
                    making him tick. It was about a 25-page paper that we came up with which we
                    finished just before the Secretary boarded his plane.</p>
                <p>He sent word back, actually, from the plane, saying, “This is great. I'm learning
                    things.” He made the staff travelling with him read it, then later gave a copy
                    to each allied foreign minister, before the NATO ministerial started, suggesting
                    they might want to read it. Anybody who's seriously interested in trying to
                    understand General de Gaulle ought to get this book and study it. Our language
                    people could probably have done a hell of a lot better job than Ed and I did,
                    but time was of the essence. We both felt this was a modest contribution to
                    trying to figure out what was going on in General de Gaulle's mind.</p>
                <p>The summer of '68, I returned to Paris this time, as political counselor. Sarge
                    Shriver asked me to join him as one of a number of changes he wished to make in
                    the embassy in reorienting our activities in France.</p>
                <p>Sarge Shriver, in my view, was the right man at the right time having come there
                    during the events of the summer of '68 after which General de Gaulle would never
                    be the same again. For example, he finally realized that he could not contain
                    Germany by himself. This led to the very private luncheon with Sir Christopher
                    Soames, the British ambassador in Paris, where de Gaulle threw out, for the
                    first time, the desirability of maybe reinstituting talks to have the United
                    Kingdom enter the Common Market. (The British leaked this. I don't blame them
                    for leaking it after de Gaulle's veto in January, 1963. They wanted to make sure
                    he wasn't going once again to play games with them.)</p>
                <p>De Gaulle was infuriated that this luncheon leaked in London. The actual
                    negotiations for the entry of Great Britain into the Common Market did not start
                    until Pompidou succeeded de Gaulle as president. Nevertheless, de Gaulle
                    realized that Germany could not be contained, and that maybe the United Kingdom
                    was just about as anti-supranational as France. In my own view, I think the
                    British are more anti-supranational than France, if you think of what's going on
                    today in the Common Market.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>That being said: I wanted to make a couple of points about how Sarge Shriver
                    reoriented the embassy. He was very imaginative, and totally dedicated. He had
                    more ideas per minute than any man I've ever met. He might have ten ideas. Eight
                    of them might questionable, but one or two might be superb, and that's great. He
                    was one of the more stimulating personalities I've ever worked with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem on the ideas that weren't good,
                        quieting him down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Absolutely not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Just did them anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No. He would knock some of his own ideas down himself. One of the
                    things that we did at the very beginning of Sarge's stay had to do with your
                    favorite sport, tennis. At that time, we were trying to build up a respectable
                    Davis Cup team. We'd been in a disastrous situation for four or five years.
                    Donald Dell, Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Charlie Pasarell and Bob Lutz were the top
                    candidates for the Cup team. They came over to France, and we arranged a
                    month-long tour throughout France.</p>
                <p>Those of us in the embassy who spoke fluent French went with them to various
                    cities where we'd speak at lunches and dinners and help them out. Needless to
                    say, I volunteered not only because of my love of tennis, but because of the new
                    French friends I found in the provinces.</p>
                <p>They did a wonderful job, and were tremendous ambassadors of the United States in
                    the provinces where there had been virtually no contact with Americans since
                    1958 when de Gaulle came to power. That's the way he wanted it in order to try
                    and give the French people self-respect again. With the Americans all over
                    France in different bases, what he wanted to do was to reduce the French
                    thinking about the United States and Americans, and have them start to think
                    about themselves.</p>
                <p>I can't fault him on that, frankly. He did succeed in having the Frenchman regain
                    confidence in himself. I think that was a vital necessity if France was going to
                    continue as a world power, or even an important regional power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were also having some military conversations, weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Military conversations started before Sarge Shriver arrived in France,
                    and continued between General Lemnitzer, who was the SACEUR, and General
                    Ailleret, who was the equivalent of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                    for France. They worked out very confidential arrangements of cooperation
                    between NATO and France in case of a conflict. If France decided to enter a
                    conflict, certain things would happen. But the French insisted—and this is the
                    main point always at issue—that they were going to decide unilaterally if they
                    were going to enter the conflict.</p>
                <p>If this had been made public, de Gaulle would have complained and nothing would
                    have been done. I think we always have to remember that with our French friends
                    military-to-military relationships have always been easier and more productive
                    than political relationships which really is quite understandable because
                    usually military-to-military relationships, many of which are contingencies, are
                    not cast over the front pages of the newspapers as are political
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>Another wonderful program in the embassy was our youth program. I had a youth
                    officer assigned to the political section and gave part of the section's
                    representation allowance to the officer to use as he or she saw fit.</p>
                <p>One program we started was an exchange of French Parliamentarians and U.S.
                    Congressmen under 40 years of age. For the first exchange about ten American
                    congressmen and their wives came to France and spent a week or ten days, if you
                    can believe it. We had excellent meetings in Paris and out into the
                    constituencies of their French counterparts. The next year, the same French
                    Deput�s came over with their wives to America. A similar program was arranged in
                    Washington, and then they in the constituencies of their U.S. hosts. The speaker
                    of the House of Representatives today, Tom Foley, was one of these people.
                    Because of this experience, Tom thinks that the French are absolutely fantastic.
                    And Don Beigle, then a Republican congressman and now a Democratic Senator from
                    Michigan, was another participant. We had some very wonderful people in this
                    program who came to appreciate France and made their judgments based on
                    knowledge of the country and its people, not on the misinformed, emotional
                    reactions we so often see.</p>
                <p>Something happened in this program for which I was almost thrown out of France by
                    some senior Gaullist Deput�s who were friends of mine. The young French deput�s,
                    who came over and went up to Capitol Hill. When they saw the facilities that our
                    congressmen have, such as separate offices, separate telephones, and staffs,
                    their eyes bulged. In Paris, when I was there, the French Deput�s had to line up
                    to use about three or four phones in one large salon in the Parliament building.
                    It was very beautiful with gold and red damask curtains, but not very practical
                    as they didn't have separate offices or separate staffs.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I would like you to know that today there is a separate building and each member
                    of the French Parliament has his or her own office and staff, as a result of the
                    first visit of the young Deput�s to Washington in the late 1960s.</p>
                <p>Some of the old codgers, some of my friends who were in the Parliament then, like
                    General Pierre Billotte, for example said: “You are trying to ruin this country.
                    We can't afford this. These young people don't need all of these facilities. I
                    didn't ever have them when I was a deput� for 20 years.”</p>
                <p>I said: “General, I'm sorry. I don't agree with you; they can do a better job
                    this way.” Every time I go to Paris some of my friends take me over there, as
                    they consider it a small memorial that I gave them. It's right behind Quai
                    d'Orsay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Hardly.</p>
                <p>Another thing that we started—this started, actually, before I went there with
                    Shriver, but we built on it a little bit. When I came back to join George Ball
                    in 1963, I was concerned over the lack of people at senior levels who really
                    knew anything about France. We had difficulties getting the ideal number twos,
                    political counselors (Randy Kidder was an exception) and economic ministers.</p>
                <p>I talked this over with Chip Bohlen and he said: “What we've got to do is build
                    up a cadre of people who gain experience in France at an early age, and know
                    something about France, so that later on the personnel system can dip into the
                    files and find a DCM that at least speaks fluent French.” It was unbelievable
                    the lack of senior people who had any real background on France, and it's this
                    way today, not quite as bad, but almost. So what did we try and do?</p>
                <p>George Ball got behind this, along with Bill Crockett, who was the number-one
                    administrator of the Department at the time Ball was Under Secretary. We
                    arranged with the �cole National d'Administration (ENA), which is the elite
                    graduate school formed after the war by Pierre Racine, from which any person
                    aspiring to enter public service had to graduate, to allocate one slot for an
                    American diplomat to go there. And Crockett funded it. It was a one-year
                    program. The point was that we wanted a bright, young FSO already fluent in
                    French to go there and absorb France and things French along side the future
                    leaders of France. I think of the contacts he'd make.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The next step, following one year at ENA, was going to be to assign the
                    class-four or five FSO as Principal Officer at one of our Consulates in France
                    for two years. In this way, we could find out if he could run an office. Put him
                    in Lyon as consul general; if he can't run anything, it doesn't matter anyway,
                    because it's not going to break the bank. Peter Tarnoff was our first man. I
                    just wish he was still in the Service, because he could have been the DCM, and
                    eventually our ambassador to France. He was superb. He went through ENA, and was
                    an excellent consul general in Lyon. The system has not continued the way we
                    wanted it to. It did for four of five years. But this was the idea that we
                    wanted to have work out, so a higher caliber of people who understand France
                    could be available to fill the key jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strangely enough, your friend Johnny Jones built up a very
                        similar system in Italy, which was functioning when I was young. It's
                        totally destroyed now because of this business of bidding for jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: This is a pity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is too bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: In recent years we failed to send students to ENA as the State
                    Department says we don't have money. Well, this is inexcusable. For example, the
                    Germans send 40 students every year. Now you think, this has been going on since
                    World War II, practically; think of the number of Germans that are close to the
                    number of French. And at the level they are now, they're Ministers, bank
                    presidents and corporation heads. They pick up the phone, the old-boys club
                    starts to operate. De Gaulle wanted to have this done as another way to try and
                    prevent France and Germany from being at loggerheads. I think it was a wonderful
                    initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frenchmen would go to Germany, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I don't think the Germans have an ENA, but there are French students
                    who attend other institutions. To continue on with ENA for a minute, which we
                    built on when Sarge Shriver was in Paris. We instituted a graduation present for
                    six students from ENA, to come to the United States after they graduated. They
                    could come for six weeks and visit anyplace they wanted. It was separate from
                    the Leader grant program, but the same idea. We did this for a few years, and
                    then formed an alumni association, so we could stay in touch with these ENA
                    graduates as they moved through their careers. This was an extremely valuable
                    contact for the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Henri Alphand was French ambassador here, and went back as Secretary General of
                    the foreign office. He never was pro-American, and managed to change with the
                    political climate throughout his career. Charles Lucat, his successor here, was
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>When Alphand heard about this program, he complained: “Oh, here's the United
                    States trying to subvert these young Frenchmen by offering them a trip.” This
                    actually happened before Shriver arrived in Paris, because I was still back in
                    Washington, and Charles Lucat was Ambassador. Lucat asked me to come over and
                    see him. We had a drink together and he said: “Bob, I've received this telegram,
                    and I don't think we can continue this program.”</p>
                <p>I said: “What? This is ridiculous.”</p>
                <p>He said: “I know.” And he showed me the telegram.</p>
                <p>I said: “Well, what's the problem? Is it because we pay for it?”</p>
                <p>“Well, yes. They think you're bribing these people.”</p>
                <p>I said: “All right, Charles, do you agree this is a good program?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>I then commented: “I think, too, it's wonderful. It helps U.S.-French relations.
                    So you pay for it. But still let them come. Don't deprive them of this
                    experience, after they've gone through this terribly rigorous course.” And that
                    is what happened. So we were able to continue it and the French paid for it. We
                    overcame Alphand's objection, because we weren't paying for it.</p>
                <p>To return to one thing I said on our efforts to try to understand France more, to
                    have officers develop more contacts with the French people in this new
                    atmosphere that I described earlier. We instituted a program, whereby in the
                    Paris consulate district, the members of the political and economic section had
                    to visit specific parts of the district four times a year.</p>
                <p>I never heard such bleats out of some members of the political section, all of
                    whom are ambassadors now. That was one of the most star-studded sections in
                    history; Mike Glitman, who just completed the TNF Treaty negotiations; John
                    Gunther Dean; Andy Steigman; and Bob Oakley. We had a whole stable of them. They
                    started to gripe about getting out into the countryside in a staff meeting,
                    saying: “But look at the telegrams that are coming in my in-box.”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I said: “Gentlemen, I couldn't care less about your in-box or your telegrams. You
                    are to go out. You're going to learn something about this country. Paris is not
                    France. You're going meet mayors. You're going to meet members of Parliament out
                    in the provinces. You're going to meet chambers of commerce leaders. I want you
                    to learn about France and profit from this.” They really were unhappy with me.
                    And I said: “If you don't, it's going to be reflected in your fitness report.
                    I'm sorry.” I was very, very disturbed by their narrow view.</p>
                <p>The long and the short of this story is that after they went twice, I couldn't
                    keep them in the office. They loved it. They later came and thanked me, and
                    said: “We now know something about France.”</p>
                <p>And that reminds me of one thing. When I arrived in Paris on August 15, 1968,
                    Perry Culley, my dear, wonderful friend, was Consul General. He met me at the
                    train station, because I brought my family over by boat and took the train from
                    Le Havre. I had had no vacation, and those five days were going to be my leave.
                    We drove to the front gate of the embassy, and Perry said: “Bob, I'm afraid you
                    have to go into the embassy right now.” I wasn't even allowed to go home and
                    drop my family off at the residence, where Randy Kidder lived—you know, the
                    house with the elevator at Leopold II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: My three children and wife went on with Perry to the house. And I went
                    up and Shriver looked up and said: “It's about time you got here.”</p>
                <p>I said: “What are you saying?”</p>
                <p>“Look, I'm supposed to take off for Sardinia right now, and Eunice and the
                    children are waiting. I've got to go. Good luck.” He took off one hour later,
                    and left me virtually in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Woody Wallner had just left ahead of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Woody was there, but winding up as DCM. Ten days later, the Russians
                    went into Czechoslovakia, and I was there in the embassy with Shriver in
                    Sardinia, and Woody's replacement not yet in place.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>One of the first things we did was to reduce the political reporting of the
                    American Embassy by 60%. I had been on the receiving end in Washington earlier,
                    and the quantity of telegrams was overwhelming. As often happens, and you know
                    this as well as I do, our political sections like to compete with the
                    newspapers. Newspapers are paid to get the scoops ASAP. We're paid to analyze. I
                    did not want to try and beat the wire services with some minor scoop.
                    Eliminating this type of marginal reporting enabled us to devote more time to go
                    out into the country, to learn more about France and to develop new objectives
                    to improve our relations with France.</p>
                <p>There was a cost-cutting effort to close USIS offices in the provinces and
                    operate only out of Paris. We fought that and won, because the USIS offices in
                    France, for the first time now, were going to be able to have some effective
                    contact with the French people. We therefore didn't want to lose this tool.</p>
                <p>There are a couple of amusing stories about Sarge and Eunice Shriver. One had to
                    do with a stag lunch at the residence—the old residence at Number Two Avenue
                    Iena. There were about ten of us. One thing that you would never know as you
                    went into the residence was where the dining table was going to be. It was like
                    a floating crap table; it moved into different rooms, depending upon what the
                    children were doing. There were usually no rugs on the floor because they would
                    impede the mobility of the fire engines, the bicycles and the tricycles.</p>
                <p>Two French Cabinet ministers came on this particular day. One was a very
                    dignified, senior Gaullist minister, who always wore a bow tie, he was sitting
                    at Sarge's right. One of the Shriver children came in. I was at an angle where I
                    could see the child, I think it was Anthony. As he came in through the door, I
                    watched his eyes. They were focused on the bow tie of the French minister. He
                    came towards the French minister, and his right hand started to go up. I broke
                    into the conversation, and I said: “Mr. Ambassador, Anthony's on your right. Get
                    his arm, quickly.” Sarge saved the day, and the bow tie of the Minister remained
                    tied. [Laughter] That's just one little example.</p>
                <p>Another story involves Eunice. She had very definite views on the people she'd
                    like to sit with at dinners. A very large, important dinner was scheduled. Couve
                    de Murville, the Foreign Minister, was going to be there. And Alphand had come
                    back from Washington—no, at that time he was already the Secretary General of
                    the foreign office. And then Arthur Ashe would be there along with other tennis
                    people. It was a large dinner with a number of round tables in different
                    rooms.</p>
                <p>Eunice asked my dear wife, Elena, if she would come over and arrange the seating
                    because she didn't have much confidence in the lady that was hired to do this
                    sort of thing. So Elena did the job and came home to change for the big event.
                    This was one of the few black-tie affairs the Shrivers had. As a matter of fact,
                    Jackie Kennedy was there with her sister. It was quite an evening.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>We returned to the Residence and walked in a little ahead of time. And there was
                    Eunice moving the place cards Elena arranged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In France, of all places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I know. She wanted Arthur Ashe and other friends at her table, not
                    Couve de Murville, the Foreign Minister. And she started to put Couve, the
                    Foreign Minister, someplace. Alphand, who had been placed in the outer regions,
                    nearly walked out.</p>
                <p>Elena and I finally persuaded Eunice to place Couve at the number one table, but
                    lost on most other counts. This is the way they were. Sometimes they'd get away
                    with it, sometimes they wouldn't.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, a little vignette on Couve de Murville, that comes to mind. It
                    involves Sir Harold Nicholson, whom you know?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, Couve de Murville has an Anglophobia the likes of which I've
                    never seen. I'll never forget, for example, after de Gaulle pulled out of the
                    military structure of NATO, there was a U.N. session in New York and Dean Rusk
                    invited Couve and the French delegation, as we always did, to a small bilateral
                    lunch up at the Waldorf Astoria apartment of our Ambassador. Couve refused to
                    speak English; he wouldn't use one word of impeccable English. He just sat
                    there, sulked and spoke French, and insisted that it be translated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I've heard Alphand will do this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I found out one reason that he's this way. It involves Sir Harold
                    Nicholson, and it's a true story. When Couve was a young man, Sir Harold wanted
                    to have a tennis professional, somebody to come and teach his children tennis.
                    Couve saw the ad Sir Harold placed in the papers. He was accepted and went to
                    Sir Harold Nicholson's to teach tennis and be a companion to the children. He
                    was treated like a servant. He was not considered part of the family, and had a
                    room out in back. Couve never forgot this. This may be an important little
                    footnote to history that explains, in part why Couve feels the way he does about
                    the English. I thought that this might be interesting for somebody to check into
                    this further if one wanted to.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I believe I mentioned to you about Jacques Chaban-Delmas who was Prime Minister
                    when Sarge Shriver was there. I told you before I had become very close to him
                    starting in 1959 when he was Mayor of Bordeaux. I used to see him often as Prime
                    Minister, always of course with Sarge's prior approval. He was delighted to have
                    me see Chaban. I would usually be asked to come to the Matignon, where the prime
                    minister had his office, and would go up the back stairs to see him, whenever he
                    had something he wanted to discuss.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget when France sold a number of Mirage aircraft to Libya back in
                    '68 or '69. And you know, we were concerned about this. I went to see Chaban, at
                    his request, and as far as I know, this has never been written. But he said:
                    “Bob, look, please tell your people not to be so worried about this. They can't
                    fly them. We are going to train their pilots. That's going to be in Dijon,
                    France. It's going to take a long time, number one. And number two, they're not
                    really going to ever be able to really fly them. I don't think they will ever
                    become a military factor. And through this, a sale of 100 Mirages, we may be
                    able to exert some political leverage on Libya.”</p>
                <p>This is so typically French. That is what he told me, and I reported it to
                    Washington. I must say, Washington's temperature lowered. I haven't followed the
                    entire history of the 100 aircraft—but as far as I know, they have never became
                    a potent military factor for Libya.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't seem to prevent our bombing [Qadhafi] some
                        years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I agree, but I don't know if any of those aircraft are still
                    operational, because that's a long ago. They bought them in '68 or '69.</p>
                <p>One other tidbit about Chaban-Delmas, when my wife and I were transferred—this
                    jumps up to 1972 when I was going to Africa as Ambassador to Dahomey. I wanted
                    to pay a farewell call on him. And so he and his wife invited Elena and me to
                    his private apartments at the Matignon. The four of us were there alone
                    together. He was thinking about running for the Presidency then, but his new
                    wife didn't want to have anything to do with it; she was the sporting type and
                    just wanted to return to her life in the southwest. And I was trying to find out
                    his future plans, and asked: “Well, you've been prime minister now for quite a
                    while. How much longer are you going to be here?”</p>
                <p>He said: “Yes, I have been. Let's see.” He looked up at the calendar on the wall,
                    that had Xs marked for each day. He continued: “I've been here for X years, X
                    months, and 16 hours.” [Laughter] He looked at his watch, and said: “I can't
                    wait to get out. Really.”</p>
                <p>His dear wife, whom I saw a couple of months ago here, had told him: “You'd
                    better just move on.” But she did let him make a run at the Presidency. Giscard
                    d'Estaing did not play fair on this one. He falsely accused Chaban of not paying
                    his income tax, which just wasn't correct. That eliminated him as a
                    contender.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is he still mayor of Bordeaux?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, and still a member of parliament. Michel Jobert. I might say one
                    brief word about him. He was subsequently Foreign Minister, but under Pompidou,
                    he was the secretary general of the Presidency. I came to know him well.</p>
                <p>He was born in Morocco. He has an American wife. The son went to the American
                    school, very bright. Yet, he never really liked the United States that much. I
                    think one of the things that became a little difficult was his relations with
                    Henry Kissinger, who was then in the White House. They both had strong
                    personalities, and just couldn't get along very well. I've seen Jobert many
                    times since, and he still has a chip on his shoulder, as far as we're concerned;
                    I don't think that will ever leave.</p>
                <p>I remember once he called me over to the Elys�e. He said: “The President is very
                    upset by this Newsweek article. Why did you all do this? You didn't tell us this
                    was your policy.”</p>
                <p>I found it amazing that a man of his intelligence, and Pompidou's intelligence,
                    could focus on a Newsweek article, and consider it was American policy. But that
                    happened so often. I just had to tell him: “You can tell your President that
                    that is not our policy. We told you what it was last week. And just because
                    Newsweek writes something different, it, doesn't mean our policy has
                    changed.”</p>
                <p>And then an amazing thing was that he had all the secrets of the state on his
                    desk, and said: “Fine. I'll go in and tell him.” He left me sitting there alone
                    with all the papers, commenting as he went in to calm Pompidou down: “He's
                    really angry.” He's angry at you, too.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Well, don't be angry at me; I didn't have anything to do with this. And
                    ask him not to become so upset by Newsweek.”</p>
                <p>One item, to do with President Nixon's visit, when Sarge Shriver was Ambassador,
                    and General Walters was our Defense Attach�. There was a beautiful dinner at the
                    Elys�e palace, that de Gaulle gave for President Nixon. General Walters was the
                    translator for the toasts. When de Gaulle spoke, Walters stood behind President
                    Nixon and did the translation. Then when Nixon spoke, Walters translated Nixon's
                    toast into French. There was a slight difficulty here. General Walters became so
                    enthralled with what de Gaulle and Nixon had to say that his rendition of what
                    was said was horribly translated.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Henri Alphand and I were sitting near the end of the table and we looked at each
                    other and there was the press and everything else. And we said: “Wait a minute.
                    Dick's enthusiasm had run away with itself.” We had to rush out and tell the
                    press: “You can use what de Gaulle said in French, and you can use what Nixon
                    said in English, but translations must be reviewed before release.” Dick was
                    such an admirer of General de Gaulle that on that particular evening things just
                    got out of hand a little bit with the dear general. I still consider him one of
                    the most brilliant linguists I have ever known.</p>
                <p>Now, on Sarge Shriver and Nixon. Nixon asked Shriver to stay on as Ambassador,
                    and Sarge accepted. Everybody was pleased with the job he was doing, and he
                    stayed on through '69. Two or three young Democrats then came over and really
                    worked on Shriver to run for the governorship of Maryland in 1970. Much to my
                    disappointment, he succumbed, resigned and went back. The reason that I'm even
                    more disappointed is, that these young Democrats hadn't done their homework
                    properly. By the time he returned to Maryland, he was too late to register, and
                    couldn't even run for the governorship.</p>
                <p>So he resigned as Ambassador of France and couldn't run as governor for Maryland.
                    I have been very disappointed in that because I think he would have been a
                    tremendous asset to stay on there, rather than have poor Dick Watson represent
                    us, because Dick was a—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Man of complexes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He was a very sick man. He had a terrible alcohol problem, as we all
                    know. And it finally did him in. I was very close to him. I can't say too much
                    about distinguished things that happened while he was there. I think the main
                    thing is we were able to persuade the French to cooperate with us on narcotics.
                    Dick worked the Interior Minister, who at first didn't want to have anything to
                    do with it, saying: “That's your problem, not ours.”</p>
                <p>But we persuaded our French friends, including President Pompidou, that this was,
                    indeed, going to be a French problem, and it was going to affect their youth.
                    You may remember the movies, French Connection I and French Connection II.
                    French Connection I was a direct result of the cooperation we worked out with
                    the French and illustrates the depth of our cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who, by this time, was your DCM there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Watson wanted a change immediately. Perry Culley came back this time as
                    DCM. His background was more consular and administrative. Perry and I couldn't
                    have been closer, and had worked well together previously. Perry was the one
                    Dick Watson wanted when told by the Service that I couldn't move up from
                    political counselor to DCM. John Burns, who was Director General of the Foreign
                    Service, and a good friend, said: “That's something we don't like to do, if we
                    can avoid it.” I wasn't that senior then, and that was fine, because I loved my
                    job as political counselor and knew I would enjoy working with Watson and
                    Perry.</p>
                <p>In any event, I went down to Cotonou, the capital of Dahomey, in March '72. It
                    was just as well that I left Dick because three months later, he was out anyway,
                    after press reports of his stuffing $100 bills down Pan Am hostesses bosoms. It
                    was an election year and an unhappy Nixon let him stay for a brief period and
                    then replaced him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Irwin replaced him, as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, Jack Irwin, Dick's brother-in-law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, Dick's brother-in-law, and also IBM. So
                        IBM-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, they had a lock on it. My assignment to Dahomey, which was one of
                    the 26 poorest countries in the world, was a fantastic experience for the two
                    years I was there. I set three or four objectives; to see if somehow we could
                    help the people of this country—about 2,500,000 at the time—survive and make a
                    go of it. There were, believe it or not, things that could be done economically,
                    and some projects which we developed. But that's all written down in history and
                    it's not that earthshaking.</p>
                <p>But there's one or two points that I do want to make here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went there, Kerekou had not yet made his
                        move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: When I went there, it was a country that had three sitting presidents,
                    which is rather unusual. They were from three different tribes. The agreement
                    was that they would change, peacefully, every six months. The poor French had to
                    pay for three palaces, three sets of cars, three sets of everything. One change
                    did take place, peacefully, while I was there. But then just before the next one
                    was supposed to take place, a military coup occurred and Kerekou took over. As
                    was usually the case with Dahomian coups, no one was killed and virtually no
                    shots were fired.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>One might ask, why does this ridiculous situation of three sitting presidents
                    exist? One of the reasons is certainly to maintain tribal peace. Another reason
                    is that the Dahomians were far and away the most intelligent people in all of
                    West Africa. The French used them to administer French West Africa. Dahomians
                    ran Senegal, for instance. After all these countries, Ivory Coast and the rest
                    of them, became independent, the Senegalese and the Ivorians and others, wanted
                    to run their own countries. They didn't want these Dahomians there. So you had
                    an influx back to little Dahomey of a large number of very intelligent people.
                    What do you do with them? That was another reason that they were creating this
                    three-headed monster. They had to do something with some of these people, and
                    that gave them a few extra jobs, etc.</p>
                <p>Another point I wanted to make here—I'll go into Kerekou in a minute—is the
                    question of how the United States should operate in a Francophone country. When
                    I arrived there—and this holds true for Morocco, too, which I'll discuss
                    later—the French Embassy in Cotonou, was a large, imposing embassy with a well
                    funded Cooperation Mission (the equivalent of our AID), and hundreds of
                    personnel. We had a little, tiny mission with minimal resources. The two sides
                    weren't even speaking to each other. There was constant French suspicion of the
                    United States that we were trying to do something on their turf to undermine
                    them.</p>
                <p>I worked from the outset to changed this. Because of my long experience in
                    France, I knew Jacques Foccart very well. He was “Mr. Africa,” as you may
                    recall, for General de Gaulle in the Elys�e, he was all powerful on anything to
                    do with African policy. Before I went down there, I went and saw him in the
                    Elys�e. Every time I was in Paris, I would call on him and his people; not just
                    those in the Quai d'Orsay, but Foccart in particular. Through Foccart I was
                    given an introduction to the French Ambassador in Cotonou. And eventually became
                    very close to him.</p>
                <p>I made it very, very clear that we were not in Dahomey to try to replace,
                    supplant, or be in competition with the French, but that there might be some
                    things we could help indirectly French policy in economic, social ways. I said
                    it seemed to me the best thing to do was to work together: “I will tell you
                    anything we're thinking about. And I would like your ideas on what we're
                    thinking about before I send my comments back to Washington. Another thing we
                    might think about, Mr. Ambassador is the other nations active here. The Germans
                    and the Swiss have Peace Corps type programs. The Dutch are also here. And the
                    UNDP (United Nations Development Program) are here. Why don't we try and have
                    the U.N. office find out from all of us what aid is being sent to this country,
                    so that we don't duplicate each other, waste funds, and avoid having the
                    Dahomians play one country off against the others?” The French Ambassador liked
                    the idea, and the UNDP instituted the system while I was there.</p>
                <p>And after the coup took place, in late-'74, no late—I got there in '72, I left in
                    April, '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was '73, the fall of—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: The fall of '73, yes. There was another French ambassador there by then
                    and he and I couldn't have worked closer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait a minute. October of '72, pardon me, October,
                        '72.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: You are absolutely correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six months after you got there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. There was one peaceful presidential changeover, and then
                    the military took over. The second French ambassador and I became extremely
                    close. We would see each others, probably four or five days a week. Before I
                    went to see Kerekou, I would check with him and he did the same with me. The
                    confidence we had in each other was total, and certainly served the interests of
                    both our countries.</p>
                <p>I'll jump forward to Morocco now, on this very subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the same problem, but more complicated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, it was more complicated because we had a huge embassy, and the
                    French had a huge embassy. Morocco was French turf. Jean Bernard Raimond arrived
                    as French Ambassador soon after I did. I had worked with him in Paris, when he
                    was Pompidou's diplomatic advisor at the Elys�e; so he was a friend. The two
                    embassies weren't talking to each other when I arrived. There was suspicion with
                    regard to military assistance programs, economic assistance programs, peace
                    corps programs, even to the point of trying to assess the motive of why each of
                    us was in Morocco.</p>
                <p>That was changed dramatically under Jean Bernard, who, incidentally, became
                    Foreign Minister of France under Jacques Chirac when Mitterrand and Chirac
                    formed the two-headed monster of a government before the last election in 1987.
                    I used to see Jean Bernard at the Quai d'Orsay when he was Foreign Minister,
                    every trip I made to Paris. We're still extremely close.</p>
                <p>That's enough on U.S.-French cooperation. But it's important historically. If
                    somebody seriously wants to write something, there are details in the files on
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's very important to have. Well, now I take it,
                        although the record looks as though Kerekou was making a lot of posturings
                        about socialism and communism and so on and so forth, that essentially the
                        relationship with France never changed much under him, or did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, it did, very dramatically. Kerekou was a captain and not that well
                    educated. He was eventually taken over by the leftists no question. While I was
                    still there it was not much of a problem, to be honest with you. But I left with
                    about three weeks' notice, and this really perplexed Kerekou. The French
                    Ambassador later confirmed this to me. He was very upset by this, and thought
                    that my departure signaled a negative reaction of the United States to him. This
                    was before the declaration of a Marxist and Leninist state occurred. That
                    occurred after I left.</p>
                <p>I would go to Kerekou's office three or four days a week. I must say, it was a
                    little harrowing until I got used to it. He had a box of hand grenades by his
                    desk, and assorted arms for his personal protection. I'd have to sit there next
                    to all this armament wondering just how he planned to use it in a small office.
                    He'd ask me to come around and sit next to him to review an economic project.
                    Then he'd call up the appropriate minister and say: “Anderson's here. He
                    suggests that we ought to do this and this. Do it.”</p>
                <p>The French ambassador knew every single thing that I did with Kerekou, in
                    advance. After I would come back, we consulted. And this was a two-way street
                    where there was no suspicion. We were trying to really help Kerekou get an
                    economy moving. But unfortunately, leftist politicians soon took over. He didn't
                    have the intellectual ability to combat them, so they did declare themselves a
                    Marxist-Leninist state, and the country went absolutely down and down and down,
                    economically as well as politically. Our relations were very poor. My successor
                    had a difficult time, and, in fact, had to leave the country precipitously or
                    they might have gotten to him. He did not relate to the Dahomians, and was never
                    really happy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He doesn't seem like the type to me; I know him pretty
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Jim Engle, yes. Jim never should have been sent there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very bright guy, but in a totally different—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was a reward for his Vietnam service. He just shouldn't have been
                    sent there. He had to leave. They considered having me return—except I was
                    Spokesman for the State Department then and couldn't take off to go back—to try
                    and extricate him.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>But nevertheless, there's one little footnote to Kerekou that might be
                    interesting. A year ago November, I received a call from our ambassador in
                    Cotonou, where our relations incidentally are now much, much improved. Our
                    ambassador did a wonderful job there; Walter Stadtler, who is now number two at
                    the Defense University. He called me and said: “I have to see you urgently. I'm
                    coming back to Washington in another week or so.” So I took him to lunch at the
                    club and listened to what he had to say.</p>
                <p>“Bob, you told me how you thought I should deal with Kerekou. I followed your
                    advice, and am now in the position you were, where he talks to me candidly on
                    virtually everything of concern to him.”</p>
                <p>I said: “That's great.”</p>
                <p>Stadtler continued: “What Kerekou wants is help in the United States; he wants to
                    try and improve relations here, obtain some economic help, have his country
                    become better understood. And he wants you to do it. I told Kerekou I would hope
                    you would do it, and agreed to relay his request.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Well, I don't know. Maybe I ought to go out, see him, see how things are
                    before deciding.” So they invited me out there in June, '89. I hadn't seen
                    Kerekou for 15 years. We went into the same enormous room, where I presented my
                    credentials in 1972, for my audience with him. He came out through a small door
                    leading from his office. In this room were only four people: the Foreign
                    Minister was on one side, there were about 20 big, stuffed chairs and he was in
                    one of them; on the other side there was the ambassador, myself, and a young
                    lady—economic officer—who was going to take the notes.</p>
                <p>Kerekou walked in, and he had his carved cane and nodded his head to the Foreign
                    Minister. Then he started to walk towards me. I told the Ambassador: “You never
                    know what's going to happen here.” And in response to the vague way Kerekou
                    looked at me, I said: “Oh, my heavens. He doesn't remember me.”</p>
                <p>His face ended up three feet from mine. He then screamed at the top of his voice:
                    “Mais c'est vous!” He put his arms around me and we hugged each other, and
                    started off once again as if we had seen each other yesterday.</p>
                <p>I told Ambassador Stadtler earlier: “If there's a chemistry that's still there, I
                    want you to suggest that I see Kerekou alone when we can take up items on the
                    agenda that would be difficult for you to do.” He agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Anderson, you were just saying that you had met
                        with Kerekou and had suggested to the American ambassador that you talk to
                        him alone.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After his having recognized you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Right. Well, I subsequently had two meetings alone with him and went
                    over the question of trying to have his country—which is, incidentally, now
                    known as Benin, not Dahomey—to become better known in the United States, and to
                    try and see what could be done here.</p>
                <p>I told them that there were three or four things that I thought he would have to
                    do because, frankly, any Administration in Washington probably concentrates on
                    ten to twenty countries, maybe only fifteen. There are about 150 countries
                    represented in Washington, and the Administration is not going to concentrate on
                    Benin, unless we can find something that will attract its attention. Every once
                    in a while there is something, even for a small country.</p>
                <p>There is something that is going on right today that I cannot talk about. Maybe
                    at some future time I can. It may help Benin attract the attention of top levels
                    in the Administration. I've already talked to Brent Scowcroft about it, and he's
                    rather intrigued as are Hank Cohen, the Assistant Secretary for Africa, and the
                    Assistant Secretary for NEA, John Kelly.</p>
                <p>In any event, Kerekou has changed his stripes in Benin. I don't think that
                    Kerekou himself ever knew what Marxism was, or Leninism was. In any event, he's
                    taken formal steps, which I recommended last June, to declare publicly that
                    Benin is no longer a Marxist-Leninist state. A revised constitution is in the
                    works. He's going to introduce a multi-party system. He's doing all the things
                    that he ought to do to try and improve his country's image. But there's one
                    particular thing he has to do to get our attention, and I hope it's going to
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, does that pretty well wind up your actual tour as
                        ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. I think the main thing was our effort to stimulate the economy.
                    Two or three projects started to succeed, but they all failed after the country
                    was declared a Marxist-Leninist state and Leftists took over.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>There's only one final historical point. That was my first service in a very,
                    very poor country, which opened my eyes considerably. I was delighted to have
                    had that experience. The thing that disturbed me the most about my service there
                    was the fact that the Congress of the United States insisted that our economic
                    and technical assistance be given on a loan basis, and not on a grant basis. And
                    already, then, I could see that we were never going to get paid back. They
                    couldn't pay back the interest or the capital; they didn't have the wherewithal.
                    And this was a terrible political move, and it also, frankly—I considered it
                    almost “inhumanitarian”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now when did this change occur? Because it certainly
                        was not going on in the late '60s or mid-'60s, when I was in East
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: You had all grant aid?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was substantially all grant aid; there were other forms
                        of—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, there were a couple of grant-aid programs, but the main—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially, there were no U.S. Government—there were
                        certainly no U.S. Government loans to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, then there was change between your time in East Africa and it was
                    a dumb move. The only saving grace to that is that when I worked for the Bush
                    campaign last summer as a senior foreign-policy advisor, I attacked this debt
                    problem for the sub-Saharan African countries. I felt that the U.S. Government
                    should cancel those debts, because we are never going to get paid—they were
                    mounting up and up every year. George Bush took this action last summer at the
                    Summit of the Seven in Paris.</p>
                <p>And, if by doing this we now are in a position to wipe this debt off, it gives
                    the commercial banks a little more confidence in countries like Benin, and maybe
                    we can attract some foreign investment, American investment there. But with this
                    official debt hanging over their heads, which could never be repaid anyway, we
                    couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>Regarding the quid pro quo for doing this. A young gentleman named Breeden, who
                    was on the committee that heard me propose this during the campaign—he now
                    happens to be the new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in New
                    York—went after me: “This is ridiculous. They owe us the money and must pay
                    it.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Sure they owe us this money. But we're never going to get it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>“Well, we can't just do this for nothing.”</p>
                <p>I said: “We're not. What we're going to insist on, before we do it, is that they
                    move away from statism to privatization, and that they move away from import
                    substitution to encouraging foreign investment and liberalization of trade. In
                    this way, they may attract, at long last, some foreign investment. This is the
                    name of the game. Because governments are not going to be able to continue
                    giving massive aid. Furthermore, there's no reason to, except in very limited
                    cases of major infrastructure projects.” This was one recommendation Breeden and
                    others accepted, I'm happy to say. That's the last point on Africa I wanted to
                    make.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you came into, next, I guess, probably the most
                        active assignment you ever had, in a way, I imagine. [Laughter] Do you want
                        to tell us something about you got back to be the Department's spokesman?
                        The job, I think, was set up a little differently than it had been before,
                        wasn't it, when you took it over? It used to be a deputy assistant
                        secretary, or sometimes an assistant secretary, or sometimes the assistant
                        secretary for Public Affairs had the job and the spokesman was a layer
                        below. And weren't you the direct spokesman of the secretary, in this
                        case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. Well, let's just focus on what I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You go into it the way you want.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I had the official title of deputy assistant secretary. I was also the
                    special assistant to the Secretary of State for Press Relations. But I was the
                    spokesman of the State Department. The assistant secretary of public affairs did
                    not become the spokesman until Hodding Carter came in with Jimmy Carter. That
                    was a mistake, in my view, you cannot combine those jobs. There's more than
                    enough for the spokesman to do.</p>
                <p>How did I get there? I had a telegram from Larry Eagleburger, who was working for
                    Kissinger, and Bob McCloskey. They asked me if I'd come back. I made my only
                    official telephone call to Washington, in two years, from Cotonou. I told
                    Eagleburger: “That was the most uninformative telegram I have ever received. I'm
                    not about to do this thing, take this on until I know what it's all about,
                    what's going on. The least you can do is order me back, so I can see this man.
                    Maybe he doesn't want me. I want to find out what's going on here.”</p>
                <p>So I was ordered back to Washington very quietly. I was kept up on the seventh
                    floor, because they didn't want the press to know that Kissinger was about to
                    start on his third or fourth spokesman in six months; that, basically, was the
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>So I finally went to meet Dr. Kissinger on the day he got married, as a matter of
                    fact, on a Saturday morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] He was still meeting personnel; not taking much
                        time off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Larry Eagleburger took me in there, along with Bob McCloskey, who had
                    come back from Cyprus, as Ambassador, because Kissinger asked him if he'd fill
                    in as spokesman for a while. And that's why they needed me, because George Vest
                    took's Bob's place, but couldn't handle the job, and asked for a transfer. That
                    is why they turned to me.</p>
                <p>So I went into Kissinger's office and he looked at me and, basically, we—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had some extensive contact with him before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No. I'd seen him in Paris off and on, when he would come over for his
                    Vietnam talks. But I wasn't involved in the talks. So, basically, I hadn't had
                    much contact with him. I was very close to Larry Eagleburger and McCloskey.
                    Basically, Kissinger's opening comment to me was: “Well, you know, I suppose I
                    don't have much choice. And even if you do a lousy job, I can't get rid of
                    you.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Mr. Secretary, that's an unusual way to put this. I don't know whether I
                    can do a good job. I've never been a spokesman. I did fill in for Hubert
                    Humphrey years ago, and I deal with the press a lot. I like the press. But I
                    don't know if I can be a spokesman. “I'm willing to try it if you want me
                    to.”</p>
                <p>“All right. Well, we have to go to the Middle East right away, so you can start
                    on Monday.”</p>
                <p>I said: “No, Mr. Secretary. My wife is in Cotonou. I have to go back there, make
                    my manners with the government of Dahomey, pack up and then return.”</p>
                <p>So he gave me two weeks. One week after I returned to Washington I was off on the
                    31-day shuttle for the Golan Heights. As for Kissinger the man, so much of the
                    period when I was with him is all written down in history. I don't really think
                    I can contribute anything earthshaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there never can be too much said about such a complex
                        figure, but I'm not trying to feed a scandal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: I know that. He was a remarkable man, paranoia and all, I liked and
                    respected him tremendously. To this day he has my total loyalty. All of us, who
                    worked closely with him, feel that way. He could not work alone. I think that
                    he, frankly, if I may say so, liked to use the people that he thought were the
                    best and the brightest of the Foreign Service. He used the Foreign Service to
                    the hilt. He supported us. There were more assistant secretaries who were
                    Foreign Service officers under him than under any other Secretary that I can
                    remember.</p>
                <p>After about six or eight months, when he finally felt that I was loyal to him and
                    could serve as his spokesman satisfactorily, our relationship became extremely
                    close, and is very close to this day. This doesn't mean that he isn't a
                    difficult man. Very bright people are usually very difficult; they really are.
                    He has a lack of patience that is just unbelievable, and I had many problems
                    with him on that.</p>
                <p>I remember once we were in Cairo, Egypt, on one of our stops there. We had the
                    motorcade going out to his plane to rush back to Jerusalem and then on to Amman.
                    Sometimes we did four and five countries in one day. He was, as you might
                    expect, keyed up and anxious to see the Israelis and the Jordanians. Well, part
                    of the press that was travelling with us didn't arrive with the rest of the
                    motorcade. He wanted to take off without them. I said: “No, we can't do this Mr.
                    Secretary. They will be along in a few minutes.”</p>
                <p>He became furious and said: “You are working for me, and we are leaving. I'm
                    going to Jerusalem. I don't care if they're not here.”</p>
                <p>I said: “That is not the way to do it. And it isn't their fault, I'm sure.” Then,
                    finally, we saw this bus struggling onto the airfield, and I kept arguing with
                    him to give the press time to climb aboard. I later found out it was the
                    Egyptians' fault. Our motorcade went so fast because of Kissinger that the press
                    bus couldn't keep up. It wasn't their fault. Little things like this would come
                    up. But they were manageable; put it that way.</p>
                <p>Jeremiah O'Leary. Do you know that name? Washington Star.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard his name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He's one of the most competent, sensitive journalists there is. His
                    father was with the Washington Star. Jerry made a with me personally when I came
                    aboard. He didn't know me from Adam and said: “You won't last six months.
                    Kissinger just eats them alive; eats press spokesmen alive.” Well, I was there
                    two years later. On my departure Jerry wrote a very touching piece about
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By then it was time to move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, I was exhausted. I had found somebody to take my place. That was
                    the secret. If I hadn't have found Bob Funseth, I never would have left. It took
                    a number of months before Henry agreed to it. At the time Jerry O'Leary wrote a
                    very nice piece in the paper, and said: “I lost my bet.” It went into the fact
                    that I was able to handle the job.</p>
                <p>There are some things about Henry. He was one of the nosiest people I've ever
                    met. He always wanted to get into other people's business, and read everything
                    that you were reading. The configuration of the aircraft that we spent 60% of
                    our life on—really we travelled 60% of our time— had his compartment up front
                    with Nancy, and then four big stuffed chairs with a large table on each side of
                    the aisle, where we would be sitting. Henry would keep coming back, looking over
                    our shoulders to see what we were reading or writing.</p>
                <p>I, usually, would have the seat with my back to his compartment. He would come
                    and he would lean on the seat, over my left shoulder. And he was forever taking
                    the telegrams that I was reviewing to get ready for my briefings.</p>
                <p>So we did a couple of things to him once, to try and cure him. We did up a fake
                    telegram, as we were on the way to Portugal from London, for a visit there. It
                    was from our ambassador in Portugal and dealt with the secretary's arrival in
                    Portugal. Things that Kissinger detested were to have hordes of advance people,
                    a lot of folderol, speeches and protocol events. We had this telegram begin
                    with: “A hundred and thirty-six advance people have come from Washington.” We
                    had bands playing. The ambassador said in the telegram: “We tried to turn this
                    off, but the president . . .”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this? Was it Frank Shakespeare, maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, I don't recall who it was. The point is, he picked it up and after
                    reading the first sentence started to get redder and redder as he read through
                    it. In the beginning we had fooled him. Then he looked at all of us, slammed the
                    telegram back down on top of my desk, and said laughingly: “Why you do this to
                    me?” He came back a minute later and grabbed the telegram. “I must show it to
                    Nancy.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Another thing we used to do concerned Hal Sonnenfeldt, who is not the world's
                    most loveable man. He was always trying to go on trips with Kissinger, but most
                    of the time remained in Washington. During our trips we'd do up fake telegrams
                    giving reports of Sonnenfeldt press conferences in Washington, of Sonnenfeldt
                    meetings at the White House and of other Sonnenfeldt exploits. When Kissinger
                    would see this, that somebody else was giving a press conference and learn what
                    Hal had been up to... [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What job did Sonnenfeldt have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Counselor of the State Department.Now there was one thing I wrote down
                    about Dr. Kissinger, which is rather a personal thing, that occurred on March
                    25, 1975. We had gone over, again, to the Middle East, on a trip, March 5 to
                    March 23, to try conclude the Sinai II agreement. Rabin was Prime Minister then,
                    and we thought that it was all set. We'd been led to believe that if we went
                    over and negotiated this thing out, that there was no internal division within
                    the Israeli Government on this, and that we would be able to do it. Well, it
                    turned out that there was a serious problem within the Israeli Government. We
                    negotiated and negotiated and negotiated, and were going to have to go home
                    without an agreement.</p>
                <p>So the day before we went back—it was on a Saturday, and the Israelis wanted to
                    have a Cabinet meeting, to see if they could iron out a position. We went to
                    Masada, the famous place where the Jews way back in history committed suicide by
                    jumping off this huge rock, to spend the day while the Israeli Cabinet was
                    meeting in Jerusalem. We went over by helicopter. The press went with us. I was
                    sitting in the helicopter across from Henry. Nancy was along, but he was sitting
                    alone.</p>
                <p>And I wrote the following, which I think is of interest here because this was a
                    very difficult period for our foreign relations. You have to bear in mind that
                    Nixon went out the year before, Ford was in, we were losing Cambodia, Vietnam,
                    etc. Let me just read what I wrote on the helicopter as I looked at this unusual
                    figure:"Went to Masada this morning, by helicopter. HAK sat alone, sad, very
                    reflective; a small, round man, obviously thinking his efforts, which had been
                    superhuman, for peace, were hanging in the balance. With his mood on this trip,
                    cheerful, considerate, I do not think he is worrying about his own future. He
                    will already go down in history as one of our greatest secretaries of state.
                    Rather, he is concerned, profoundly sad, and frustrated, almost to the point of
                    helplessness, over the unravelling of American Foreign Policy; Cambodia,
                    Vietnam, Portugal, Turkey, the Middle East, Western Europe, a world-wide
                    recession, energy, food, you name it. The West is in disarray. And the domestic
                    weakness—economic, political, and psychological—of the United States cannot
                    provide the necessary leadership. This is what troubles HAK, Henry
                    Kissinger.”</p>
                <p>It sums up Henry, you know, pretty well, especially, Tully, if we remember that
                    even today—and he's been out of office now for a long time—if any real crisis
                    comes in the world, he still is the one that the media go to, unfailingly, to
                    seek an informal opinion. They seldom turn to other ex-Secretaries or
                    ex-Presidents for that matter. He commands an almost unique position of
                    influence in the field of foreign affairs here in the United States and
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: But that's enough for now on Kissinger. Do you want to move on to
                    Morocco?</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I think that's good, because obviously you had
                        something to say about the world crisis every day, and you were quoted in
                        the paper, and so that's all on record.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, and every press briefing I ever gave, I have the texts of them.
                    They're there.</p>
                <p>Now on Morocco, where I went in March, '76, there are three or four points that I
                    might mention. One, the King himself, King Hassan, is a truly remarkable person,
                    whom Henry Kissinger qualifies as a statesman; Henry doesn't say that about many
                    people. Why does he feel that way about Hassan?</p>
                <p>When Kissinger came in as Secretary of State, you may remember, that was the
                    first time that he then decided, after the '73 war, to become involved in the
                    Middle East. The first stop he made, before he went out there was to see the
                    King in Rabat. The King briefed him on every person he was going to see on his
                    trip. He talked to him about Sadat. He talked to him about Faisal in Saudi
                    Arabia. He talked to him about Hussein in Jordan; Assad in Syria, and even
                    Boumedienne in Algeria. Henry had never met any of these people.</p>
                <p>What's more, the King sent his Foreign Minister, Taibi Benhima, in advance of
                    Kissinger to each stop; Taibi could brief all of these leaders on the King's
                    impression of Kissinger. Henry never forgot that.</p>
                <p>Now Hassan is no fool. He felt, “I'm of use to the United States of America and
                    because of this the Americans will support me.” He did this on the question of
                    Sadat going to Jerusalem. There are certain initiatives that King Hassan took to
                    bring the Egyptians and the Israelis together; it never would have occurred
                    without Hassan.</p>
                <p>Here again, he knows that we never would have had Camp David later on. None of
                    these events would have occurred if it hadn't been for Hassan's actions when I
                    was in Morocco. Phil Habib, who visited me at the time, and I were privileged to
                    learn of what transpired on condition that we remain silent about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our posture in Morocco at the time you went
                        there? Did we still have communications bases, but no military bases, so to
                        speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's correct. We had two communications facilities, but no military
                    bases as such. While I was there, the U.S. Navy made the decision to close the
                    communications facilities. I found out about this just by luck; hearsay at one
                    of the facilities. I was not told officially. I was concerned in view of
                    Hassan's reaction in light of what he had been doing to help us in many
                    areas.</p>
                <p>I went back to Washington and saw the vice CNO, and the Secretary of Defense,
                    commenting: “Look, you don't do this just like that. King Hassan is a friend of
                    the United States and doing some very valuable things for us. Any action we take
                    must avoid showing a lack of confidence in him. Let us study this plan. If the
                    Navy says it doesn't need the communications facilities, that's fine. But let's
                    see if there's anything else we would like to have from Morocco in a security
                    sense.”</p>
                <p>So the Army, Navy, and Air Force were asked to look into this. In the meantime no
                    final action was to be taken as to closing the facilities. All sorts of wish
                    lists came in. Some were ridiculous; some practically wanted to go back to
                    Morocco and make it a colony of the U.S. But finally, there were two or three
                    items that would be politically palatable. I went to the King—and this is all in
                    the history books—and told him that we were going to close, outlined the very
                    orderly way we planned to do this and sought his approval of our plan and our
                    desire to consider two new security operations in Morocco.</p>
                <p>The King made a very sensible comment when I told him about closing these
                    facilities because we were going to rely on satellites. He said: “Well, I'm not
                    a communications expert, Mr. Ambassador, but you might tell Washington that I am
                    perfectly willing to have them leave any of the equipment here in mothballs in
                    case there's a war and the Russians shoot down your satellites and you will be
                    in need of these older communications systems. You might want to use these
                    again.”</p>
                <p>I relayed this to Washington. “No, no, no, no was the answer.” Later on, that's
                    just what the Navy wanted to do and it was too late, because they moved all the
                    equipment into Spain, where its future use is farm from assured. And to think we
                    could have had this. The King was a very far-sighted individual.</p>
                <p>There is another subject that I think we ought to concentrate on. This concerns
                    the Sahara. I recommend that anyone who has the time and wants to be serious
                    about the historical evolution of the Sahara, should focus on one or two things
                    here. There was an international-court-of-justice opinion, which if read
                    objectively, indicates that there certainly is a Moroccan claim to the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>But the key here, I have always felt, is the gentleman who is now the President
                    of Austria, Kurt Waldheim. I consider that he is the man primarily responsible
                    for the war in the Sahara continuing. He was up for reelection as UN Secretary
                    General. Butaflika was the Foreign Minister of Algeria at the time, and
                    President of the UN General Assembly. Waldheim took some actions that were not
                    neutral, and had sided with the Algerian position. And this caused—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To ensure his own reelection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, I'm sure, especially when one recalls the dominating influence of
                    Algeria in the Third World. For example, Waldheim sent a Swede, Rydbeck, who was
                    in the political office at the U.N., as a neutral observer to go and talk to the
                    different sides. Rydbeck was totally on the Algerian side. There was a census of
                    the 75,000 people that were there at the time Spain left the Sahara. Waldheim
                    refused to give it to the Moroccans to conduct any kind of a referendum. The
                    rest of it is all written down. But I just wanted to flag this. Kurt Waldheim
                    did not distinguish himself here.</p>
                <p>Again on our relations with France, there is one specific point here to show that
                    if you gain the confidence of the French you can work with them. Bids were out
                    for a radar air traffic control system, to encompass the entire country,
                    including the Sahara. Westinghouse had put in a bid. The French had put in a
                    bid. Giscard d'Estaing, who was President of France, kept calling the King to
                    try to win this bid for France. This was a $120,000,000 or more contract, a
                    significant contract.</p>
                <p>I was having a meeting with the King, and he brought this subject up. He said:
                    “This Westinghouse bid is much lower than the French, and the quality is
                    better.”</p>
                <p>Once I heard that, I said to him, “Well, you know that one of the objectives that
                    I have here is to try and bring American investment in, because you want to
                    diversify, don't you?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>I said: “If I have to, to make sure that this bid is treated fairly, may I used
                    this information that you just gave me, on price and quality?”</p>
                <p>He said: “Absolutely.”</p>
                <p>So I went to the French Ambassador and told him about it, I said: “I know that
                    your President is calling the King. But here are the facts. We've been dealing
                    with each other very honestly. I'm going to go after this. And, you know, if, in
                    light of what I have been told, the French win this contract, I am never again
                    going to recommend that any American company invest one penny here. And I think
                    you'd agree.”</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>He said: “No, I don't blame you.”</p>
                <p>I continued: “I would like you, to the extent you can, politically—not to push
                    it. If your President wants to call the King, that's fine. But you don't have to
                    push it at this end.”</p>
                <p>He said: “I will play fairly.”</p>
                <p>David Rockefeller happened to be visiting Morocco at the time the Finance
                    Minister, who was a good friend and involved in the selection of the contract,
                    gave him a dinner. So at the Minister's house, I asked David if he would come
                    with me for a moment, and we stood at the stairwell, together with the
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>I said to the Minister in French: “I want you to know, Mr. Minister, and I want
                    David Rockefeller to hear this. I have the Westinghouse people here now
                    negotiating for the radar contact. I want you to know that I've been told about
                    the price and the quality of their proposal. If anything happens on this
                    contract, and anybody else that has lower quality or higher price receives this
                    contract, I will never recommend that any American company come to your country
                    to invest one penny. I wanted the chairman of Chase Manhattan to hear this
                    conversation.”</p>
                <p>Three days later, Westinghouse was awarded the biggest contract in history for an
                    American firm in Morocco. I think this is historically important because it
                    shows what one can do if one cooperates with the French, and they don't become
                    suspicious of you.</p>
                <p>An amusing story on Melilla and Gibraltar. One fine morning, an urgent call from
                    the King to go and see him. And it so happened, the British ambassador received
                    a similar call. We both ended up there together. The King was talking away, and
                    all of a sudden, the King looked at me and smiled very slightly. He turned to
                    the British ambassador, and said: “There's been talk about my trying to go after
                    Ceuta and Melilla. But I want you to know that I am not going to give my kingly
                    brother, Juan Carlos, any problem. He has enough problems moving his country
                    forward. What I would like you to know, Mr. Ambassador, is that when Spain gets
                    Gibraltar back, I am then going to turn Ceuta and Melilla to Morocco. Because by
                    that time, that won't be a problem for Juan Carlos. You may tell London this.”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>The Ambassador was a Scotsman named Jock Duncan. On leaving the meeting he said:
                    “Bob, I am not sure I really understand all of this. Do you think we could have
                    a small drink before lunch to review what His Majesty had to say before I
                    communicate with London?”</p>
                <p>I said: “Come on over, Jock.” We went over the meeting so he understood exactly
                    what the King meant.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>When Jimmy Carter became president, our policy towards Morocco changed
                    dramatically. It was a policy that I could not agree with, because I felt it was
                    founded on false premises. The basic premise was that we wanted to have improved
                    relations with Algeria, and that to improve those relations with Algeria, you
                    couldn't remain friends with Morocco. That was absolutely wrong.</p>
                <p>Dick Parker, a career officer, who you probably know, was our Ambassador to
                    Algeria then. He had been number two in our Embassy in Rabat under Ambassador
                    Stuart Rockwell. This was early on in the Carter Administration. I suggested to
                    Dick: “Look, why don't you and I go someplace, sit down and iron this thing out,
                    and really try and think it through?” Dick and I eventually me for four days
                    alone in Madrid. We came up with a joint telegram, which Roy Atherton
                    subsequently said was unheard of in the Foreign Service where two ambassadors
                    representing countries that were not exactly friendly, could come to a joint
                    assessment. Basically Dick and I believed that there was absolutely no reason
                    why you could not be friends with both countries.</p>
                <p>There are a number of things that entered this picture, I believe. There were
                    certain people in the United States that wanted to get LNG (liquid natural gas),
                    for New England. Clark Clifford represented some interests in Algeria, and was
                    close to Carter. Jim Schlesinger, who was Energy Secretary, told me at one
                    point: “The worst thing we could ever do is make a long-term contract with
                    Algeria for liquid natural gas for the northeast of the United States. The
                    Algerians would hold that over our head and use it as a tool against us.”</p>
                <p>One of the main problems that we had was the question of OV-10 reconnaissance
                    aircraft, and again, I'm not going to go into this in detail, because it is part
                    of history. But the King asked me to see if he could get half a dozen of them.
                    They were really small observation-type planes to use in the Sahara, to see what
                    was going on. Our position on the Sahara was so pro-Algerian then. We wouldn't
                    let them do anything to displease Algeria, which was absolutely wrong. The
                    Libyans were helping out, the Algerians were recruiting Tuareg tribesmen by the
                    tens of thousands for the Sahara. We were practically signing the death warrant
                    of Morocco for a while.</p>
                <p>I did see a lot of Al Haig, at that time. He was the SACEUR in Brussels. I saw
                    him when I was still Ambassador, and then after I left, in October, '78, and
                    went to work for the Commander-in-Chief Atlantic, in Norfolk, who was also the
                    Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic. I used to see Al Haig in Brussels, four or
                    five a year when I was over there on NATO matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Al Haig understood the picture; that the Moroccans had to be given some help, or
                    else we might lose this very valuable ally. All I want to say on the record
                    there is that the day that Al Haig became Secretary of State, he was sworn in in
                    the late morning, walked over to the State Department, and made his first
                    remarks on the stairs, where he said something that I think he should not have
                    said. To announce: “I'm the vicar of foreign policy for this Administration,”
                    was not his brightest remark and did not go down well. He then went to his
                    office, and that afternoon ordered and implemented all of the things he and I
                    had talking about for four years, on military assistance to Morocco. He did it
                    that afternoon. It was the first act he did as Secretary of State. That action
                    helped enormously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result of these troubles going on then, did you
                        resign, or was this just coming to the end of a term, more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No. I didn't resign. I loyally carried out every policy that I was told
                    to. On the other hand, I continued to send in my views. I think that probably
                    the White House and State were getting a little weary of reading them. One
                    reason for my departure concerns Dick Parker. He was our ambassador in Lebanon,
                    after Algeria. And Dick had some health problems in Lebanon. He's an old Near
                    East hand, as you know, and they wanted to find a place for him right away. So
                    they chose Morocco. He'd been there before as DCM. I guess the timing of my
                    transfer was a combination of that and having to look at my telegrams all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>But I have to tell you, that Dick only remained for a short time. The King never
                    focused on the agr�ment. One or two of the coup d'�tat attempts took place when
                    Dick was the DCM. He was not pro-monarchy, and his views were known in Morocco
                    on that score. He and the King just didn't hit it off, and the King then made a
                    decision that he didn't want any more career people. He was very unhappy that I
                    left, and he tried everything he could to keep me there. He said: “I don't agree
                    with President Carter's policy.” But he said: “At least you understand us and I
                    know you're honest, you're objective, and you report what our policy is. And I
                    can't ask anything more from you. And I have confidence in you.” Therefore,
                    after Dick Parker's departure, Angie Duke went out and they've had politicos
                    ever since.</p>
                <p>There's one other point I want to say about the King. In the beginning when I
                    arrived there, he had been using the CIA as his main channel to Washington. He
                    had a tendency to do this all the time, and not using the State Department, nor
                    the embassy, nor the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duly encouraged by the CIA, usually, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. Well, we wanted to get rid of this practice. I took with me a
                    private letter from Kissinger to the King. In it Kissinger suggested that the
                    King could entrust to me anything he had on his mind, and that I had the access
                    to him and to the President, and that he would prefer that business be done that
                    way, to avoid confusion. That had a tremendous effect, and was one of the
                    reasons I was very close to the King.</p>
                <p>I think we'd better stop here, if you don't mind.</p>
                <p>[April 9, 1990 interview begins]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Anderson, it's good to have you back. You had
                        just, I think, finished your assignment in Morocco, but hadn't told us where
                        you went from there. Do you want to pick up as you leave Morocco, and tell
                        us what you did and how you came to do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I'd be delighted to, Tully. I left Morocco in October of '78, and
                    started off on a new job right away. It was a combination of a job in Washington
                    and Norfolk, Virginia. I was assigned as Special Assistant for International
                    Relations to the Commander-in-Chief Atlantic, who also had the NATO hat of the
                    Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic. This was Admiral Harry D. Train III.</p>
                <p>This was one of the more fascinating assignments of my Foreign Service career,
                    quite different from any of my others, but extremely valuable as an educational
                    assignment. In addition, because of the admiral I worked with, I think that I
                    was able to make a contribution to, shall we say, military-civilian
                    relationships in our own government. Admiral Train, in my view, is one of the
                    most brilliant minds that I have ever come across. Admiral Train, as far as I'm
                    concerned—and I came to know all of the top Navy officers, during this
                    assignment of almost four years—and Bill Crowe, who has just finished up as the
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, probably are the two most formidable Navy brains
                    in this century. They were absolutely unbelievable. This made the assignment so
                    satisfying and precious to me, to be very honest with you.</p>
                <p>I'll go right to the end of my assignment for a moment, regarding Admiral Train.
                    When I was about to leave, to go as ambassador to the Dominican Republic, I went
                    over to see Frank Carlucci, who was the Deputy Secretary of Defense. I was very
                    concerned that the administration might choose not to continue to use Admiral
                    Train, who had already been SACLANT and CINCLANT for over three years with four
                    years the limit for that assignment. He should have been made CNO. But as in
                    many institutions of our government, politics enters into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very heavily at that level, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Very. I'm afraid that because of that—the then Secretary of the Navy
                    had his definite feelings about certain other naval officers—Harry Train did not
                    receive this appointment.</p>
                <p>But one thing, that did disappoint me. Frank Carlucci took me in the back door to
                    see Secretary [Caspar] Weinberger to talk about Admiral Train. And I told the
                    secretary of my three and a half-odd years with him, and what a superior person
                    he was, and especially how allied governments thought so highly of him, because
                    as SACLANT, he had relations with all of the top civilian and military officials
                    of our NATO allies.</p>
                <p>I said to Weinberger: “All right, if he can't be CNO, don't lose this man's
                    service to our country. Reappoint him, again, as CINCLANT. And I'm sure the
                    allies would love to keep him on as SACLANT. Or maybe send him over to Italy, as
                    the top NATO commander in Naples, because earlier in his career, he was the
                    commander of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. He knows Italy and NATO like
                    the back of his hand. Above all, keep him in the service.”</p>
                <p>Weinberger looked at Carlucci, and he said: “That's a very good idea. We'll take
                    care of this.” They never gave him anything. And I was very disappointed, but
                    there was nothing more that I could do. I see Harry today on projects we get
                    together on, and still have a tremendous admiration for him.</p>
                <p>But back to my assignment of almost three and a half years with him. I spent
                    maybe 60% of my time travelling abroad with Admiral Train. He took me on every
                    trip he made. And that's what made the job. Some top NATO, or top American,
                    military officers don't use their State Department people the way that he did.
                    He included me in all his meetings with military and civilian leaders.</p>
                <p>I emphasized to him that it was necessary for him to concentrate, in the NATO
                    framework, on civilian leadership, not just military leaders. I urged him to see
                    all of the NATO ambassadors. He saw the NATO foreign ministers and the NATO
                    prime ministers in their different capitals. And he was able to gain valuable
                    insights. And they were able to learn from him. As the Supreme Allied Commander
                    Atlantic, he had the responsibility for the allied defense of the entire
                    Atlantic, including the North Atlantic, right up to the Arctic Circle, and down
                    to the Tropic of Cancer which is the so-called limit of the NATO boundary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In theory, I suppose he would not be concerned with Italy
                        or Greece or Turkey, because they're not—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, the ships would leave his command when they approached Gibraltar to
                    go into the Mediterranean, and they would then go under the—the acronym is
                    CINCUSNAVEUR, with headquarters in London. They would cross over to his command
                    once they got into the Mediterranean.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I said earlier that this assignment was a fascinating one, and that I thought
                    because of the way Admiral Train wanted to use me, that maybe I was able to make
                    a contribution here and there. Here are a few examples.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened after I went to work for him was to go down
                    to Key West, which at that time had a very large naval base. The Carter
                    Administration was trying to save money here and there, as we know, and they
                    were particularly going after the military. There was a move afoot to close down
                    naval bases at Key West and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>But there was a paradox that arose here because they also were trying to close
                    certain naval air stations elsewhere in the United States. And so they thought
                    that maybe, as far as the naval air station in Key West was concerned, they
                    would be able to transfer some of the squadrons down there for their flight
                    training. The planners forgot it was only 90 miles from Cuba, among other
                    things.</p>
                <p>And I went down there, and, looked into this situation. Could the Key West naval
                    station absorb a great number of other naval aircraft? It was quite clear that
                    from a political point of view to have airplanes flying around so close to Cuba
                    would not be good. It also was quite apparent that the authorities in Florida
                    would not permit it. Air congestion would have become horrendous, because Key
                    West happened to be in a prime area where commercial airliners were flying over
                    and going to and from the U.S. from South America. The whole thing was a
                    disaster.</p>
                <p>I reported this to Admiral Train, who sent me to Washington. And I, as a
                    civilian, had easy access to the military. I explained the situation and said
                    the plans should not be carried out. Because of this, a number of air stations
                    remained open elsewhere in the United States, and they did not move their
                    aircraft to Key West. The Navy was grateful to me for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You accomplished two things for them, really. You kept
                        things from closing and kept them from making a mistake.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. Another question came up, that had to do with the U.S.
                    military organization setup in the whole Caribbean area. After going with
                    Admiral Train to visit some of the small, independent nations there, we saw that
                    it made no sense, whatsoever, to have the United States Army command in Panama,
                    called SOUTHCOM, have the defense responsibilities on land for all of these
                    little island nations, while the U.S. Navy had the defense responsibilities for
                    the water around all of these islands. This included military assistance, as
                    well as disaster assistance, if the military was called upon. Here you had a
                    headquarters about as far away from the Caribbean as you can get, way in the
                    western extremity, having to deal with these nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We went to the Bahamas, and were meeting with the prime minister there. And he
                    was baffled by this because he didn't know very much about CINCLANT, the
                    Commander-in-Chief Atlantic, until Harry Train went there. He suddenly realized
                    that here was the man who probably, if anything happened, would be the fellow to
                    help out, because he was the commander-in-chief, which meant that all the
                    military services would come under his command in time of conflict.</p>
                <p>So a turf battle started. I started it, and I finished it. Harry Train wisely
                    stayed out of this one, although he wanted it this way. Finally the Army lost
                    the land responsibilities for the small island nations of the Caribbean, and
                    that went over to CINCLANT, where they should have been in the first place. If a
                    disaster occurred, you would have CINCLANT handle a hurricane in Dominica not
                    the Army people, sitting way down in Panama trying to cope with it with assets
                    from the U.S.</p>
                <p>But I can tell you a lot of blood flowed over that issue, and I think the Army
                    would have welcomed seeing some of my blood flow but they didn't catch me. But
                    it now is a much more sensible setup, and even the Army recognizes that it was a
                    very useful reorganization.</p>
                <p>When I was with Harry, I suggested that he institute an annual West African
                    cruise, because the CINCLANT area went right over to West Africa. So Harry made
                    the first such cruise. We flew out in his P-3, and met two of our ships on
                    arrival in Ghana. We started seeing all the chiefs of state and the prime
                    ministers and others in each country visited. This helped the United States
                    presence very much; I might say, during the Carter period when the relations
                    with some foreign nations were not all that good, as far as the civilian leaders
                    were concerned. These cruises continue to this day.</p>
                <p>Admiral Train did the same thing once a year, as far as the Caribbean and South
                    America were concerned. In the Caribbean itself, it would actually be on one of
                    his ships and we'd go and visit four or five countries a year. When we'd visited
                    South America we'd use his P-3 because of the great distances. These visits were
                    particularly valuable in Latin America, again because our political
                    relationships with many of the nations were not very warm under the Carter
                    Administration. This made it all the more necessary to try and keep the
                    military-to-military relationship as solid as we could, during this period.</p>
                <p>Admiral Train was a master at this. In doing all of this, I was in extremely
                    close touch with the State Department, as well as the Defense Department, and
                    the NSC in the White House. In preparing Admiral Train for these different
                    visits, whether it be to Africa or someplace in Latin America, I'd tell them
                    ahead of time that the Admiral was going to go here, here, and here. First, I'd
                    get their concurrence for the visits, and then ask if there was anything he
                    could do to be helpful? It was a very cooperative program that was welcomed by
                    the White House and the State Department, and often used to their advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with Mr. Noriega at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: We called on him very briefly. He was number two. The top fellow wasn't
                    available. Relations were not that good, at all. Let me put it this way. The
                    stop we made in Panama does not stand out as one of the highlights of my tour of
                    duty.</p>
                <p>There's one thing, from an historical point of view, that I think might be useful
                    for someone to look into. This has to do with NATO. As we know, a number of our
                    allies, in order to avoid assuming responsibilities in certain parts of the
                    world, even when their interests are at stake, say: “No, this cannot be
                    discussed in NATO, because this problem is outside the NATO area.” This is, if I
                    may put it very bluntly, hogwash. I think that a serious scholar could look into
                    this and maybe write a little something about it. Admiral Train and I went over
                    this many times together, and we talked with a number of our friends. In fact,
                    other military leaders agreed completely with us. You have to go back to Article
                    V, and Article VI, of the NATO Treaty. And as you know, Tully, Article V is the
                    article that says, more or less, an attack on one is an attack on all, and each
                    nation will then decide on how it's going to come to the assistance of the
                    nation. It isn't automatic; we couldn't have that completely because of the
                    Vandenberg Resolution.</p>
                <p>Article VI of the NATO Treaty defines the NATO area in relationship to Article V.
                    That was very explicit. It said the territories of the NATO countries—the
                    Algerian departments of North Africa, and then the outer limit is the Tropic of
                    Cancer. But they did this with regard to the attack-on-one, attack-on-all clause
                    in Article V.</p>
                <p>Now, there is nothing whatsoever in the NATO Treaty which says that if a problem
                    arises, say in the Persian Gulf or South of the Tropic of Cancer, that this
                    cannot be discussed in NATO; there's nothing in the treaty that says that the
                    NATO allies can't get together and do something about that problem.</p>
                <p>You have to look very carefully at Article V. A very specific example of the
                    attitude of the military commanders is this—and I checked with Admiral Train
                    last weekend on this one point, as a matter of fact. The Tri-MNC study, that was
                    done when I was with Admiral Train—MNC is Major NATO Command. The Tri-MNC means
                    SACEUR (South of Brussels); SACLANT, who is Admiral Train; and the third major
                    NATO commander is CINCHAN, Commander in Chief of the Channel, and he's a Brit.
                    And they sat down and drew up their plans.</p>
                <p>And one of the plans that they have is that if the sea lanes around South Africa
                    are put into jeopardy, the MNCs will consult and take the action necessary to
                    protect the continuation of the supplies that are necessary for the security and
                    economic well-being of our NATO nations. This is certainly South of the Tropic
                    of Cancer. I think that this, historically, is something that ought to be looked
                    into.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I don't think I need to go into too much more of my assignment with Admiral
                    Train, unless you can think of any particular hole that I've left out. I wanted
                    to just give you a feel for it. It was a fantastic assignment that I enjoyed.
                    And I went on from there to Santo Domingo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you felt, generally, by this time, after many years,
                        that we do have a feeling for each other; that is, the Foreign Service, the
                        State Department, Defense, and the military establishment. You're happy
                        about the coordination as of the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, I found tremendous cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm thinking a little bit of worldwide attitudes,
                        because I think they have improved immensely, though, over the last 30
                        years. I was a POLAD [political advisor] in 1955, so I go a long way back on
                        this. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, I think it has improved. I think another reason it's improved is
                    there are more and more exchanges of assignments between the State Department
                    and the Defense Department.</p>
                <p>There's one point that I do want to go back emphasize the value of the
                    military-to-military relationship, and how deep this is. This has to do with
                    France. Because of my own background in France, and interest in it, I was able
                    to persuade Admiral Train that this is a country that he should become very,
                    very close to. And he did to the point where a most unusual thing happened,
                    because of Admiral Train and his personality.</p>
                <p>We went up to Brest, in France, on a number of occasions to visit the huge naval
                    headquarters there. And again I emphasize, because of Admiral Train and the way
                    that he had been able to establish a relationship of confidence with the top
                    military leaders in France, they took us into their nuclear submarine base. They
                    went over every single point of interest to us, not only showing us the
                    submarines, but their plans and everything else. With the French, I have to say
                    that on the military-to-military relationship, an awful lot of things can be
                    done.</p>
                <p>If it shifts over into the political leadership, things will not get done. I
                    firmly believe that that is the case today, also. Today, for example, we are
                    having problems with them, with regard to the reunification of Germany; we don't
                    seem to be able, on the political level, to understand each other. On the future
                    of NATO, in light of what's happening, it seems to be a dialogue of the
                    deaf.</p>
                <p>But on the military-to-military side, this does not happen. I just wish that we
                    could get a better political dialogue going, and it's something that on the
                    outside, I'm trying to help bring along. Admiral Train was a master with the
                    French. They loved him. He had them coming over, visiting him, all the time in
                    Norfolk. That was just a little addendum there.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I will move now, if you would like, to my last assignment in the Foreign Service,
                    which was as ambassador to the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Bill Clark, who was the number-two in the State Department and Al Haig
                    asked me if I would take on this assignment. Al Haig, in particular, wanted to
                    get, shall we say, some outside blood into the Latin American Bureau. He got
                    Dean Hinton down there, and he got Tom Pickering, and two or three others, and I
                    was one of those. This was one of the more challenging assignments I've had. It
                    was a very delicate one, because of the historical relations between the
                    Dominican Republic and the United States, the nearness to the United States, the
                    dependence of the Dominican Republic on the United States, in so many ways.</p>
                <p>And anyone that goes down there has to conduct himself or herself, as an
                    ambassador, in a very circumspect way it's so easy to be taken as a governor
                    general or some kind of lord and master even today. I found that the
                    delicateness of this assignment was a great challenge, because you were on the
                    stage 24 hours a day, literally. In anything you did, the Dominicans were
                    watching, and they would report it in the news, on the television, and in the
                    newspapers, etc. So one had to be aware of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get us oriented timewise, this was about June
                        1982, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. I think I received my call from President Reagan around
                    Thanksgiving, 1981. I actually went out in '82, because, as you know,
                    confirmation takes longer and longer because of all these ethics requirements
                    and every other blessed thing that go on now. I stayed with Admiral Train up
                    until about end of January.</p>
                <p>And then I went to the Foreign Service Institute, because I had to learn Spanish;
                    I didn't know any Spanish. This was my first and only assignment in Latin
                    America. And I must say, I managed to get a half decent mark, and within six
                    months, I gave my first press conference down there, and was able to, above all,
                    talk alone with the president. That was the key thing down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Well, when I started to prepare myself to go down to the Dominican Republic, they
                    had elections in May of that year, and a gentleman named Salvador Jorge Blanco
                    was elected president. When the U.S. troops went in, in '65, Ellsworth Bunker
                    went down and stayed for a year or more, and brought the opposing civilian
                    factions together to form a government. One of the gentlemen sitting across from
                    him at the table was Salvador Jorge Blanco, who was not considered a
                    conservative by our people, and possibly bad news for us. So here he was elected
                    president, and some of our folks felt that this could be a disaster for the
                    United States. I remember, Dick Walters—General Vernon Walters—in particular; he
                    knew Joaquin Balaguer, who was president for about 12 years before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went in about '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Twelve years, and then he had three terms. He was voted out and a
                    democratic change took place, and a gentleman named Guzm�n was made president.
                    I'll mention him in a minute. Then Jorge Blanco, the same party as Guzm�n, won
                    the election.</p>
                <p>Walters said: “The only person that can really govern this country is Balaguer.
                    All these others are too far to the left.” I couldn't understand this very
                    clearly; I didn't know much about Jorge Blanco at all then, except that he was a
                    very successful lawyer from Santiago, who represented a number of American
                    companies. I couldn't see where he was a socialist or anti-private enterprise,
                    or anything else.</p>
                <p>And so I asked Ellsworth Bunker, one of the dearest friends I've ever had and one
                    whom I respect very deeply, if he would have lunch with me at the Metropolitan
                    Club to talk to me about the Dominican Republic. And I asked Ellsworth: “You
                    know, I get these readings about Jorge Blanco, who's going to be president, that
                    are not very flattering.”</p>
                <p>He said: “That's ridiculous. He is a pragmatist. He will be fine as president.
                    He's very bright, brilliant, and he will cooperate. But he's his own man.”I
                    said: “Ellsworth, that is marvelous. Thank you, sir.” I did not worry about it
                    from that day on, once I had Ellsworth's very objective and wise counsel.</p>
                <p>So I went down there in June and I met President Antonio Guzm�n, presented my
                    credentials on a Saturday, two weeks before July Fourth. We agreed we'd meet one
                    week later; I told him I really would like to sit down and have a substantive
                    chat with him. The following Friday night, he had a very serious gunshot wound
                    and died the next day, the day I was supposed to see him.</p>
                <p>The only reason I want to go into this a little bit is an example of why I am
                    convinced that the wonderful job that Ellsworth Bunker did, to establish a
                    democratic base back in the mid-'60s was extremely valuable, and it took
                    hold.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The basic answer to establishing a successful democracy in the Dominican Republic
                    was to get the military out of politics. Balaguer, in the beginning, was just
                    the man to take over the leadership of the country after Trujillo, because he
                    worked for Trujillo. He's a caudillo. He's a dictator himself. The only
                    difference is Balaguer didn't throw people to the sharks, didn't beat people,
                    kill people. But he was very authoritarian, and if one didn't do things his way,
                    certain economic difficulties might arise: Let's put it that way. He started the
                    process of removing the military from power.</p>
                <p>Guzm�n, who took over peacefully from Balaguer, was a master at taking further
                    steps to get the military out of power. He would retire some of them; he'd
                    rotate them. That was his greatest contribution to his nation. Because by the
                    time that Jorge Blanco was due to come in, the military accepted the fact that
                    it no longer was a political force, and that its role was to accept the civilian
                    leadership of the country.</p>
                <p>Now, here you had a president who some say shot himself, but I have always said
                    to our own government: “If the Dominicans wish to say that, that's fine. But we
                    should not say that.” Because with a suicidal death, as you know, you lose
                    certain rights of the church and all sorts of other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The only record I found on this, in my hasty review,
                        refers to it as suicide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. They did. But I told our embassy: “We're never going to
                    say this,” and we didn't.</p>
                <p>Now here, mind you, I had been in the country about ten days. I received a call
                    at 11:00 at night, from the palace, from a General Imbert Berrera, who was the
                    man that drove the car, that had the people in it who shot Trujillo. He was an
                    advisor to Guzm�n in the palace. I had not yet met him. He called me to tell me
                    what had happened, and asked if I could get some medical help to save his life.
                    I got hold of the watch officer at the White House, and in point of fact, we
                    were able to get a medical plane out of Holmstead Air Force Base down right
                    away. But it came too late. I think that probably he was virtually dead when
                    Berrera called me.</p>
                <p>I called my staff together and asked: “Okay, this is what's happened. According
                    to the Constitution, what's the next step? Because here you have the president,
                    who remains president until August 15, when Jorge Blanco is supposed to be
                    inaugurated. So we have a 45-day period here, where somebody else will get to be
                    president. I assume it's the vice president. Is that right?” And so we got out
                    the Constitution and there was a specific article calling for him to take over
                    immediately.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I called back General Imbert Berrera immediately. I didn't want to see anything
                    happen here, where the military might suddenly do something in this very unusual
                    situation. I told him: “I know Washington will be extremely interested in what's
                    going to happen now.” This was after he confirmed to me that he had died. I
                    said: “According to your Constitution,” and I was able to read him the articles
                    and everything else, over the phone, “I understand this, this, and this are
                    supposed to happen.” I said: “I assume that actions are being taken right now to
                    install the vice president as the civilian president for the balance of this
                    administration.”</p>
                <p>And he said: “Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Well, I'm delighted. And I wish you would tell the people at the palace,
                    and the new president, that I am so informing Washington right away. And I wish
                    you'd also, if any of the military leadership is there, tell them that, too,
                    would you please.”</p>
                <p>And they got the message, I can tell you, because 72 hours later I received a
                    call from this General Berrera. I had since been to Santiago and attended the
                    funeral as one of the pallbearers. General Berrera: “The military leadership
                    would like to pay a formal call on you at the embassy.”</p>
                <p>I said: “Fine. Is there any particular reason?”</p>
                <p>“They want to assure you of their loyalty to the constitutional system.”</p>
                <p>I said: “That's wonderful.” They came over to my house. Two or three of my staff
                    were also there. The Chiefs of all the Services came in full dress uniform. They
                    had a formal document they all signed (the president, who had just taken over,
                    also signed it) stating their total loyalty to the Constitution. I made a few
                    remarks, thanked them for their courtesy and said I would report this meeting to
                    Washington immediately.</p>
                <p>I think that gives about as good an example as any to say that the roots of
                    democracy were firmly implanted in the Dominican Republic. I would never be so
                    foolish as to say that a hurricane couldn't uproot them, but it's going to take
                    a pretty, pretty strong wind to have the country revert to any kind of a
                    military dictatorship.</p>
                <p>Now, as for Jorge Blanco himself, the president. I guess this was the second week
                    I was there, a few days after the funeral took place for President Guzm�n. Tom
                    Enders, who was assistant secretary of state for Latin America, telephoned me
                    and said: “Look, we'd like to have Jorge Blanco, the fellow who's going to be
                    president, come up to Washington and see the president. The president would like
                    to discuss Central America. And maybe the president-elect, might like to go up
                    to Congress and see some people.” Remember he wasn't even president.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before he was inaugurated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, he was still president-elect. The fellow that took his place was
                    of the same party, but a political opponent of his within the party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the vice president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Who was now president, for this 45 days. And so here we were asking
                    Jorge Blanco to leave, go to Washington as president-elect with a 45-day
                    president in office. I thought this was quite something. I didn't know him at
                    all then, and had to persuade him to do this. He did it on one condition. He
                    said: “If you will go with me. I have to do it that way. Otherwise, the people
                    won't understand.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will think that you're getting him out of the way, in
                        order to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Or that it really is urgent, for the President of the United States
                    wants to see me, etc.</p>
                <p>And so I was out at the airfield. I walked across the tarmac and flew to
                    Washington with him, and was with him on all his calls. He then established a
                    very good relationship, before he ever became president, with our president and
                    with our leadership because he supported us in Central America.</p>
                <p>At one point I said: “I think, Mr. President, that this could stand you in good
                    stead in the future.” And it certainly did. U.S. assistance when I arrived there
                    or the year before, was $30 million a year, and increased to $160 million just
                    before I left in August, 1985. He deserved every bit of it for the help he gave
                    us on the Caribbean Basin initiative legislation and on Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>On Nicaragua there's an interesting story he told me, and I think this can now be
                    told. He did some very helpful things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Anderson, I'm afraid we were cut off in the
                        middle of a sentence there, but can you recapture where you were and
                        continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: I'll try, Tully. I believe I was just starting to talk about some very
                    valuable things that President Jorge Blanco did, with regard to helping us in
                    Nicaragua. He used to see the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, earlier a Catholic
                    priest, if I'm not mistaken. President Jorge Blanco told me of one particular
                    meeting with him, to try and convince him of the intentions of the United States
                    with regard to Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>He told the foreign minister he was absolutely convinced that the United States
                    had no intention whatsoever of invading and occupying Nicaragua. Jorge said to
                    the foreign minister: “And I'll tell you why I'm telling you this. You may
                    remember that the United States came into my country militarily in 1965. They're
                    not there now, and they left after a year. If they had not come in, I would not
                    be here today, facing you as a freely elected president of a democratic nation.
                    Believe me. If you could transform your policy so you could become a democratic
                    nation, you wouldn't have anything to worry about as far as the Americans are
                    concerned.” I thought this was quite a statement to make.</p>
                <p>One other point on the military intervention of President Johnson in 1965. We
                    should remember, I think, very clearly, that when the Marines went in then, it
                    was not like previous interventions in the Dominican Republic to take over the
                    country so we could collect taxes, and create a Trujillo. We unwittingly created
                    Trujillo. You know that. Our military trained him and thought he was just a
                    great fellow.</p>
                <p>I'm going to make a statement now which I'm prepared to argue with anybody. Our
                    military intervention in 1965 was strictly limited to separate two warring
                    factions, and to prevent deaths. There was a line we wanted to protect in Santo
                    Domingo. We didn't go all over the country. That intervention was probably one
                    of the most successful foreign-policy actions we have taken since World War II,
                    with regard to the use of military force.</p>
                <p>Why do I say that? Because today you have probably the most solid democracy in
                    the entire area. That would not have taken place but for this very limited,
                    precise action, and an incredibly skillful, patient effort by Ellsworth Bunker.
                    The 20th anniversary of the our intervention took place when I was in the
                    Dominican Republic. There were a few reports that communists, leftists and
                    assorted radicals were going to stage huge demonstrations. My security officer
                    was battening down all the hatches. He was having a fit. I wasn't that
                    concerned, personally, nor was my DCM, although we noted that the biggest
                    university was just down the road and was very leftist and radical and had
                    students who would demonstrate about anything at the drop of a hat.</p>
                <p>So we went to work that morning and were waiting for all hell to break loose.
                    Finally, around 9:00 or 9:30 in the morning, about 20 or 25 bedraggled students
                    came walking down the road with a few placards protesting our military invasion
                    20 years ago. The security officer came and told me about this. I said: “Well,
                    that's great. Let's go down and see them.”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>And the security officer was having a fit. “You can't do that.”</p>
                <p>I asked: “There are about 20 of them out there, or something, right?”</p>
                <p>He said: “Yes.” I went out on the street, talked to them, and invited them in for
                    coffee. That was the demonstration marking the 20th anniversary of our military
                    intervention. The Dominicans themselves know the value of that intervention. I
                    thought that this little historical footnote would be of interest. I haven't had
                    anybody really dispute me when I cite this is an example of, perhaps, the most
                    successful political use of military force, since World War II.</p>
                <p>One point about Jorge Blanco and Ellsworth Bunker. It has to do with the
                    inauguration of Jorge Blanco in August 1982. There was a gentleman who was going
                    to be the head of the delegation for the United States, named James Watt, who
                    was the Secretary of Interior. I had earlier made a number of recommendations on
                    who should be on the delegation and who should head it. I had suggested
                    Ellsworth Bunker as an ideal head. the selection became very political. The ball
                    was being thrown around in Washington on who should head the delegation.</p>
                <p>When James Watt was picked to head the delegation, I telephoned Washington—I will
                    not say to whom—and said: “I will not be present.” I was a brand-new ambassador
                    who had just arrived. I said: “Forget it. This is most inappropriate. He has
                    nothing whatsoever to do with this country. It isn't going to mean anything. And
                    he is very controversial in the United States already. I don't want to be
                    around.”</p>
                <p>Fortunately for the Dominicans as well as me, he became ill and couldn't come.
                    Ellsworth Bunker, my original suggestion was made the head of the delegation and
                    he came. Jorge Blanco hadn't seen him since they were sitting across the table
                    that I mentioned to you before, negotiating back in '65 and '66.</p>
                <p>The night before the inauguration, Jorge invited the American delegation to come
                    over to the palace. The whole delegation marched over, and I led them into
                    Jorge's office. I stood aside, because I knew I didn't have to do much by way of
                    introduction. There were Jorge Blanco, the former negotiator for his country's
                    independence, who was going to head his country, and Ellsworth Bunker, the man
                    who made this possible.</p>
                <p>Jorge Blanco saw Ellsworth, rushed up to him, threw his arms around him and
                    started to cry. It was a very moving and touching scene. I can't think of a
                    better person that the United States could have had to be the head of our
                    delegation. I mean, Tom Enders was on the delegation. Russ Doherty was there,
                    the labor leader, who knows Latin America well. They had some good people on it.
                    Bill Middendorf was another one; he and his wife came down. But this
                    relationship between Bunker and Jorge Blanco was such a precious thing to
                    watch.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Now, a first that took place between the United States and the Dominican
                    Republic. This is hard to believe, and I couldn't believe it for a long time. It
                    was a visit that Jorge Blanco made later on. When I was fighting to get some
                    kind of an official visit, I found out that despite the fact that we had had
                    diplomatic relations since about 1890 there had never been an official visit, or
                    a state visit, by a Dominican chief of state to the United States.</p>
                <p>Some people said: “Yeah, but Trujillo used to come up here.” Well, he might have
                    come up—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it wasn't—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No official or State visit. So I used this with the White House, and I
                    kept pointing out the help we were getting from Jorge on the CBI and Central
                    America. And so, lo and behold, it was made not an official, but a state visit.
                    I wasn't even pushing for a state visit, which, as you know so well, Tully, is
                    much harder to pull off. We had a most successful visit with President Reagan.
                    He came to know Bush very well. This first state visit, or official visit of any
                    kind, was another accomplishment of Jorge Blanco, which was so helpful in our
                    relationships with his country.</p>
                <p>Do you remember when I was down there, we went into Grenada?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Eugenia Charles, who was the Prime Minister of Dominica, came up here
                    on behalf of the Eastern Caribbean states, to request the United States' help,
                    because they didn't have enough forces to correct this very anarchic situation
                    that was going on in Grenada.</p>
                <p>I was awakened early on the morning of the invasion by Washington, and was asked
                    to go over and tell the president just before it was going to happen, and seek
                    his understanding. So I got word to his staff and I was over seeing him at 7:00
                    in the morning. I told him about it, our action in Grenada that would soon take
                    place, and why we were doing it. He looked at me and said: “Look, you obviously
                    know that I can't come out publicly and praise this. I'm not going to say
                    anything. I'm just going to remain silent. But I think you know the way I feel.”
                    There was no criticism of our activity from him.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>That same day, a prominent political leader named Pena Gomez of the same party as
                    Jorge Blanco—he's black, very active, very dynamic, charismatic, but who has
                    some very strong views on certain subjects—was coming over for a one-on-one
                    lunch. By that time, the news was out that we were all in Grenada and things
                    were coming under control. Pena stormed through the door, and I said: “Oh, I can
                    see we're going to have a nice lunch, aren't we, Pena.” He proceeded to upbraid
                    me for the invasion. I went through the scenario with him in detail. He said:
                    “You cannot go around invading these countries. Who do you think you are?”</p>
                <p>I said: “We went in at the request of others to help return the country to
                    peace.”</p>
                <p>When Pena countered with: “That isn't good enough,” I became exasperated with
                    him, and said: “All right, Pena, I'll tell you what. Except for Cuba, the
                    Dominican Republic is the largest nation in the Caribbean in area and in
                    population, including Jamaica and all the other English-speaking nations.”</p>
                <p>Pena: “So?”</p>
                <p>I: “You don't disagree there was an anarchic situation in Grenada that had to be
                    taken care of. And you didn't like the Cubans there, right?”</p>
                <p>Pena: “Right.”</p>
                <p>I: “Well if you people could assume your responsibilities in the Caribbean,
                    seeing that you have a few airplanes and some other assets, maybe Prime Minister
                    Eugenia Charles could have come to you and asked the Dominican Republic to go in
                    and help them. But I guess they felt that you probably would say no. If you had
                    taken a more positive attitude, and assumed a leadership role, maybe we would
                    not have had to play a role in Grenada.”</p>
                <p>That shook him. He said: “I have to admit that you have something here.” We
                    remained very close friends. But I thought that the Jorge Blanco reaction to
                    Grenada was something that ought to be noted.</p>
                <p>Now, I don't propose to go on any more with the Dominican Republic. If you have
                    anything in mind, on the Dominican Republic or anything else where I might be
                    helpful, you have only to ask.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to bring this record up to date a little bit, what is
                        the present status in the leadership of the Dominican Republic? Is it still
                        as hopeful as it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's an important question. The president is elected every four
                    years. There was an election in May, '86. Believe it or not, Joaquin Balaguer
                    was reelected, again, for the fourth time. He's totally blind.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bit over the hill, I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He is quite old. He's in his eighties. He hasn't changed his thinking.
                    The thing that became apparent when he took over in his fourth term, having been
                    out of office for eight years, was that he didn't realize that the country has
                    progressed economically, and that there is now a very important, burgeoning
                    middle class which is the real key of the nation, the real kernel of the
                    nation's future. He just ignores this.</p>
                <p>He still likes to go out on the weekends, go into an area and give small bits of
                    land to peasants. That's the caudillo approach that he has. That's economically
                    a disaster. You take large land holdings and divide them up into little, tiny
                    plots owned by different people and you're not going to get little economic
                    production out of them.</p>
                <p>Another thing that he's done, which disappoints me about as much as anything. He
                    wants to build buildings just so people remember him; he's printing money to do
                    it. Jorge Blanco didn't print a note. One governor in the Center Bank tried to
                    print some notes and he was fired. That's why Jorge Blanco was able to conclude
                    agreements with the IMF and the World Bank. That's why he was able to get a lot
                    more aid, because he showed himself a serious leader. That was great.</p>
                <p>Balaguer is just the opposite. Inflation is now running rampant. The current
                    tragedy is there is an election, Tully, next month, in May. There are two
                    candidates. Balaguer is running again! The other principal candidate is Juan
                    Bosch, a Marxist-Leninist, very leftist, just about as old as Balaguer. He can
                    see, at least.</p>
                <p>This is a most unfortunate development for the Dominican Republic, and this is
                    the one thing that I'm unhappy about. I talked to you earlier about the
                    democratic evolution and the fact that the roots of democracy are getting
                    imbedded in the Dominican Republic. I feel that Balaguer has had a stranglehold
                    on the country. As he won't nominate a successor to his party, others don't wish
                    to fight it. There are some very competent younger people who are coming up, who
                    cannot really take part in the political life of the country the way they
                    should. If this goes on this way, this structure may start to weaken. That's
                    what disappoints me. But I still don't feel that there's a military coup in the
                    offing, or anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not hopeless, yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, but it's not a healthy situation. Does that answer the
                    question?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it does, very much, indeed, although it doesn't
                        leave one exactly thrilled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, now do you have any comments on the generality of the United States policy
                    and handling of Latin America? Has it become more sophisticated and matured? Do
                    you think we are generally on the right track these days, or is there a
                    peculiarity about our relationship with Latin America which needs to be
                    corrected? What are your general observations on what American policy should be,
                    and American conduct should be, diplomatically, towards Latin America?</p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Let me go about it this way. After I finish this comment, I want you to
                    remind me to talk about the Foreign Service in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. In a way, it was an implicit part of my
                        question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I am very pleased with the way that the Bush Administration is handling
                    our Latin American policy. I think that President Bush—and I know that he
                    recognizes this, because he and I have talked about it in the past—recognizes
                    the necessity to consult with Latin American leaders before the United States
                    goes in and tries to take a political or other action.</p>
                <p>Let me give you a very explicit example. As you know, the Organization of
                    American States, the OAS, has long been considered a virtually useless
                    organization, because of United States dominance of the organization in the eyes
                    of our Latin American friends. They, therefore, will not allow controversial
                    political subjects to be discussed or acted on, in the OAS forum. They're all
                    there, huddled together, virtually against the United States. That's one of the
                    reasons the OAS has not been very successful.</p>
                <p>Now President Bush comes into office. They had these elections in Panama that, as
                    we all know, were a total fraud. What did President Bush do about that? He did
                    something that is almost without precedent, and I give him full marks here, and
                    this is indicative of the way I believe he wants to try and handle our relations
                    with Latin America.</p>
                <p>We had our own views about what we might like to do, regarding these elections I
                    don't think it was military action at all but rather certain political actions.
                    So how do you go about trying to accomplish what you would like to see done? You
                    talk privately with the key leaders of Latin America first, before you say
                    anything publicly. The result was amazing. Carlos Andr�s P�rez, the president of
                    Venezuela, was in the lead here. But this highly controversial political subject
                    was discussed in the OAS. The United States was not in the lead in the
                    discussions. It was three or four Latin American leaders that took the lead. The
                    U.S. would then support their positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The result was unusual. A commission was formed, headed by the secretary general
                    of the OAS, and three or four members, and was charged to go to Panama and
                    investigate what happened. Now it's very true that they went down, investigated,
                    came back condemned what had taken place. The OAS then voted to condemn it. But,
                    as expected didn't vote for action against a fellow Latin American country.</p>
                <p>That's all right, as far as I'm concerned, as a starter. Through this action, the
                    president was able to move the OAS back into the political ball game. So now if
                    a subject dealing with the American continent comes up, it doesn't have to go
                    into the U.N., where you face all sorts of other problems. The OAS can now be a
                    channel for action. This is why that was an excellent move.</p>
                <p>Now, you could very well say, “Well, what about the invasion of Panama?” Well, I
                    personally feel that it was a correct move. There was no choice but to do that.
                    I am not privy to the inner counsels of our government now, but I would be
                    willing to wager a bet that there was prior consultation, quietly, with certain
                    leaders. I just feel it in my bones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been, yes, obviously; or you'd have had
                        much more criticism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I can tell you that, privately, Carlos Andr�s P�rez had no problem with
                    it. I also noticed one other thing. The president of Peru, you may remember,
                    came out after the invasion and excoriated our president saying: “This is the
                    most imperialistic move I've ever seen.” Of course, he has an election right
                    now, (and I don't think he's going to win, either). But you know, with an
                    election going on; he had to say something like this. He also said: “If you
                    think I'm going to go to this drug summit in Cartagena, with that president
                    who's invaded one of our fellow Latin American countries, you're crazy.” He was
                    the first one to meet him at Cartagena; threw his arms around him, cooperated
                    fully. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>So you see why I think that the way the president's handling our relations with
                    Latin America is quite different than before. The way, for example, he comported
                    himself at the drug summit. He didn't go down there the way, probably, some of
                    his predecessors might have, and start telling them how they should do
                    things.</p>
                <p>First, he went down and said: “This is a two-pronged problem. There's a supply
                    side and demand side. The demand side is my fault, my responsibility. We have to
                    do better. I'd like to hear any thoughts you have.”</p>
                <p>Then he said: “The supply side is your problem.” Then he didn't start saying all
                    the things that they weren't doing right. He said: “Now, we're trying to help
                    you now. Is this help useful? Is there any other way that you feel we, together,
                    can try and work on the supply-side problem?” Approached it in a collegial, not
                    dictatorial way. I think that that is a very good approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>He saw the president-elect of Brazil two or three times up here, before he took
                    over. I don't know whether this poor guy's going to be able to make it or not.
                    He has a handful of problems that he will have to work on. Our President's
                    concern about them, and the attention he gave to the President-elect should be
                    helpful.</p>
                <p>There's a change here and I look forward to the president continuing to try and
                    work things out with Latin America. The initiative of trying to conclude a free
                    trade pact with Mexico, the way we did with Canada is another indication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you said you might also have some thoughts, though,
                        on our diplomatic representation in South America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes. You and I have been in this business a long time. Having served on
                    five different continents, and therefore having served in a number of bureaus,
                    and especially having been the spokesman of the State Department, where I had to
                    deal with each bureau every day for my daily press conferences, I have felt that
                    the staffing in Latin America was the weakest that we have. It was ingrown. Most
                    of our career people in this area have big blinders on. They're very happy,
                    they're contented, because in the old days they'd enter the Service, get a Latin
                    American assignment, and just stay in the area for their whole career. One
                    reason they liked it is that there were more countries, so they could end up as
                    an ambassador, hopefully. Other's in the bureau weren't really interested in
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>One has to realize that unless you have an area where there are real problems,
                    the national leadership isn't going to think about it. The Congress isn't going
                    to think about it. Therefore, your top officers are not going to want to spend
                    their career dealing with issues that are of no concern to anybody but
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>I'm not trying to be—what should I say—critical of these officers. If I had
                    started out in the Latin American Bureau, as a young fellow, and all my
                    colleagues that started out in the Latin American office were staying in Latin
                    America—and you get to know your friends as you go from assignment to
                    assignment—I might have ended up like that. I kind of doubt this though, because
                    my intellectual pursuits were broader than just Latin America. In fact, I never
                    was excited about Latin America that much, because the area did not deal with
                    the major problems in the world affecting the United States, especially before
                    Castro came into power.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>When I was spokesman of the State Department, I'd have to go to each bureau to
                    obtain suggested answers to thequestions each day. From the Latin American
                    Bureau I couldn't get straight answers; they were afraid of the press. They
                    didn't want to answer. I would say: “You have to answer, or I've got to answer.
                    If you can't give me one, I'll get it and I'll tell you what I'm going to say
                    after I've said it. You can listen to what I'm going to tell the press.” It used
                    to make me absolutely livid.</p>
                <p>When Bill Rogers took over under Kissinger as Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Latin America, before he went up as Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, it was
                    a different story. It was wonderful. He came from the outside. I would have to
                    go to him every morning to get answers to questions, and some were pretty
                    piddling. But I couldn't get it out of his public affairs people or the desk
                    officers, or the office directors lots of times. They just didn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the history of the bureau, I think, is that the
                        top ranks of government, the White House and so on, have not always been
                        that interested in that bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, that's what I was saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But a lot of businessmen have been very interested. And
                        the pressure has sometimes come in, I think, through the business community,
                        who had specific interests there. I wonder if that has an effect on things
                        in some way; that they get a slightly warped view. Anyway, it's a very
                        interesting problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I am sure that the American business community—particularly in the
                    past, when you had W.R. Grace and Company and some of these giants—I'm sure they
                    had an influence. And they're the only ones, probably, in America that cared at
                    all, about Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, United Fruit, the copper companies, all of
                        those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes! ITT was down in Chile. Yes. But this did not attract the top
                    people in our service. You know that yourself. You were in European affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's accidental in my case. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I'm not saying that none of them were any good, at all. It's just that
                    their optic was limited, because their entire careers were focused on this
                    hemisphere. And, you know, there are things going on in Europe and Africa and
                    other places that have an effect on Latin America. And they wouldn't be
                    interested.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>They had this one program that I did approve of very much, called the GLOP. I
                    don't know whether you ever heard of that or not. The GLOP program meant that if
                    you were a specialist in an area every so many years you had to serve out of the
                    area for at least one tour of duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: You know, the European boys loved Europe. This is one of the reasons
                    that this came. Get these guys over to Africa. Let them get their feet dirty.
                    But also for Latin America. Get them out and let the blinders be removed. And
                    then they'd be tremendous officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I like to get people to talk just a
                        minute or two about is what they did after they retired; because you, of all
                        people, and many other people, have done some very important and interesting
                        things in retirement. And I think it's interesting, historically, to report
                        that. And I wonder if you'd like to just take two or three minutes to say
                        what you have been doing and what your future objectives are, if you have
                        any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, I have been very active since I retired. Unfortunately, I lost my
                    wife very unexpectedly, six months after I retired in December, '85.
                    Particularly after that, I just had to get going and do things. I think I'm
                    getting out of the trauma now because of being active. I'm busy in consulting
                    work. A couple of law officers here call me up, and they have a problem, and
                    they ask me if I can help out. The consulting firm here is a friend of mine I
                    mentioned earlier, I think, Donald Agger. I help him on occasion. I have a
                    retainership with a couple of corporations, that keep me busy. I was just made a
                    director of the Atlantic Council of the U.S.A., which thrills me very much.</p>
                <p>And I'm working now with Paul Nitze and Tim Stanley—Dr. Timothy Stanley—to try
                    and, maybe, come up urgently with a paper on our objectives in Europe and
                    elsewhere in the world, in light of this rapidly changing world? I don't think
                    we really have thought it through. And then once we've figured that out, then
                    how are we going to fulfill these objectives?</p>
                <p>I chaired a meeting the other day at the Atlantic Council, and the subject came
                    up of what organizations can the U.S. use in order to make sure our influence is
                    brought to bear in the evolving East-West picture. I was disappointed in the
                    discussion as it called for yet another grouping, and so stated at the meeting.
                    Joe Fowler, the ex-secretary of the Treasury, was there, and said: “Bob, I
                    couldn't agree more.” Because people were searching for a new organization;
                    create a new bureaucracy, a new secretariat. The trouble is, we have too damned
                    many organizations now. There are plenty of organizations. Let's use them more
                    efficiently to suit this changing world of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that ought to be very fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I was asked to be a trustee of the Burns International Center, that's
                    attached to the University of South Carolina; Bill Brock is the chairman of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the best men who ever served in government, Bill
                        Brock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think he's wonderful. And it's a very international board. It has
                    many Europeans that I've known for years. Peter Carrington is on it; and Stevie
                    Davignon, who's president of the Soci�t� General, Villier Pagniez, who used to
                    be chairman of Renault and Mitterrand's ambassador here when he first was
                    elected president. And I enjoy working with them. And I'm trying to help out on
                    the Caribbean and European matters.</p>
                <p>I don't know, Tully. I have more than enough to do, I can assure you. And little
                    things keep coming up daily. The main thing I'd like to make sure I am able to
                    do this year is to go to the French Open Tennis Tournament. And I've been
                    invited to Wimbledon again. And I want to do those two things, come hell or high
                    water. I hope my business doesn't prevent me from doing it.</p>
                <p>I'm very active and I think that Foreign Service people have so much to offer,
                    really. If they just can have confidence in themselves and make themselves
                    known, particularly if they've dealt with American business. I always did that
                    as an ambassador. My top priority was to help American business abroad. That is
                    why I was offered many of the things I am doing today. I was helpful to American
                    business abroad in the Service, and this became known to corporations back here.
                    You would be surprised how well the bamboo telegraph works in our industrial
                    world. And that is a thing that all Foreign Service people should try and
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's certainly one of our major objectives. Well,
                        thank you very much, indeed.</hi>
