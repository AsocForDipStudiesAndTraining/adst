                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>Today is May 11, 1995, and this is an interview with Robert Rackmales.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob, to start this off I wonder if you could tell me a bit
                        about when and where you were born, and a little about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was born in Baltimore in 1937. My father at the time of my birth had
                    a small tobacco store in East Baltimore not too far from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
                    I went to public schools in Baltimore. My father eventually went bankrupt and
                    went to work for the Social Security Administration. I went to public schools
                    and to Johns Hopkins. I lived at home until graduating from Hopkins in 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your family was part of the German migration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Jewish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The German Jewish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: No, East European. My grandparents both came from what would now be
                    probably Belorussia, but in the Jewish villages in that part of the world. We
                    don't have a lot of family records going back so I couldn't pinpoint even the
                    names of the towns that they came from. I guess our best known relative was my
                    paternal grandfather's nephew, that is his brother's son who is known as Kirk
                    Douglas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, he was a movie actor. Danielovich was his name,
                        or something like that. When you were at Johns Hopkins what was your
                        field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: History, primarily European history. My faculty advisor was Hans
                    Gatzke, who later went on to Yale. He was a German immigrant who had left
                    Germany in 1936 because he was appalled by Nazism. He taught first at Williams
                    and later at Johns Hopkins and then finally at Yale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of this point you towards the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, particularly my getting a Fulbright after finishing at Johns
                    Hopkins and going to Mainz for a year as a Fulbright student. Then I went on
                    from there to Harvard where I did a year of graduate work, but decided that
                    research was not for me. So I became a civil servant eventually when the
                    Department of the Army Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, and then took the Foreign
                    Service exam two years after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Johns Hopkins when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression when you were a Fulbright scholar
                        at Mainz of the system there? This is your first real look at Germany,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was a period of considerable optimism about the economic prospects
                    for Germany. But there was a lot of anxiety and concern about Soviet intentions
                    while I was in Germany. In 1958 there were scares over Berlin, and whether there
                    was going to be another war over Berlin. And people were really quite anxious
                    about that. I would say that that detracted from what would otherwise have been
                    a feeling of confidence about the future based on the fact that Germany had come
                    back so strongly economically. I remember my first conversation with a Foreign
                    Service official, as it turned out it was a German FSN, because I called wanting
                    to get on a tour bus that the university was sponsoring that went by road to
                    Berlin. And, of course, you had to go through the GDR, and you had to show your
                    travel document. At that period the government was discouraging Americans from
                    doing that. The FSN I spoke to said, we can't take any responsibility for you,
                    we prefer you not show your travel documents. So, being the cautious prudent
                    type that I was, didn't go on that particular trip. I did get to Berlin on a
                    trip sponsored by the Fulbright commission where they flew all of us for a
                    meeting, and that was for me a very moving experience being in that place at
                    that time. I remember seeing Willy Brandt who was coming back from an overseas
                    trip landing at the airport while we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back, and you were at Harvard for a year, was
                        that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this pointed towards a Ph.D.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I thought so at the time, and I found that the life style didn't
                    appeal to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just trying to capture some of this because part of this
                        is, who are these Foreign Service people. How did you view the academic life
                        style as you saw it at Harvard, which, I guess is the epitome of the life
                        style. You're in the belly of the beast there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I had great admiration for most of my fellow students and the faculty.
                    This is a very, very bright group of people. But it became fairly clear to me
                    after three or four months of intensive reading, research, and writing, that a
                    life devoted primarily to that didn't have the degree of interaction with
                    others, and what, to use Foreign Service jargon, we call operational
                    responsibilities. I would have a tendency to get too Ivy towerist, too caught up
                    in just the reading. So I decided, why force myself into something that didn't
                    seem to be giving me the kind of pleasures and satisfactions that I wanted. I
                    tried, as I mentioned, being a management analyst for a while, a specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Department of the Army, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, and Edgewood Arsenal, which is, I guess still is, I
                    haven't kept up with it, but at that time it was the headquarters for the
                    chemical part of what used to be called the Chemical Corps. Then after the war
                    they called it the Chemical Biological Radiological Agency. The biological part
                    was in Fort Detrick, and the chemical part was working up nerve gases, and other
                    chemical agents, was at Edgewood Arsenal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Edgewood Arsenal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: If you drive out the old route 40 from Baltimore heading east towards
                    New York it's about 25 miles from Baltimore. It's less well known than Aberdeen
                    Proving Ground which is just beyond Edgewood Arsenal. In fact the two
                    installations may have since been combined into one. Aberdeen was the testing
                    ground for munitions, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I started as a budget analyst. It was under a program which existed in
                    those years, maybe still does, to bring in management interns, and train them in
                    the major administrative fields. In my case I started with budget and moved to
                    management. Just backtracking for a second, you asked earlier about whether my
                    studies at Hopkins, and my year in Mainz had awakened my interest in the Foreign
                    Service. But actually I had first thought about it when I was much younger than
                    that and had read a lot about the Foreign Service when I was even in junior high
                    school. I had thought about going to Georgetown School of Foreign Service, that
                    was before going to Johns Hopkins, and thinking that I would want to pursue an
                    academic career. Anyway, those interests which had been percolating in the
                    background came to the foreground and one of the things that stimulated it was
                    reading the Herter Commission Report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Herter Commission Report
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Herter Commission Report, I think, was issued in '61 or '62. It
                    was one of a long series of commissions to study the future of the Foreign
                    Service. Anyway, it rang a bell, because the Herter Commission in looking at
                    what the Foreign Service was being called upon increasingly to do, came to the
                    conclusion that they needed operational people, people who could run programs,
                    people who knew management, people with administrative skills, and not just
                    people who had studied foreign affairs. So, with my background, and with my
                    recent experience as a management analyst, and I felt that program management
                    was something I could take on successfully. In 1962 I passed the Foreign Service
                    written exam. In the oral exam which was a lot more flexible in those days than
                    the current one is, I packaged myself, as a person who fit the criteria the
                    Herter Commission said that the State Department should be looking for, and I
                    guess the members of the panel agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for this, how did the panel operate
                        when you did it? Do you remember any of the things that you were given to
                        deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was an entirely different from today's system. As I recall they
                    asked first about my views on some current issues. Eichmann had just been
                    grabbed by the Israelis...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adolph Eichmann who had was one of the prime Nazi managers
                        of the holocaust.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. So I was asked in some detail about my views of the
                    implications of kidnappings on foreign soil. I don't recall what I responded,
                    but it must not have been too bad. They asked me geographical questions, which I
                    did very well on. I mentioned that I had just been out in Davenport, Iowa on a
                    trip. So they asked me to name all the states that bordered on Iowa, which I
                    thought was a real softball since I had just been there. There were several
                    questions on American history, and I flubbed the Missouri Compromise. I just
                    couldn't remember what the content of the Missouri Compromise was. And they told
                    me afterwards that that had nearly done me in. But the questions that got at my
                    suitability for the Foreign Service were almost all geared towards the role of
                    the administrative officer because of the way that I had packaged myself. How do
                    you view the role of the administrative officer? What do you think the
                    administrative does, or should do, and that sort of thing? Again, they must have
                    been fairly satisfied with that answer to compensate for my having missed the
                    Missouri Compromise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in 1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: '63, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into a training course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, not immediately. I came in in August, and the next A-100 class
                    was in September, so they put me on the Canadian desk to help out. That was a
                    very good introduction. I got to write a portion of a speech for the Secretary
                    of State to deliver in Ottawa. He actually used my words. Our office teletype
                    transmitted the address that he had just given, and I was proud to see the
                    language that I had written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to capture the times, you took the A-100
                        course, that's the junior officer course, that was about three months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. It started in September. We were in A-100 when President
                    Kennedy was assassinated. And we finished in December. One unusual aspect of our
                    class is that because of a budgetary crisis which they had even back in 1963,
                    there was no travel money. I had been optimistic about getting assigned to
                    Helsinki. Instead a grim faced coordinator of the course came out on the day
                    assignments were announced and said, “We're very sorry, we're embarrassed about
                    this, but there are no travel funds. So we're assigning you to the passport
                    office for about eight months until the end of the fiscal year.” But anyway,
                    from January until July or August we were all sent out to the various passport
                    offices around the country.</p>

                        consist of? Can you characterize them at this period. This is the very end
                        of the Kennedy era, this group that's on that wave of enthusiasm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had both State and USIA officers. The group was about 80% male, and
                    20% female. A diverse group geographically...one of the things the Herter
                    Commission had emphasized was geographical diversity. The ages ranged from 22,
                    just graduated, to early 30s. I recall being impressed by the wide range of
                    skills and the strong sense of dedication and optimism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the passport office during this
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was sent to the Passport Office at Rockefeller Center in New York.
                    Beginning in the spring it's a huge passport mill. You had about 30 seconds to
                    process each applicant. You were even told to skip administering the oath. They
                    had sent eight of us up there, and from January until April, there was not much
                    to do, so we would sit in the back and shoot the breeze. One of the games we had
                    was flipping paper clips up into the light fixtures. Francis Knight was still
                    the head of the Passport Office and she was scheduled to visit the passport
                    office. We, the FSOs, could see the civil servants get very up-tight over her
                    visit. We were much more relaxed. At one point the Director asked the FSOs to
                    wash the walls. That split the group badly. One group said, “Absolutely not.
                    This is demeaning, it's not why we were hired.” Others said, “This place is a
                    mess and why shouldn't we help clean it up.” Whatever actually happened, the
                    visit passed uneventfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Francis Knight was quite a character, she and Ruth Shipley
                        together more or less ran the passport office in succession for about 40
                        years or something like that. Did you get the feeling that Francis Knight
                        was a power to be reckoned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. She had a forceful personality. I had the impression she was not
                    a nice person particularly, but I didn't really have any meaningful contact with
                    her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first post was Lagos, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in Nigeria, and you were there from '64 to '66. How did
                        that sit with you being assigned there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was a good assignment from a personal and professional standpoint.
                    From a personal standpoint, I met my wife in Lagos, we got married midway
                    through my tour. From a professional standpoint, with the coup in January 1966
                    that overthrew the civilian government, it was a dramatic, exciting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we'll come back to it. Let's talk first about when
                        you arrived in 1964, what was the situation in Lagos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The city itself had a poor reputation although not nearly as bad as
                    the deservedly awful reputation that it has had in later years. You did not have
                    in those days the level of crime, certainly not crime directed at westerners.
                    Areas of the city where American embassy people lived were much more pleasant
                    than I had expected. Yes, downtown had open sewers, and you noticed smells that
                    might be a little disagreeable, but I found it a vibrant, interesting place to
                    be. I remember coming back from a trip to Kinshasa which struck me as a dead,
                    morose city compared to Lagos. I found Lagos an exciting place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived it was what? A fairly full blown
                        democracy, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There was a civilian elected government. It was closer to a fully
                    functioning democracy than has existed since. The thing that did it in though,
                    the same thing that did in Yugoslavia, was that politics became purely ethnic.
                    The political parties turned into engines for promoting nationalism or
                    tribalism, whichever word you want to use. Tribalism seems to be used more in an
                    African context, nationalism in European context, but it's the same thing. I
                    remember one close exposure to this phenomenon. I had gotten to know the head of
                    the Nigerian Timber Association who was British. He took me to some of the saw
                    mills, so we got to meet with and talk to some of the workers in the midst of
                    the 1965 election campaign. Their passions were so high that we were literally
                    threatened with machetes and forced to say of course we were supportive of their
                    ethnic party. These were regional elections in the western region, and I was
                    given the job of following those closely. I was the only one working full time
                    on these regional elections. I wrote a long evaluation just before the election
                    which went in and was commended by the Department, but my final conclusion got
                    watered down by the embassy. My conclusion was that these elections were going
                    to trigger large scale violence. The embassy fudged it because we were
                    supporting Nigerian democracy, we didn't want to make it seem as if this was a
                    country in trouble. So the prospect for violence was played down. In fact, large
                    scale violence did break out, and eventually led to the coup that took place
                    about six months later that overthrew the government. It was an early exposure,
                    both to the force of tribalism/nationalism, and also to the unfortunate
                    reluctance of some embassies to give Washington bad news.</p>

                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a strong tendency, and it doesn't always reflect you
                        might say the considered thinking of the observers on the spot. Well, you
                        don't know where this news is going to go for one thing. If you do say this,
                        you become known as a doomsayer. It's much easier to paper it over. Who ran
                        the embassy when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The ambassador was named Elbert Matthews, known as Bert. I had a lot
                    of respect for him, he was a gentleman. I was able to spend several months as
                    his executive assistant when his executive assistant was medevaced. I served
                    approximately six months in each of the embassy sections, and I was grateful for
                    that. It resulted in changing my primary interest from administration to
                    political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I found political work intellectually more exciting and challenging.
                    Looking back at the end of my tour, I was proud that what I had done in terms of
                    analyzing the election, and other events resulted in predictions that were
                    pretty close to the mark. It was gratifying to have more access to the front
                    office, sensing that I was working on issues that were of more concern to the
                    senior levels of the embassy. I also enjoyed the admin work that I did. I didn't
                    regret the time I spent there. I was put in charge of the motor pool, so that
                    was my first significant supervisory experience because I had about 30 Nigerian
                    drivers. I think that helped later on when I had other supervisory jobs. But I
                    was not as taken with the content of the work, and also my impressions of most
                    of the admin people that I was working with, the Americans in the embassy, is
                    that they seemed to be not as broad gauged. I couldn't see most of them as
                    ambassadors. I guess my perception was that that was not the path that led to
                    the top of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is true. I mean there is a trend to shy away
                        from the administrative side because of this, because of the people in it.
                        They're not as intellectually as fun to be around. What was Matthew's
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: A career man. He had had at least one other embassy in Africa, I think
                    it was one of the other Anglophile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't parachuted into Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: No, he was quite knowledgeable, a real professional, a gentleman.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the embassy deal with this brewing storm that came
                        about and the coup? You mentioned that at least to Washington they were
                        playing down the possibility of major problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, let me tell you about one episode that typifies it. In December
                    of 1965 I was invited to a dinner party. One of the guests there was a young
                    Nigerian engineer who was working for a French oil company doing exploration off
                    the coast of Biafra. He had just graduated from Ibadan University where there
                    had been serious tensions, and even a riot which was ethnically based. And this
                    young engineer who was very open, laid out for me in some detail the fact that
                    there was a group of young Ibo military officers who were plotting a coup to
                    overthrow the civilian regime, because of their anger over the way that Federal
                    troops had treated the Ibo students who were demonstrators in Ibadan. I thought
                    that was a pretty significant bit of information, but still being new to the
                    game the following morning, instead of just sitting down and writing a cable, I
                    went first to the political counselor because I was kind of excited about this.
                    He acted skeptical, and told me to talk to the military attach� and to a member
                    of the station. The reaction of both was, “Oh, we hear rumors all the time,
                    we're not going to bother Washington with this sort of thing.” I was
                    disappointed because I thought I had something and neither the political
                    counselor nor the CIA person thought it was worth reporting. So I didn't. And a
                    few weeks later the coup occurred, and I got an urgent request to tell the
                    ambassador everything I could recall about that engineer. So, in effect, we had
                    warning about the coup, and could have sent something in to Washington which
                    would have at least indicated that the embassy was aware of something. The
                    information was even detailed enough that Washington could have decided whether
                    it was worthwhile to give the civilian government, which we supported, enough
                    information that they could have broken up this group of young officers. The
                    information was specific enough that you could pretty well identify who were the
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the coup play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was bloody, it wiped out not only the top federal leaders, but a
                    number of the regional leaders. It was a trauma. That in turn led to mass
                    killings in the north where there were tens of thousands Ibos who were killed
                    and an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Ibos who fled the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were entrepreneurs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: They were entrepreneurs, but also civil servants, railroad workers,
                    and had lived for generations in the north, because the north had a shortage of
                    workers, and all of these people packed up and there were, of course,
                    heartrending stories. We left in the summer of 1966 at the height of this
                    trauma. Then there was another coup that took place later in the fall. Later the
                    Biafran war took place as a result of all of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the coup happened, how did the embassy react to the
                        initial part of the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It took the embassy totally by surprise despite my earlier (oral)
                    report. What we would now call a crisis management center was set up. We quickly
                    focused on the army command, since the coup plotters had managed to wipe out
                    most of the top civilian leaders. The Federal army structure stayed more intact,
                    so we looked to the army command to establish order. Within a short period of
                    time they had taken the coup plotters into custody. I believe some were executed
                    eventually. Of course ethnic relations went to hell in a hand basket as a result
                    of this. We obviously were also focused on any risk to American citizens. I
                    remember going out to a prison...It was hard traveling around in Lagos for
                    several weeks because you had extremely jumpy military. I remember having a
                    machine gun poked under my nose when I was trying to get around to check up on
                    Americans. We had one young man in jail on drug charges. I remember it was very
                    hard, once this happened, getting to see him. Our policy continued to be that we
                    continued to report the unity of Nigeria. We recognized that in Africa once you
                    start fiddling with the borders then where do you stop. So there was never much
                    sympathy for Ibo separatism except in our consulate in Enugu, which became
                    sympathetic to the Biafran cause. They actually transferred the consul there
                    after he wrote one report too many that was sympathetic to Ibo separatism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: If I remember correctly his name was Bob Barnett(?). He had been the
                    deputy coordinator of our A-100 course so I had known him. He had gone out as
                    principal officer in Enugu just around the same time that I went to Lagos. But
                    he fell afoul of Ambassador Matthews, and he was curtailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy have much contact with the military?
                        Actually you had a couple military, but at the time you were there. First
                        there was the coup while you were there, then the military per se...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, they took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, I'm sure that the attach�s had military to military contacts.
                    I'm sure the military they were talking to didn't know about the coup. If they
                    had, it wouldn't have happened. I can't speak to Ambassador Matthews' ties with
                    the senior military leaders. I think he had known General Ironsi, who was the
                    general who emerged as the first military leader. But I don't know what the
                    nature of their relationship was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in the economic section what was the feeling
                        whither Nigeria at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There was a lot of interest in oil that was clearly...in fact, I think
                    it was in that period that Nigeria first entered the top ten oil exporters. The
                    oil sector was crucial. My own work...I mentioned that I had gotten to know the
                    head of the Nigeria Timber Association, timber was a major industry at that
                    point. In terms of employment it was larger than the oil sector, and it was an
                    important exporter, particularly of hard woods to Europe. I also did a fair
                    amount of commercial work, and got an early exposure to the kind of fraud that
                    Sixty Minutes and others have been covering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty Minutes being an expose TV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Right, but with serious journalists. Although I suspect the scale of
                    it has vastly increased, I certainly saw as a first tour officer doing
                    commercial work how some Nigerian entrepreneurs used tricks and fraudulent
                    schemes, and could see how Americans could easily get caught up if they didn't
                    approach Nigerian businessmen with a great deal of caution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about corruption? Was corruption a way of life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. I saw a lot in my first months as a consular officer.
                    (Incidentally, just to show how much time has passed, I was the only consular
                    officer. We had one American vice consul, and two FSNs, and that was the entire
                    consular section of embassy Lagos. When I went back in the '80s, there were at
                    least a dozen American officers, and many more Nigerians.) Even in that short
                    time, I saw hundreds of fraudulent documents. Sometimes they were patently
                    fraudulent, and sometimes they were a little more sophisticated. You had to
                    check everything extremely carefully. At that point official corruption did not
                    have the profile that it had later on. But I'm sure there was a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any concerns about the Soviet Union? Or were
                        they involved there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. Part of it was through the labor movement. This was the area that
                    seemed to cause the most concern to the embassy. There was a left-leaning labor
                    movement, maybe it was even Marxist. But there had been some Soviet involvement,
                    and our labor attach� was the lead person in trying deal with that particular
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American interests at that time? How would you describe
                        what were American main interests in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Peace Corps was very active there. It was still a new
                    organization, still a lot of idealism. Just before I arrived in Lagos, there was
                    the incident involving Margery Michelmore. You may remember that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the postcard. Could you explain what it is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: This was a young woman, a Peace Corps volunteer, who wrote in a
                    postcard a rather detailed description of the sights and smells of the city, not
                    in a pejorative sense, but just, “this is what it's like.” And since it was in a
                    postcard it got read by a Nigerian postal employee who thought this was
                    outrageous that someone should make comments about the sewers, and the smells.
                    So it got turned into an incident. She had to leave, and it roiled the waters
                    for a little while. I don't think it had a lasting effect. I know the Peace
                    Corps volunteers were still glad to be there. I think most of them were
                    enthusiastic about the experience of being in a dynamic country.</p>
                <p>There was a strong feeling that we had a lot to offer. There was a large AID
                    mission, a large Peace Corps. We thought that Nigeria was going to be a flagship
                    country for all of Africa, the largest sub-Saharan African country by far in
                    terms of population. And on the commercial side, as I mentioned, a lot of
                    interest in the oil resources, and the commercial implications of that. I had
                    certainly asked to go to Nigeria because I thought it was an important country.
                    It still is an important country but I seem to end up in countries that start
                    off as positive role models, and end up as negative role models, Nigeria and
                    Yugoslavia being in that category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Yugoslavia, you left Nigeria in '66, and went
                        right to Serbian training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: When I was back in Washington on my mid-tour trip to get married back
                    in the States I stopped by Personnel and they asked me what I was interested in.
                    They asked if I would be interested in language training and an East European
                    assignment. And I said, yes. Then they asked about which countries I would
                    prefer, and I put Yugoslavia at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I knew it to be a country that politically seemed to be doing more
                    interesting things, and I wanted to observe that first hand. I thought also it
                    would probably be, in terms of quality of life, better to not be in one the
                    hardline countries, where you're more restricted. I think it was mainly though
                    the interest in the experiment in liberal communism, seeing where is it going to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was sucked into it by reading Black Lamb &amp; Grey
                        Falcon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I didn't read that until I had already been assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's by Rebecca West, for the researcher. Could you talk
                        a bit about your experience of learning Serbian because I think this is an
                        indoctrination into the culture of Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, I did learn Serbian in fact although officially it was called
                    Serbo-Croatian. Both of our instructors were Serbs, named Jankovic and
                    Popovic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learned...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: ...the purest Serbian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an aside, I took that course too a couple of years
                        before, and these are unforgettable. What was your impression of these
                        instructors, and what they were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: One of them was a good teacher, Jankovic, I had a lot of respect for
                    him. He was an ideal language teacher, because he didn't force the students to
                    use the language, but he did much more than Popovic who really wasted a lot of
                    our time by launching off into long anecdotes in English. FSI let him get away
                    with that. He was a character and as a cultural study, it was extremely
                    interesting. You had to like him for his spontaneity, and sense of humor. But in
                    terms of language learning, it left a lot to be desired. I think 80% of what
                    Serbian we learned, we learned from Jankovic. But we did get a certain exposure
                    to Serbian mores and way of life.</p>
                <p>Since I was destined for Zagreb I had to fine-tune my language after I got to
                    Zagreb because I arrived at the point when the first stirrings of Croatian
                    nationalism were starting to manifest themselves and people became more
                    sensitive about the differences between the language variants. You wanted to be
                    sure you didn't use the Serbian variant if you could help it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came to Zagreb in '67 to '69. What was the situation
                        in Zagreb when you got there? I mean Croatia, well, Yugoslavia, how did you
                        see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We still supported the Tito half, as someone who helped keep the
                    Soviets at bay in that region, and could also serve as an alternative model for
                    the rest of Eastern Europe. So, we were inclined to be very sympathetic to the
                    Titoist structure, perhaps as events finally unfolded more sympathetic than we
                    should have been. However the real crackdown wasn't until 1971, two years after
                    I left, when Tito eliminated both in Zagreb and in Belgrade the group of the
                    more liberal politicians who were there. Basically a lot of the people who got
                    shunted aside, or even arrested, were people who might have, had they stayed in
                    power, moved Yugoslavia in a different direction than the violent disintegration
                    that finally occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Zagreb, it's a consulate general, and it
                        had Croatia and Slovenia, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were pretty well committed to a unified Yugoslavia. In
                        the first place, how did we view at that time, as you saw it, the Soviet
                        threat there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I don't think there was a feeling that the Soviets were inclined to
                    have a military confrontation with Yugoslavia. The concern was more at the risk
                    of a political accommodation where the Yugoslavs for economic or other reasons,
                    might move closer to the Soviets who could then exploit that over the longer
                    term to gradually undo the Yugoslav experiment, and move Yugoslavia gradually
                    back into their camp.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point. We'll pick it up again.
                        We've just started on the situation in Zagreb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 22nd of May 1995. What was the responsibility of the consulate
                    general in Zagreb when you were there? We're talking '67 to '69.</p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had the normal responsibilities of any constituent post including
                    protection and welfare of American citizens. Our consular district, which
                    consisted of the two republics of Croatia and Slovenia, and we provided the full
                    range of consular services including visas. We did political and economic
                    reporting. For a constituent post, we were pretty well staffed. We had a consul
                    general, we had two political-economic officers, we had two consular officers,
                    although only one was a real consul. We had an admin officer, and of course a
                    well staffed FSN group as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it's an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The basic staffing has stayed almost the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Bob Owen. My tour coincided entirely with his. He stayed four years
                    and I think I arrived in his second year and left at the end of his third
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular assignment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was chief of the consular section, so I oversaw all of the range of
                    consular responsibilities that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know one of the things that gave me great pleasure was
                        the fact that the autos trade, the so-called main highway between Croatia
                        and Serbia when I was consul general in essentially Serbia was that you had
                        two-thirds of the autos trade because a lot of accidents on the highways so
                        you got a disproportionate number of the accidents as your responsibility,
                        which did not give me any great heartache.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Actually, I have to say that tragically I lost a good friend who had
                    gone through language training, Hanna Woods.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I knew Hanna. That was a terrible automobile
                        accident, a very dangerous highway. What were the main consular things that
                        you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had very active visa issuance. There were a lot of Croatians who
                    traveled to the United States, and the immigrant visa operation was also fairly
                    busy because of the large number of Croatians who had immigrated after the war,
                    so there were a lot of family petitions. And then we had protection cases, a few
                    of them come to mind as having taken a lot of time and effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get a feel for what this meant.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I guess the most dramatic one was a man who was a writer, in fact had
                    won the National Book Award in the early '50s, but had suffered from paranoia,
                    and I believe some drug addiction as well. He was living in Rome, and was
                    involved with a “clinic” that was apparently being used as a drug center. The
                    granddaughter of the first post-war president of Italy, Luigi Einaudi, became
                    involved with this individual and in the drug scene. Partly because of her
                    involvement there was an Italian crackdown on this group. The writer got wind of
                    it, and hopped in his car and fled because he knew that if he were picked up in
                    Italy he would be put away for a long time. So he drove across the border into
                    Slovenia. This was at night and since his lights were defective he was picked up
                    by Slovenian police and had his passport taken. He started calling the embassy
                    for assistance, and started trying personally to reach the ambassador, and I
                    think the embassy very quickly recognized that this was not a normal individual
                    and it was going to be very complicated. He wanted to go down to Belgrade but,
                    of course, they said, “No, you're in the Zagreb consular district.” He got down
                    to Zagreb, and then we began a period—it seemed like months, perhaps just a
                    month for all of this to play out, but it seemed interminable. He did have
                    money, so he was staying at the Palace Hotel, coming into the consulate every
                    day and spinning fantasies about how the CIA and everybody else was out to get
                    him, and becoming increasingly agitated. I was trying to figure out how to
                    resolve this in a way that would protect his rights as an American citizen, but
                    at the same time get him out of our hair because he was starting to take up
                    two-three or more hours a day. At one point he called me at midnight, woke me up
                    saying, “There are some men here who claim to want to take me to a hospital, but
                    I don't know who they are or what's going on. Will you come down and check it
                    out?” I did, and he was right but shortly after I arrived they left. But There
                    was another man lurking in the background who came up to me as soon as they left
                    and introduced himself. He was an agent of the Einaudi family, and he said, “I'm
                    sorry that you interfered with this little action of ours because we really do
                    think he needs help.” As we talked I could also sense that his real concern was
                    protecting the Einaudi family. Checking with the embassy in Rome, I was told to
                    have nothing to do with the writer who was considered potentially dangerous. The
                    Italians had also put out through Interpol a look-out for him. What I finally
                    did was, and this was skirting a fine line, to share most of what I knew with
                    the Slovenia authorities. They had a foreign ministry because the republics had
                    some nominal foreign policy responsibilities. I gave some of the background on
                    the writer to the head of the office, Dr. Murko, and I said, “This person's
                    passport is being held by your magistrate, and I'm going to accompany him up
                    there and hope you will do the proper thing.” I guess my assumption was that
                    with the Interpol watch, and the other indications that the writer could be a
                    risk, they might decide to contact the Italians, or take him into some sort of
                    custody. In fact, when I went up there we went to the magistrate, he said, “Oh,
                    yes, Mr. Rackmales, I've heard from a subordinate.” He sat down, asked a few
                    brief questions and then said, “Okay, here's your passport.” The writer was
                    quite pleased, and as we walked out we looked at each other, and said, “Okay,
                    now what?” I excused myself because I wanted to try to find out more, if I
                    could, from Dr. Murko, who had clearly decided to decline the hot potato. He
                    said, “We gave him his passport back, aren't you happy?” I replied, “If that's
                    your decision, fine, we'll take it from there.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Shortly afterward the writer did decide voluntarily to go for treatment in a
                    clinic in Switzerland, much to my relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's no real answer because you couldn't use
                        restraints, and they could be dangerous. I mean both to themselves and to
                        others, and yet your tools were essentially persuasion either with the
                        person, which is not very good, or with the local authorities who also don't
                        want to be involved at all, as you know. Get them moving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, I suspect that was probably the basic motivation. They also
                    didn't want to have this guy hanging around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with, particularly with Croats who
                        had left before communist times, or fled during it, who became Americans,
                        who came back and tried to agitate, and overthrow Tito and that type of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think it was still considered too dangerous for them to do anything
                    that would make them conspicuous. Around that time we saw the first evident
                    signs of Croatian nationalism, and a slightly freer atmosphere. We did have a
                    few cases of people who had left for political reasons, and who would come back
                    and get picked up on the charge of having avoided the draft. One case in
                    Slovenia involved a young man who had made a couple of broadcasts in the
                    Cleveland area, and he came back and was charged, not with political activities,
                    but with having evaded the draft. Eventually he was able to get out. I do not
                    recall any cases of individuals actually coming back and trying to organize
                    political activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, on the record. How did you find dealing
                        with the Croatian and Slovenia authorities? Not necessarily just on the
                        consular side, but anything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: In general, in my first year until the summer of '68, the Slovene
                    authorities were warmer and friendlier. The Croats that I dealt with correct,
                    but a bit standoffish. That changed in August of '68 dramatically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what August of '68 meant, and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia shocked the Yugoslavs and had an
                    especially strong effect in Croatia partly because a large number of
                    Czechoslovaks were vacationing in Croatia at the time of the invasion. It was a
                    popular vacation spot since the Czechs could not travel to the west, but were
                    allowed to visit Yugoslavia. So there were something like 50,000 Czechs in
                    Croatia when the invasion took place.A few days after the invasion we were
                    trying to cope with the long lines of Czechs and Slovaks who were trying to get
                    to the United States because they didn't want to go back to their own country.
                    We had planned a dinner party at which the head of the consular section of the
                    Croatian Foreign Ministry was one of the guests. She had always been polite, but
                    cool in her dealings with me but as soon as she arrived she rushed up and she
                    hugged me warmly. I was a little startled for a second and then I realized there
                    had been really a change of attitude, and things were much warmer after
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We always had a problem because Yugoslavia was open to the
                        Eastern European countries, but the Eastern European countries weren't open
                        to the west. So people would come from Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany
                        to vacation and try to get the hell out to the west and claim asylum, and we
                        were kind of in between. Let's say before and then after the Czech thing,
                        what were your instructions, how did you deal with people who came in and
                        requested asylum, or help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: For those who were not of intelligence interest our basic message was,
                    you're on your own hook, we cannot help you in any way to leave. Obviously, if
                    the person appeared to have information that might be of intelligence value,
                    then we'd arrange for them to meet with one of the agency types. Otherwise, we
                    said, good luck fellows, you're on your own hook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to sort of say, well, if I were trying to get out,
                        I certainly wouldn't try to go this way, but I might go that way, or
                        something like that. We tried to do our best but it was a very difficult
                        position for all of us. What was the view of you all in the consulate
                        general, the officers sitting there looking at whither Croatia and its
                        relations within the greater Yugoslavia. We're talking about '67 to
                        '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: It's a tough question because I have to guard against reading back
                    into my views, at that time everything that has transpired since then. I don't
                    think that we were seriously concerned at that point of a breakup of the
                    country, or anything like what in fact happened in the '90s. In Zagreb we were
                    encouraged by the openness, and flexibility with which the Croatian leadership
                    was handling the use of nationalism. We recognized the risk of violence,
                    inter-ethnic violence in that period of the late '60s. Many soccer games between
                    Serbian and Croatian teams would end in some sort of bloody riot. But I think we
                    felt that the answer was in a more liberal leadership that would channel these
                    emotions into politically acceptable forms. Of course, this was several years
                    before Tito cracked down on nationalism and liberalism in '71. He purged the
                    leaderships of both the Croatian and the Serbian party of those who had shown
                    any tolerance for manifestations of nationalism, a misguided decision that
                    helped bring on some of the later tragedies.</p>
                <p>Looking back in those years, '67 to '69, the consulate general was tracking the
                    impact of nationalism and on the whole felt that it was manageable in that time
                    and in that context, and with a leadership that was showing a certain openness
                    and flexibility in handling it, while staying within the broad parameters that
                    Tito had laid down to that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the chief of the consular section, you're probably
                        seeing more Croats and Slovenes than anybody else in the consulate. Did you
                        get any impression from all the interviews you were having about how
                        deep-seated the feelings were towards the communist system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think people were still nervous in those years of engaging in
                    outspoken anti-communism. People I was interviewing in my office would assume
                    they were being recorded. I don't recall people sitting down and spilling their
                    guts about how terrible things were. Also, the fact of an acceptance by the
                    Croatian communist party of a certain amount of overt expression of a Croatian
                    nationalism acted as a safety valve. So that it took the form of people
                    expressing strong support for the then nationalist leaders of Croatia. In those
                    years it was hard to dig underneath and find out just how strong anti-communism
                    as opposed to anti-Serb as opposed to anti-Serb sentiment was. The latter was
                    often expressed in ethnic jokes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having been in Serbia, the Serbs took great delight in
                        telling me how awful the Nazi-supported Croatian regime was. How did the
                        Croats that you would talk to treat what happened during World War II from
                        that respective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: In most cases diffidence. Some would speak about how their families
                    were persecuted and that sort of thing. There was a certain amount of joking
                    over some of the language, the extremes. This was again a safety valve. You were
                    not supposed to use any non-Croatian expression during the Pavelic period. So
                    you couldn't say “telephone”. You had to use a made-up Croatian term.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like the Germans with their Fairenspectre.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's it. So there was a certain amount of joking and laughing, maybe
                    to cover up embarrassment. But it was not a subject that people readily talked
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you traveled around? Did you find that you
                        were followed, or was it a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was never aware of being followed. Usually when I would travel, it
                    would be on pretty well defined consular business. We did a lot of social
                    security investigations involving funeral expenses. We got to go to interesting
                    places, some pretty remote. The most memorable of those trips was to a tiny
                    little island off of Zadar. I had to go in a rowboat because there was no
                    regular boat service to this place. I think there may have been 100 or 150
                    people on the island. The family of the deceased had submitted receipts showing
                    that so-and-so had been buried with a headstone. So I arrived in this tiny place
                    and asked to see the priest who signed the receipt. I finally found him. He was
                    obviously totally nonplused, and after opening pleasantries, I said, “Do you
                    remember so-and-so?” “Oh, yes.” “The Social Security Administration has asked me
                    to check, so could I please see the grave?” And he looked totally abashed, and
                    said, “Well, in fact there is no grave.” Then he admitted openly that it was a
                    fictitious receipt. I said, “Well, I'm terribly sorry, but of course this cannot
                    be reimbursed.” He said, “I understand. I'm terribly sorry, I understand.” We
                    spent thousands and thousands of dollars trekking all over Croatia-Slovenia, and
                    that was the one time that in fact there was clearly fraud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of my favorite expressions I learned was, take me to
                        your marble monument, because everyone claimed they had a marble monument
                        and we'd find usually a cement something with a name scrawled with
                        somebody's finger in the wet cement. Interestingly, when I did this I saw a
                        chart that we did and the real fraud was grouped on the Greek border. Greece
                        had a lot of problems, and it spilled over into Macedonia for the most part.
                        For the rest of it, they're pretty honest, non-conniving people. This is one
                        of their problems, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: To an extent there probably was fraud which we couldn't detect. The
                    headstone is pretty tangible, but the traditional wake with sucking pig,
                    slivovitz, and wine was harder to pin down. Sometimes the quantity seemed high
                    but they would say, “It's the custom, you have to invite the whole village,
                    otherwise...”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to supply gloves and handkerchiefs too. Did you
                        get any feel for Croatian and Slovene immigration to the United States, how
                        successful it was, where the people were going to? Were there any patterns
                        that you noticed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Slovenes in the Cleveland area were numerous, and in Chicago also,
                    and the Croats on the Pacific coast. There were a lot of Dalmatians because of
                    the fishing industry. A lot of our tuna industry is in the hands of Croatians.
                    They also have vineyards in the Napa Valley, the Grgick family, and others. So
                    there are concentrations in some of the large mid-west cities and the Pacific
                    coast. There was a big Croatian community from one of the islands who all went
                    to Hoboken. In fact there were more people from that island living in Hoboken
                    than there were living on the island. I was struck with the success, with the
                    frugality, and the ability of these immigrants in a very short period of time to
                    accumulate savings which far exceeded what most of us are able to save and you
                    wonder how did they do it. But they were obviously very hard working, energetic
                    people, who lived modestly and saved so they could then afford to bring in other
                    members of the family. So I never worried too much about these people becoming a
                    public charge.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: To a year of university area studies at Indiana University. I spent
                    the academic year '69-'70 at Bloomington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Indiana? Did it have...often a university

                        find any of that when you went to Indiana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Let me preface it by saying that '69-'70 of course was the height of
                    protests on campuses across the country, the year of Kent State...</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, that's right. Indiana was less affected than some campuses. It
                    was one of the more conservative campuses. Obviously there were student groups
                    who were opposed to the war, but there was not the degree of disruption that was
                    experienced in some other places. But Vietnam was definitely the issue that
                    overshadowed everything else. Eastern Europe was not an area where at that point
                    there was a tremendous debate over what we should or shouldn't be doing. The
                    Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia may have temporarily reduced U.S. interest, or
                    the interest of the public at least on Eastern Europe, because it didn't look as
                    if there was much in the short term that we could do about it. As luck, and poor
                    planning by the State Department would have it, the people who were the core of
                    the faculty in Balkan studies, Charles and Barbara Jelavich, were both on
                    sabbatical during the year that I was there. I had planned to do a fair amount
                    on Yugoslavia but ended up with a more scattered approach simply because the key
                    people on Yugoslavia weren't around.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the demonstrations against
                        Vietnam? Were you supposed to stand up for the government view? Or could you
                        kind of keep your head down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I pretty much kept my head down. I didn't feel that the State
                    Department had sent me there to defend U.S. policy. I certainly never got any
                    signal to that effect. A couple of my professors in a friendly way said that
                    emotions were so high on the subject that it was best to avoid it. That wasn't
                    hard since I had my own questions and reservations about our policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Back to the Department as the desk officer for Albania and
                    Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about...this would be '70 to '72, because
                        Albania and Bulgaria hardly ever raised a blip on our radar which in a way
                        was kind of fun because they were yours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. I was the government expert on those two places, and
                    none of my superiors had direct experience on either one. So on the few
                    occasions when something came up that got the Secretary's or Under Secretary's
                    attention, you were drawn on more than if you were the German desk officer,
                    because then you've got all kinds of expertise in between. But with those two
                    countries I would get calls from the White House. I remember Senator Weicker had
                    a very strong interest in Albania for reasons that escape me for the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weicker from Connecticut?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Connecticut, yes. He was trying to get into Albania, he wanted to go
                    there. So I would go over and brief him on the situation there and suggest ways
                    that he could try to get in. Of course I warned him that we had no relations, in
                    fact there is no protecting power so if you run into a problem there's nothing
                    we can do. But that didn't deter him from trying. During the two years that I
                    was on the desk there was a shift in the mindset about Albania where it went
                    from, hell no, we have no interest in relations, to the Deputy Secretary Rusk
                    saying, we are prepared if the Albanians are interested to look towards the
                    resumption of relations, which I don't think anyone expected because the
                    Albanians in that period were in their most isolationist phase and would have
                    seen it as a real threat to themselves to make any gesture to the United States.
                    But I was in favor of that kind of shift in policy because I thought it was a
                    more realistic approach than the one that simply ignored the existence of this
                    little country.</p>

                        Just personalities within the State Department, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I perhaps played some small role in that. Dick Davies who was the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary at that point for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
                    was supportive. A part of the attention in those years to Albania was prompted
                    by a request that the Italian government made to us to trade property. We owned
                    the building [in Tirana, the Albanian capital] which the Italians were using as
                    their chancery and residence. They paid us rent, so they were our tenants. I
                    think it was in 1971 they said, “We have some property in Bucharest which we
                    don't need, or we're giving up, and we would be happy to swap that with you.”
                    Our embassy in Bucharest was very strongly in favor of it, and were lobbying
                    very hard for us to accept the Italian offer. I was making the case that at some
                    point we would want to go back in, that there are damn few suitable
                    properties—in fact, no suitable property in Tirana, and that we don't want to
                    give this up because at some point we'll need it. In fact, it is still the
                    property, it is now the residence and the chancery, and I'm told the best
                    property in Tirana. Anyway, my arguments carried the day, and it could be that
                    there was a spillover effect because again it was one of the few times when you
                    got some attention from the Seventh Floor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with the Albanian government? Can you
                        describe how we saw it, and any interest the Americans might have in the
                        problems of the Albania situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was at a time when Stalinism had virtually disappeared from the
                    rest of Eastern Europe. Albania was the last refuge of Stalinism. The human
                    rights situation in Albania was far worse than anywhere else. The only
                    comparison today would be North Korea. There was a feeling that ultimately the
                    Albanians would have to reenter Europe, that their strategy of becoming an
                    entirely isolated outpost supported by China could not last. So it was a
                    question of time. I don't think any of us expected any immediate change there
                    because the control was so tight. The Chinese in those years hadn't yet gotten
                    tired of supporting this tiny little country. So it seemed like a fairly stable
                    situation. We were positioning ourselves for a future role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Bulgaria? There we had relations. What was the
                        situation '70-'72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Relations were very limited. There were some commercial relations. I
                    remember General Motors imported a lot of wine and this was the result of a deal
                    whereby General Motors had shipped some either auto parts or factory components
                    and took its payment in Bulgarian wine which I was told that they used as a
                    component in making anti-freeze. Now it's marketed in supermarkets, but in those
                    days it was pretty unusual. Political relations were obviously very, very cool.
                    I guess the main thing that happened in the two years that I was on the desk was
                    the beginning of a more active customs cooperation designed to impede the flow
                    of drugs through Bulgaria. There was a visit to Bulgaria by the head of U.S.
                    customs, who was very well received by his Bulgarian counterpart, and at least
                    the customs officials were quite happy with the beginning of a more active
                    Bulgarian participation in the anti-drug efforts. Beyond that I think we sent
                    the astronauts to Bulgaria on a goodwill visit. Around that time the Bulgarian
                    embassy was shaken when their third ranking person got picked up for shop
                    lifting in Woodies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The ambassador was an old party hack who invited my wife and me
                    regularly for dinner with some of our State Department colleagues. The yogurt
                    was great. I don't believe they had a very active embassy because of the
                    ambassador's age, and lack of fluency in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our representation in Bulgaria? What was your

                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: We obviously had little leverage with the Bulgarians, trade wasn't
                    significant, there was no political leverage because they took their orders from
                    Moscow. We had a small embassy given the level of work, but I think they did a
                    competent job. We had a series of professional ambassadors. John McSweeney was
                    there when I started on the desk, and then Tully Torbert was the ambassador for
                    the second half of my tour. I helped him go through the confirmation process,
                    and visited him the second year I was on the desk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Not in those years. Not too many years after that you began to get the
                    crack-down on the Bulgarian Turks, the banning of Turkish names, etc., but that
                    happened in the '80s. There probably were tensions even then in the Turkish
                    areas but we had very restricted access, and I don't recall if we had any
                    Turkish language officers in the embassy in the early '70s as we did in the
                    '80s. In the '80s we had some very fluent Turkish speakers who facilitated our
                    access there. I went back to Sofia in '86 at the height of the pressures and the
                    concern about the Bulgarian Turks. In fact, when they were fleeing by hundreds
                    of thousands from Bulgaria. But in the early '70s I just don't recall our having
                    focused on that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Macedonia as a Bulgarian issue? Did you find
                        yourself clashing with either the Yugoslav or Greek desks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: In the early '70s one of the ways the Soviets, when they were annoyed
                    at the Yugoslavs, would show their annoyance would be to let the Bulgarians
                    publish something about Macedonia. I think there were one or two episodes of
                    that in that period. The Bulgarians would piously say, this doesn't represent
                    any political move, these are just historians writing and it has nothing to do
                    with claims on another country. But the Yugoslav Macedonians would be furious,
                    and say that's nonsense, these are all state employees and they couldn't do this
                    without permission, that sort of thing. I don't think we got overly excited
                    about that particular thing because it was viewed more as a way the Soviets had
                    of conducting a little war of nerves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling at that time that the Soviets
                        were pretty much calling Bulgaria's foreign relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, I think that was pretty much a given. There might have been
                    regional issues where the Bulgarians would be given some leeway, but on all of
                    the major issues they stuck to the Soviet line.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: No, I don't think so. Because I don't think anyone ever foresaw that
                    operating independently so that if it came to any military conflict which would
                    have involved Bulgaria there was a much stronger force there. The attach�s, I'm
                    sure, followed the question of the size, capabilities, because that's their job.
                    I don't think it was ever viewed as a kind of separate, independent variable as
                    opposed to the capabilities of the Soviet Union militarily.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Somalia Republic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. Actually one of the reasons they asked me to go to
                    Somalia was that General Siad, the Somali leader, was becoming closer and closer
                    to the Soviets. The Soviets had stepped in after the army coup in 1969. Somalia
                    had tried to maintain a balance and to remain neutral, so they asked western
                    countries to train its police force, and the Soviets to train the military.
                    Well, that turned to be a rather fateful choice because it gave the Soviets
                    great entre when the military took over in a coup. In '72 - '73 when I was
                    there, they were the dominant foreign power. I would qualify that by saying that
                    the Somalis remained extremely xenophobic, they mistrusted the Soviets as well
                    as the West. This was not a loving relationship. We got to know some of the
                    Soviet embassy people reasonably well and they would speak frankly about certain
                    issues, and one certainly was that they all felt very uncomfortable there. They
                    were treated with the same suspicion as diplomats, as we were. But they were
                    providing the Somali military with the wherewithal to try to recover eventually
                    what they viewed as lost territories in the Ogaden.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me backtrack just a bit on this. Can we talk once
                        again about the contacts...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Very limited contacts. Any ordinary Somali who would be seen talking
                    to Americans would be at the very least questioned very harshly, and possibly
                    imprisoned just for having talked to us. Our cook, for example, got thrown into
                    jail for three days for defending United States in a bar. Generally speaking we
                    could not meet with ordinary Somalis. We had very limited official contacts, but
                    had to rely primarily on official statements for day to day information. There
                    was an official news service. With other diplomats we would share at cocktail
                    parties the limited amount of information that we had. The Italians had the best
                    contacts, in fact better than the Russians because Mogadishu had been an Italian
                    colony and a lot of people still spoke Italian. They had a slightly larger
                    embassy than we did and had known a number of key Somalis for many years. So
                    they had the kind of depth that was very helpful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had a consular problem in Hargeysa and I tried to use it to get up
                    there myself, and also make a side visit to Berbera which was the big Soviet
                    base. Berbera is a city on the Red Sea. The Somalis turned that down, so I sent
                    the consular officer just to Hargeysa and they did allow him to go up, but he
                    reported back that everyone he talked to had been called in immediately, and
                    some of them arrested. Hargeysa was a particularly delicate area for them, the
                    whole north was, but there was also a general policy that they didn't want
                    people talking to foreign diplomats.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We, in fact, had to rely on that sophisticated police organization in
                    the aftermath of the assassinations in Khartoum of Ambassador Noel and his
                    deputy. There were several countries in Africa where PLO-connected terrorists
                    suddenly appeared and started casing American missions. That happened in Kampala
                    and Mogadishu. The group that was casing us moved in directly across the street
                    and made no particular attempt to disguise their activities. So we went to the
                    Somali government which was fully supportive, and greatly stepped up the
                    protection afforded the embassy. We were driving around with Somali escorts. And
                    one of the things that struck us was that, although there had always been
                    beggars in the general area, a new “blind” beggar suddenly appeared in front of
                    the Embassy. We were told quietly that he wasn't really blind or a beggar. So
                    they were using a lot of different techniques. They called the Palestinians in
                    and questioned them very closely. Eventually they expelled that group. But that
                    activity did result in shortening both my own and Ambassador Looram's tour
                    because his wife was a Rothschild, and I am also Jewish, and the security people
                    came out in that context and recommended that the threat was too high to
                    continue the normal tour of duty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave this would you talk again about your one
                        contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I noticed in the news bulletin there was a new official who apparently
                    had the United States as part of his responsibilities. So I called and somewhat
                    to my surprise I was able to get an appointment, because usually requests for
                    official meetings required an extremely clear reason, no courtesy calls or
                    anything like that. But in this case he did agree to meet with me, and we had
                    actually a pleasant conversation. He was a bit guarded, but otherwise friendly.
                    So we did end up, myself, the ambassador and the DCM, the three of us were
                    sharing this one useful contact.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This shows how hungry reporting officers can be, because
                        you have to have somebody. When you left Somalia how did you see it? In '73
                        where did you see American interests at the time, and how did you see things
                        developing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There were colleagues in the embassy who said, “Why are we here? It's
                    pointless, there's almost no real business, why don't we just close up the
                    place?” My reply was, “This current arrangement is not eternal, the country is
                    going to change in ways that we can't foresee, and we have to be positioned so
                    that when things do change we can react appropriately.” And in fact only a few
                    years later there was another military coup, this time in Ethiopia. The Soviets
                    said, “Ha, we have a juicier prize here.” They were realistic enough to know
                    that you can't have both Somalia and Ethiopia as clients. So they dropped
                    Somalia unceremoniously. We picked up Somalia, maybe a little too eagerly in my
                    view, but anyway we did. So there was long term benefit in having it even under
                    conditions when there was not a lot of work...I remember that our office hours
                    were 7:00 to 2:00 five days a week and 7:00 to noon on Saturday. And at 2:00
                    Ambassador Looram would come around and direct you to stop whatever you were
                    doing, saying, “How can you possibly be so inefficient.” This was a credit to
                    him and extremely important given the isolation, and the fact that the medical
                    facilities were terrible. So at 2:00 we shut down, we went to the beach houses,
                    we swam, played bridge, etc. Despite the stress from social isolation, and poor
                    medical facilities, Mogadishu was actually quite a pleasant place.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: The spouse of one officer had a serious drinking problem. I don't
                    recall that most people had severe problems with alcohol. There was one problem
                    where there was a severe marital problem of someone whose spouse had gotten
                    involved during a trip to Asmara, and this person had a friend in Asmara who
                    sent him a message back. And I remember that turned into a crisis where I had to
                    go with the nurse because the spouse, when confronted with this, had taken an
                    apparent overdose of something. It turned out, fortunately, that it was not a
                    serious enough overdose to threaten her life. But she was distraught, and needed
                    support. It was not always an easy post for families.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: Right, talk about a change.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, from '73 to '76. Well, it's on the water. What were

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was the principal officer. Trieste, right after the war was quite an
                    important post because in the uncertainty about the long term status, it was a
                    free city for a while, and then there were negotiations which were concluded in
                    1954 and set what eventually turned out to be the final boundary between
                    Yugoslavia and Italy. But that was not formalized until 1975. In 1968, as part
                    of one of the wave of reductions in posts for budgetary reasons the State
                    Department announced, that Trieste would be closed and its functions transferred
                    to Milan. The Italian government reacted so strongly to that that their
                    president personally intervened with President Johnson. So we canceled the plans
                    to close the post, but it was reduced in size, At the time I arrived, there was
                    only one American employee, the principal officer, and six Italian employees. I
                    was able to get a second officer assigned in my second year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the reason for saving it...I've always thought it was
                        it sort of a political one because if we closed the post it would show we
                        were no longer interested in Trieste, and the Italians wanted to keep this
                        as a territory and we were instrumental in their getting it. So it was
                        almost internally political, rather than just the convenience of doing
                        consular work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Keeping it open was primarily a gesture to the Italians. But in early
                    1974 the Yugoslavs decided that they were not content with the provisional
                    status of the borders, so they put up signs that said you are now entering
                    Yugoslavia. This was a technical violation of the London agreement of 1954
                    because under those agreements you were not entering Yugoslavia, you were
                    entering Zone B. The Italians naturally strongly objected and you had right wing
                    groups in Italy holding rallies, in Trieste and elsewhere. It looked for a time
                    as if it was not out of the question that there would be a military clash. The
                    Yugoslavs started moving tanks up near the border, and took other steps that was
                    probably part of a war of nerves to convince the Italians that they were
                    serious. So they were putting in bunkers and things like that. And we were able
                    to do some good reporting despite the fact that we didn't have any classified
                    reporting capability. The Navy sent a destroyer at that time up which docked in
                    Trieste just to reassure the Italians and remind the Yugoslavs that Italy is
                    part of NATO. With that ship in port we were able to step up our reporting which
                    I think was very useful to the Department at the time. The dispute was finally
                    settled in 1975 with the Treaty of Osimo, that confirmed what was obvious to
                    most people, that the borders weren't going to be changed, and that they are the
                    official state borders. So the sign at that point became legitimate. Even the
                    disintegration of Yugoslavia didn't change that although it changed the wording
                    of the sign. After Osimo it probably was just a question of time before Trieste
                    closed. I think it was finally closed around 1985, about ten years later. By
                    that point there was not a lot of either commercial or other activity. Trieste
                    isn't a major tourist center, American businesses don't have much of a presence
                    there. So in an era where there are continuing rounds of closing of posts, it
                    would be hard to justify keeping Trieste open.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the Italians were quite open, I mean, you could

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oh, absolutely. As I said it was a total and dramatic contrast from
                    Somalia. The issues that I started out concentrating on were not so much the
                    Yugoslav issues because domestically Italy was going through a period of great
                    ferment. The divorce referendum was the first sign of a big secular change in
                    Italy. Trieste was among the areas that kind of led the trend towards moving
                    Italy into the mainstream European moderate secular consensus. It was a shock to
                    some when Italy voted to abandon its previous divorce laws, and then abortion
                    followed.</p>

                        the people of Trieste were a breed apart, or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oh, yes, very much so. Many of them longed for the Austro-Hungarian
                    empire. Of course Trieste's glory days were when it was the principal port for
                    the Austro-Hungarian empire, and when it lost its Slovak hinterland a lot of its
                    economic rationale disappeared, because it's way off in a little corner of Italy
                    next to Yugoslavia. It continued to be an important retail center for Yugoslavs.
                    You remember I'm sure, the busloads of people from Belgrade, Zagreb and
                    Ljubljana. On weekends you couldn't move in downtown Trieste because the
                    Yugoslavs were everywhere buying jeans and other western goods. But it was not a
                    very balanced or healthy economy. The city was the oldest city in Italy because
                    a lot of the young people would leave for better employment opportunities in the
                    rest of Italy, particularly Lombardy. As the American consul, I was pressured to
                    join the Rotary Club which I did. It had maybe a hundred members. There were two
                    of us under forty, and there weren't more than half a dozen under sixty. And I
                    would say that fully half of the members were over eighty. So the meetings were
                    not especially lively, but it reflected an aging city. We were always treated
                    very graciously. We had complete access and entre to everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy use you much? Or did you exist on your
                        own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think at the beginning I was pretty much on my own, but there were
                    two times when I had very intensive and close coordination with the embassy.
                    First during the crisis, if that's the right word, with Yugoslavia which lasted
                    for a couple months in 1974. I was pleased that given the sensitivity of the
                    issues the embassy did not try to censor or tell me what to report and I think
                    they were fairly pleased on the reporting on that. And then later the earthquake
                    that hit the area in 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it in your area, in your district?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oh yes, very much. The epicenter was probably about a hundred miles
                    northwest in the part of the Friuli north of Udine. The earthquake was strong
                    enough that there was significant damage even in Trieste. We were in a
                    restaurant and we heard a sound that sounded like a train passing nearby, and
                    suddenly the chandeliers started to sway. I had never been through a real
                    earthquake before so it took me a few seconds longer than some to realize what
                    was going on. I had been scheduled to leave the following morning to give a talk
                    in Florence. I woke up early and I turned on the radio and it was very clear
                    from those early broadcasts that this had been a major earthquake, and it was in
                    my district so I called Bob Gordon, the principal officer in Florence, and I
                    said, “Bob, I can't come down today, we've had a major earthquake and I have to
                    stay up here.” So we started immediately checking our registration files to see
                    what American citizens were in that area, and trying to reach them. The vice
                    consul focused on that, and I was able to arrange with an American who worked
                    for Bell Helicopter and had a helicopter in Trieste, and I got the embassy's
                    concurrence to rent the helicopter. We flew over the damaged area for several
                    hours, landing in some of the worst-affected zones. I think we gave probably one
                    of the best early reports on the earthquake. When I realized the scope of the
                    tragedy I moved from Trieste to the Aviano Air Force Base because it was right
                    in that area and had excellent communications and spent the next three weeks
                    doing nothing but earthquake related activities. We had a visit by the vice
                    president several days after the quake and the U.S. Congress provided $25
                    million in earthquake assistance.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the population respond to the earthquake?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Friulani are sober, hard working people who tend to be stoical.
                    The first thing that strikes you when you land in an area that's just been hit
                    by a catastrophe, is that people are still numb and in a state of shock. I was
                    tremendously impressed though by the resilience of people, by their
                    determination that “we'll ride this out, and rebuild, and we'll start again.” I
                    worked very closely with the Italian government's earthquake commissioner. He
                    established his base in Udine, and I spent a lot of time with him. He was good
                    enough afterwards to get me the decoration of Commendatore, the equivalent of an
                    OBE from the Italian government. And then just to finish off that little
                    sub-segment, when there was an earthquake south of Naples in 1980, a few months
                    after I had arrived in Rome, the DCM remembered that I had been involved in '76
                    and said, “Go down and see if the consul general needs help.”</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: I was in the Office of East European Research and Analysis, and my
                    primary responsibility was for Romania and the GDR, German Democratic
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, how did we look upon the GDR in this particular
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, as a close and integral part of the Warsaw Pact it was a country
                    that was totally aligned with the Soviet Union that contributed a lot of
                    technological skills and a high level of industrialization to the Warsaw Pact as
                    economically one of the stronger members of that alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see it as a threat that could blow up, and this
                        would be the place that would drag us into World War III?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Not very much during the period that I was there. I think we tended to
                    defer a lot to West German perceptions and their sensitivities over the issue.
                    It was not, as I recall, one of the more eventful periods. There was a limited
                    amount of domestic unrest, mainly involving intellectuals, but they would
                    usually end up in the West. So it was more or less business as usual, meaning
                    our own limited bilateral contacts. One of the few surprises that I encountered
                    as an analyst was that there was actually more leeway for American diplomats to
                    have contacts and do reporting on the GDR than there was in most of the other
                    Warsaw Pact countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your best information coming from, CIA, State,
                        otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The embassy was by far the best source of information. I was struck by
                    how much people were able to get around. Having Romania as my other country, we
                    were much more constrained, despite the fact that our bilateral relationship
                    with Ceausescu, on the surface at least, was much stronger. Given the kind of
                    regime that Ceausescu ran, that didn't translate into our embassy having good
                    access to a wide range of Romanians. Whereas in the GDR there was actually quite
                    a bit of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When had we established relations with the GDR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: You mean opened our embassy? It was not a brand new mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel that the Soviets were pretty well calling the
                        shots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: On specifically German issues, the Soviets would sometimes defer to
                    the sensitivities of their client, probably on the theory that they were closer
                    to the issues so they didn't always insist except on obviously matters that were
                    of fundamental importance. So there was a certain maneuvering room. They never
                    tried to call 100% of all the decisions up and down the line. So the East
                    Germans had a certain limited countervailing influence on the Soviets, but on
                    all major issues it was strictly Soviet interest that dominated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel that the East Germans were in many ways the
                        most effective tool of the Soviet Union overseas. I always think of the East
                        Germans having, one, one of the best intelligence services; and two, being
                        able to establish very good counterintelligence services, or anti-spy
                        services in countries such as Libya, Syria, they were sort of good advisers
                        for those repressive regimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. There was a kind of division of responsibility among the
                    satellites of the Soviet Union and one of the roles that they asked the GDR to
                    undertake was intelligence, and often police training in third world countries.
                    So they were active in a number of places. If I remember correctly they had a
                    program going in Somalia as well when we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to Romania. The period you were there, Nixon was
                        out by this time wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. When I started Jerry Ford was still president, and then
                    Carter came in in the beginning of '77. It was perhaps slightly more eventful
                    following Romania in that period than it was following the GDR in the sense that
                    we were starting to see some of the first significant signs of opposition to
                    Ceausescu, and some of the results of the very repressive kind of regime that he
                    ran. I recall that there was a miners' strike that started in '77 that surprised
                    a number of people. It started some questioning as to whether our warm embrace
                    of Ceausescu needed to be modified in light of the dismal human rights record of
                    the Romanians. You remember that when the Carter administration came in, human
                    rights were going to be a major priority of the administration. Romania
                    presented them with a hard case because they were inclined to agree with the
                    previous Nixon and Ford's administrations approach to Romania which because of
                    its willingness to stand up to the Soviets that it was important to give them as
                    much support, give Ceausescu support, give him payoffs and rewards for his
                    independent policies. But starting in 1977, because of signs of human rights
                    based opposition in Romania were the first timid rethinking of priorities, and a
                    slightly more critical stance towards Ceausescu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in INR called upon to produce think pieces about
                        both whither Romania, and Romanian human rights and this type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, that was our essential job to write analyses of significant
                    events. I recall doing several on the miners' strike. I don't think we were at
                    that point foreseeing, and this turned out to be correct, in the short term a
                    threat to Ceausescu's control. His control was absolute and the miners' strike
                    was simply an embarrassment for him, and not a threat to him. But it was a kind
                    of turning point, I think. And then as the years went on, and as his political
                    and economic policies showed up more and more bankrupt internally, then of
                    course...and I'm leaping ahead now with a number of years when the Soviet grip
                    over the rest of Eastern Europe slipped badly. Then of course it became obvious
                    that there was no reason for us to continue a positive support. And we began
                    withholding most favored nation, and taking other punitive steps towards
                    Romania. That in 1977, I think, would have seemed probably premature to just
                    about everybody following the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of the feeling that the Soviets might try to
                        move back into Romania by force?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That question was raised, but I know that I and my colleagues in INR,
                    and I think the intelligence community, felt that there was little likelihood of
                    that as long as Ceausescu maintained control. The more likely approach for the
                    Soviets would be to try to identify some sort of alternative leadership to
                    replace Ceausescu with, rather than trying to move troops in. But, given the
                    very, very tight internal security, any Soviet moves to promote an alternative
                    leader were doomed to failure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left there in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: '78.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I joined OES, a relatively new bureau. It had only been established as
                    a bureau for a short time. It had been previously the Office of the Coordinator
                    for Science and Technology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OES stands for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Initially I would say I had a somewhat vague mandate, but fortunately
                    I joined just at the time that Congress was passing, in the State Department
                    authorization bill, significant legislation relating to science and technology
                    in foreign policy. It mandated that the State Department play a leading role in
                    ensuring that science and technology was given due attention, and would
                    coordinate the activities of other agencies. The new Assistant Secretary, who
                    just came in shortly after I joined OES, Tom Pickering, asked me to coordinate
                    the Department's response to Title V, which had two main dimensions to it. One
                    was that I served as the executive secretary of a task force that otherwise
                    consisted of three senior Foreign Service officers, Dirk Gleysteen, Frank Perez
                    and Richard Johnson. The task force was charged with preparing the report to
                    Congress that was called for in the legislation. It was due within six months of
                    the passage of the bill. The bill was passed in June, if I remember correctly,
                    which meant by January we had to have the report in. And it had to spell out
                    what the State Department was going to do in the fields of training, personnel
                    assignments, planning, etc. Each of the three gentlemen I referred to had one
                    major segment of it and I was supposed to pull their contributions together in a
                    unified document, and deal with OMB which had a very strong interest in this
                    because of funding implications and because the other agencies involved were
                    looking suspiciously at the risk of the State Department trying to oversee their
                    activities. Organizations like the National Science Foundation, and some of the
                    cabinet departments had a long tradition of running their own international
                    programs without a lot of interference from the State Department. That was one
                    dimension.</p>
                <p>The other was to serve as executive secretary in an inter-agency committee called
                    the CISET, Committee on International Science, Engineering and Technology. I
                    think there were 23 agencies represented. Tom Pickering was the chair and I was
                    the executive secretary. We tried to get the other agencies to assist us in
                    improving communication among the agencies so that everybody knew what everybody
                    else was doing in the international arena. So from my personal standpoint it was
                    interesting and rewarding than just doing analysis on fairly stable foreign
                    policy issues. And I got a much better sense of how things worked in Washington,
                    working with OMB, working with other departments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going to this period, in the first place where was the
                        impetus for getting this coordinating role—was it Congress, was the State
                        Department after it? Do you know where that was coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Franklin Huddle, if you had to mention a single name. He was a senior
                    staffer at the Congressional Research Service in charge of their science and
                    technology, and he had a very strong belief that science and technology needed
                    to be more important in foreign policy. It was an approach made to order for an
                    activist Assistant Secretary like Tom Pickering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Tom Pickering was a particular type
                        of person who could take this job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: He had a lot of credibility with the Department leadership, and I
                    think a less dynamic Assistant Secretary would have let an opportunity slip. I
                    think the State Department, in the wake of Title V, was able at least
                    temporarily to carve out a larger role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem as it was seen at that time? That all
                        these various agencies had international exchange programs, and assistance
                        programs, and nobody knew what the others were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. That was part of it was that the agencies didn't seem to
                    be under any kind of control at all. In Frank Huddle's view a part of the
                    problem was that the State Department had no significant in-house science and
                    technology capabilities. He put great emphasis on creating a cadre of career
                    Foreign Service officers who knew something about science and technology,
                    preferably who would have advanced degrees in scientific or engineering
                    disciplines. But that has not happened, I think, to the extent that Huddle or
                    others would have liked. Our personnel system doesn't easily adapt itself to
                    bringing in and keeping, or creating any sizable group of specialists. But we do
                    have more such people, there is a sub-cone of science and technology specialists
                    and they fill probably between a third and a half of science attach�, or science
                    counselor positions in embassies overseas, which is probably higher than it was
                    before. We now have a few more Foreign Service officers who know enough to be
                    science counselor in Bonn, or London, and places like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any of the various agencies you had to deal
                        with particularly forthcoming, or the reverse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think the biggest problem, and one that is inherent in our system,
                    is the budgetary process. Each agency prepares its budget with a view towards
                    its Congressional constituency, towards its own bureaucracy, and I think what
                    they resisted particularly was State interference in that process. We didn't
                    make a lot of headway during the time I was there, and I'd be surprised if very
                    much more has been made since then, in getting much of a say in budgetary
                    submissions. We tried to get agencies to include us in their actual budget
                    preparation and they said, “No way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to the Board of Examiners, for example, and try
                        to see if they could do a little more recruiting of science people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That was part of the series of steps that we put in our initial report
                    to Congress that we would do more recruiting specifically and I think some of
                    that was done. I can't give you any numbers. It's very difficult to tell a
                    highly capable physicist, for example, that he'll do better as a Foreign Service
                    officer. His concern would be that he would very quickly fall behind his
                    competitors in the field. And obviously we didn't want to recruit people who
                    were not very successful in their field. I think that's the reason why the size
                    of the cadre in the State Department of highly trained scientists remains
                    extremely small. The career path of the State Department would not be attractive
                    to a lot of people whose primary interest was in pursuing a career in
                    science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Pickering is a major figure. He's ambassador to Russia

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: He was the most dynamic manager that I've ever worked for. In fact, I
                    would say he was well ahead of anyone else I encountered. He had tremendous
                    energy. He also had excellent personal ties to people in the Department
                    leadership and great credibility with members of Congress. His taking over OES
                    was a tremendous plus for the bureau. You could see the difference in terms of
                    attention in the rest of the building paid to OES when he was there.</p>

                    Eastern Europe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: 1980 to 1983.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation would you say in Italy in
                        that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was the aftermath of the kidnapping and murder of the Prime
                    Minister which took place in 1978, and terrorism, the Red Brigades were still a
                    major problem. In fact, during the time we were there was a major episode of
                    terrorism directed at the United States when the Red Brigades kidnapped General
                    Dozier, and held him prisoner for several months. So terrorism was a major
                    concern. Also, whether the center-left coalition, which governed Italy, could
                    maintain its cohesiveness. There was still great concern in Washington that as
                    the result of differences among the coalition parties that the Italian
                    communists which at that point were the second largest party in Italy in terms
                    of popular support, and which had very strong and stable base in central Italy,
                    would enter the government. So our reporting on the Italian communist party got
                    a lot of attention in Washington, and there was continued concern over that.
                    Fortunately, we were in a period where we could exercise greater flexibility,
                    and have wider contacts. It had only been I think in the mid-'70s, that we began
                    low-level overt contacts with the PCI. We had always had some people in the
                    station who surreptitiously would meet with some members of the party. But it
                    was only in '75, as I recall, that there was an overt channel between one of my
                    predecessors, Marty Wenick and a member of the communist party. It started with
                    someone who had no official position, but was a journalist. It was considered
                    too sensitive to meet with someone who was in the formal structure of the party.
                    The ground rules eased by 1980 so that my predecessor had had called on some of
                    the lower level officials of the party. And then Dick Gardner, who was the
                    ambassador when I arrived involved himself in this, caused some people some
                    heartburn, but he would go to social events which were arranged so that he could
                    meet with Giorgio Nanolitano, who was one of the three or four most important
                    leaders in the communist party at that time. That was done quietly, and his
                    reporting on that was not shared with the embassy staff. But he was sympathetic
                    to broadening our contacts with the parties. So in my first few months I
                    established contact with many more of the officials of the party including
                    several members of their top executive body, the executive committee, it used to
                    be called the Politburo. Perhaps my best informed contact was Aytonio Tato, the
                    party's press secretary, who doubled as personal assistant to Enrico Berlinguer,
                    the top communist leader, Tato's office was just on the other side of
                    Berlinguer's.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, basically ten feet away, so you had to pass through his office to
                    get to Berlinguer's.</p>

                        that time, and Italy was supposed to be different. I'm talking about the
                        1980s when he came out there. How did we see the Italian communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We saw them in that period as threatening our strategic interests in
                    the area. In other words, even though we had a more sophisticated understanding
                    of the fact that these people were not simply tools of the Soviets we were
                    convinced that their values and priorities indicated that if they were given
                    power in Italy they would be extremely unlikely to support the kind of policies
                    in the Mediterranean that we were trying to implement in the wake of the Soviet
                    deployment of the SS-20s. If you remember, that was the period when the Reagan
                    administration...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Right, and Italy was really in the forefront of the countries that
                    accepted U.S. proposals to put countervailing forces in, cruise missiles. And
                    offered a base at Comiso in Sicily. And that was opposed by the Italian
                    communists, so here we were again, although we understood that the Italian
                    communists were not simply tools of the Soviet Union, and I think the assessment
                    was that objectively the policies they would have followed in power given their
                    opposition to confrontational policies in Europe; the fact that yes, we don't
                    approve what the Soviets did but let's handle this in a negotiated way, let's
                    not ratchet up tensions by putting more arms and weapons in. And that was taken
                    as threatening to our objectives, the idea of an Italian communist government,
                    or a government that had significant Italian communist influence would have
                    worried a lot of people in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the embassy assess Berlinguer and particularly
                        the...were they different or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, my own assessment of Berlinguer, which I guess was the embassy's
                    assessment because nobody quarreled with the stuff I was writing, is that in
                    some ways, if you have to have a very large communist party, potentially a lot
                    of electoral appeal, Berlinguer was probably the least bad kind of leader for
                    that party to have. He was essentially a status quo kind of politician, and he
                    did not like to rock boats. And what that meant was that he was depleting the
                    enthusiasm of the ideologically committed communists who viewed him as far too
                    cautious. He was a reassuring figure to the Italian population as a whole
                    because he wasn't threatening. He seemed, and probably was basically a fairly
                    honest, decent person. So what you got was a gradually declining Italian
                    communist party which I argued was in some ways in the Italian context a safer
                    situation than a dramatic split in the party, or something which would cause a
                    party which instead of having 30% of the vote, might have only 20%, but it might
                    be much more militant. So it was not a bad solution for Italy at that particular
                    time to have this rather cautious bureaucratic Enrico Berlinguer, an able
                    politician in some ways but not someone who was going to fundamentally change
                    the direction of the Italian communist party, which was in slow decline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the analysis of why was 30% of the Italian
                        population voting communist? I always used to have a problem. Every time I
                        came over from Yugoslavia and see these signs in your old area of Italy
                        saying, “Vote the Cominista,” and I would think, “Good God fellows, just go
                        across the border and take a look, it doesn't work very well.” What was your
                        analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, for starters, historical reasons, the communists in many areas
                    helped form the backbone of the resistance movement to Fascism. There were also
                    Christian Democrats and Socialists who were anti-Fascists, and also there were
                    Christian partisan elements as well as communist elements. But, as in
                    neighboring Yugoslavia, it was the Italian communists who formed probably the
                    largest, most active, and in some areas the most successful units, and who
                    actually took control in some areas until Allied forces arrived. It was Italian
                    communists who captured Mussolini for example and executed him. So the first
                    part of the answer is that at the end of the war you had a lot of Italians who
                    had fought with partisans, or appreciated what the partisans had done. The party
                    had an able leadership and were well organized. Their dominance in the labor
                    movement was very strong. Even into the '70s the communist segment of the labor
                    movement was by far the largest. And they had a strong base in central Italy.
                    Their record there of governance was good, and in fact it mostly continues to be
                    governed by leftist coalitions. As far as I can recall, there had never been a
                    non-communist government in either Tuscany or in the Emilia-Romagna, two of the
                    wealthiest and perhaps best administered regions in all of Italy. So that added
                    to their appeal as well. They were much less strong in the south, and in the
                    northeast, in Friuli, for example, they were not a significant force. So
                    basically they had a strong regional base that they had inherited as result of
                    the war, and as the result of taking over a lot of local administrations, and
                    running them fairly well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The CDU was very much caught up with internal power concerns. It was
                    really a coalition of factions. The Italian communists had their factions too,
                    but at that time they played much less of a role than the CDU factions did. My
                    colleagues who worked with the CDU were struck by some of the things that
                    ultimately came to undo the party, corruption being one. And as I say, these
                    personal power struggles among the barons of the parties who seemed to spend
                    more time figuring out how to get one up on their fellow CDU member as to
                    competing with other political parties as any kind of a united force.</p>

                        also very much undo a government, it's a sign of weakness among other
                        things. But at the same time if you over-report on the thing, it can have
                        consequences you really don't like back in Washington. I mean, you can play
                        that note too often. It can mean you almost can't deal with the government.
                        Did you find that you as one of the reporting officers find corruption a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Even then there were occasional episodes of communists in local
                    administrations involved in bribery and more have come to light in the 90's. But
                    to my knowledge no national PCI leaders were implicated in the line of
                    corruption that has so tarnished the socialists and (former) CDU. I will relate
                    one episode that goes back to 1976 when I was in Trieste. Aldo Moro,
                    subsequently murdered by the Red Brigade, was then Prime Minister and was making
                    overtures to the Italian communists, that caused us concern. And I remember that
                    all of the principal officers who were down for a principal officers conference
                    in Rome, and they called all of us in to a secure room, and the station chief
                    said, “We of course don't want this passed on to anybody, but you guys should
                    know that Aldo Moro is involved in...” and he described some episode of
                    corruption, or apparent corruption. And we left figuratively sort of scratching
                    our heads, and finally came to the conclusion that we were not supposed to take
                    seriously the part about “now of course we don't want you passing this on,”
                    because there was otherwise no reason for him to tell us this information. But
                    it showed that we were prepared to use corruption allegations against people who
                    we thought were endangering aspects of our policy, even if they were the Prime
                    Minister and a member of a party that we otherwise supported.</p>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. I have to assume though that since there was not much else said
                    at that brief meeting, he had gotten clearance from the front office to do that.
                    I'm not sure he would have done it strictly on his own.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Bologna. Yes, that was a rightist group. The Italian communist party,
                    I think, was as genuinely concerned about the Red Brigades, viewed them as a
                    threat; would even share information to the extent that they had any, not that
                    they had a lot of detailed information on the Red Brigades. These extremist
                    leftist groups were as suspicious of the Italian communist party, as they were
                    of any of the other big parties, viewed it as having sold out long, long ago.
                    One of the first telephone calls that came in when General Dozier was kidnapped
                    was to me from one of the top leaders of the Italian communist party who was
                    their expert on terrorism to express shock and dismay and offer any support and
                    help they could provide. They regularly denounced it in their press, and I think
                    that they genuinely saw it as a threat to themselves. There might have been a
                    few people who thought there were surreptitious links. I never saw any evidence
                    of that or believed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These relatively new links that were between the American
                        embassy and the Italian communist party; what were they getting from you,
                        and you getting from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: What they were hoping to get from us, and got to a limited extent in
                    those three years, was simply a sign that they were no longer considered beyond
                    the pale. In other words, a sign of a degree of respectability because they knew
                    that a part of the obstacle that they faced in increasing their share of the
                    vote, was that a lot of the Italians viewed a strong Italian communist party as
                    incompatible with good relations with the west, and with the United States in
                    particular. And anything that could soften that image and indicate that we
                    viewed the Italian communist party as a democratic party at least to the extent
                    that we accepted their participation in the political process, was in their view
                    helpful. So one of the things that happened in that period was that for the
                    first time an official Italian communist party got invited to the ambassador's
                    Fourth of July big, huge reception. That was actually not so much my doing
                    because I didn't have strong feelings one way or the other. My boss, the
                    political counselor was adamantly opposed. Gardner had brought over Joe
                    LaPalombara, who stayed on after Gardner left. Joe had been the head of the
                    political science department at Yale and was considered one of the leading, if
                    not the leading, U.S. experts on Italian politics. And he had a particular
                    interest in the Italian communist party. And he made the political counselor
                    extremely uncomfortable because he suspected that the ambassador was using Joe
                    as an alternative conduit to the Italian communists. So one of my tasks given me
                    by the political counselor was to keep an eye on Joe, keep him honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Cultural attach�. But his background was not in cultural affairs, it
                    was political analysis. He had written a number of books on the Italian
                    political process. One of my sources of satisfaction in my three years there
                    was, I think, despite Joe's academic background and really much longer in-depth
                    experience in Italy...I think I stayed at least a step and a half ahead of him
                    on developments in the Italian communist party. I remember making a bet with him
                    at the time of the Italian communist party congress as to how it was going to
                    come out. It was a pleasure to collect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we getting from our contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We were getting a much better sense, I think, than we had before of
                    what this animal was like. We were exposed to a wider range of the leadership. I
                    think our reporting became much more focused and accurate. We were able to call
                    election results pretty closely. I remember predicting that the Italian
                    communist party would lose a couple of percentage points in the '83 elections,
                    and this was within a percentage point or two of the actual results. So we had a
                    better sense of the party. They had some awfully smart and acute people and I
                    think we gained insights, not only into the party itself, but over the whole
                    spectrum of the Italian scene. So I think it was very helpful to have been able
                    to tap into some of their key people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out into the field and talk the iron belt, the
                        red belt, to the communist leaders out in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, yes. I did. I never went south partly because the Italian
                    communist party in the south was not that strong, and also just time. But I did
                    get to the party's strongholds. And I would go out to Milan and together with
                    the deputy principal officer up there to meet with communist party officials in
                    other areas. So, everywhere the party was strong I tried to visit and get a
                    sense of the party at the grassroots level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the communist party at this time was there
                        anti-Americanism because we were the great opponents of communists around
                        the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I would say among the minority of the party that affiliated with
                    leaders who opposed Berlinguer, such as Ingrao, where base of support were
                    industrial workers in large factories who tended to inherit a kind of late 1940s
                    conventional communist thinking about the world. You know, the good guys are
                    Soviets and the Americans are the bad guys. That was the branch of the party
                    that we had the least contact with, and it was then and has remained a minority
                    and one that Berlinguer was able to contain, and not have to make too many
                    concessions to because they had nowhere else to go. The people who got too fed
                    up would join one of the small fringe groups. That was the only part of the
                    Italian communist party where there was any strong anti-Americanism. I think
                    within the groups who affiliated with the center, or the social democratic wing
                    of the Italian communist party, there was probably a lot of sympathy for the
                    United States as a democracy. They would be critical of aspects of our foreign
                    policy, Vietnam for example was strongly opposed by the Italian communist party
                    across the board. And there was concern about Reagan when he first came in. In
                    fact, I remember...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1981.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: 1981, and one of their senior officials wrote a signed commentary in
                    L'Unita, the party organ, calling it a black day in human history. I called my
                    closest contact who was a member of the executive committee, and I said, “Look,
                    you guys are trying to change your image, and trying to show that you're not
                    extremists...and this is the kind of thing you people are running.” The very
                    next day there was an unsigned and therefore more authoritative front page
                    editorial in effect apologizing for that statement, and saying we're not going
                    to rush to condemn anybody, and essentially withdrawing that commentary which
                    indicates that they were in fact quite sensitive to our perception of them, and
                    willing to make at least symbolic concessions to the point of backtracking
                    publicly, and in effect apologizing to their readers for an overly harsh
                    judgement which was kind of interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the most burning issues was with the missile
                        business, whether we could put in these essentially medium range missiles to
                        counter the Soviet missiles that came in. Again all of Europe was upset
                        because even though the Soviets started it, they didn't like the idea of
                        more nuclear weapons being put on the continent which we were doing. So
                        Italy became the key place to get acceptance. Did you get involved with this
                        as far as dealing with the communist party on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Although they would never use these exact words, it was pretty clear
                    to me from my contacts with them, and in discussions on this issue, that the
                    party, while not supporting deployment in parliament and making speeches saying
                    this is not the right response to Soviet misbehavior it was in fact conducting a
                    soft opposition. They did not get people out in the streets or use inflammatory
                    rhetoric. There were some local groups in Sicily that tried to conduct sit-ins
                    and that kind of thing. But it was obvious that the communist party was not
                    putting anything like a full press against deployment. It could have complicated
                    life for us and the Italian government had they gone all out. But either because
                    as part of their respectability campaign, or because they had their own
                    misgivings about Soviet actions, their opposition to the deployment of the
                    Cruise missiles was a very muted, soft opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for the attitude of the communist party
                        towards the Soviet Union at this time? The Soviet Union had invaded
                        Afghanistan, and Brezhnev who was the leader but he was obviously failing,
                        and he was very unimpressive, and disillusionment even within the Soviet
                        Union of the old system. Were you getting any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: They were very disillusioned, and had no illusions about the future.
                    One of their top leaders told me that the relations with the Soviets had been on
                    a downward spiral for a number of years. And he said, “I think it's going to
                    continue to go down,” because he did not see any signs they viewed that Soviet
                    leadership in many respects in the same way as we did in terms of sporadic, you
                    know, out of touch with reality, etc. So they were not inclined to listen to any
                    messages that the Soviets might have wanted to send them, would have been
                    received with great skepticism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the economic side? If they were going to

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: They were realists who saw the failure of the Soviet model clearly.
                    They pressed for greater emphasis on promoting technology, but showed no
                    hostility to the private sector at all. They would point to the fact that in the
                    areas of Italy where they ran regional and local governments, that the private
                    sector was doing very well indeed, thank you. They weren't going to change that
                    at the national level.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I worked with him well, I think. He called me in my first day or two
                    to say how happy he was I was there and that I was working in an extremely
                    important area. I mentioned that he gave me broad flexibility to take
                    initiatives, which I appreciated. An extremely intelligent man, had an acute
                    sense of the Italian political scene. He was complimentary and used my reporting
                    well. Bear in mind that he left only six months after I arrived. I guess the one
                    major complaint I would have was that he was reluctant to share very much of
                    what he got from his own meetings which he told me that he had, but was always
                    very, very careful to keep any of the content of it pretty much to himself. So I
                    had no more of a good feel as to what was coming out of these meetings, than
                    anyone else in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with Maxwell Rabb who was a completely different
                        type of person. Could you give a little bit of his background, and how he
                        dealt with the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. He was an attorney who had been in high government positions. He
                    had been secretary to the cabinet in the Eisenhower administration, and
                    obviously was a senior person in Republican party circles. When he picked up the
                    phone it was usually to call the White House, not to call the State Department.
                    And it was, of course, very useful to have an ambassador who had very good White
                    House ties. He made no pretense of having the kind of feel for the Italian
                    political scene that Gardner had. And he made a couple of early missteps that
                    even he recognized almost immediately were missteps. For example, he agreed to
                    meet by himself without anyone else from the embassy present with Bettino Craxi,
                    the leader of the Socialist party. Almost immediately after the meeting the
                    Socialists started circulating accounts of what was said by both sides at the
                    meeting that caused consternation. The ambassador was saying, “I never said
                    that,” and his staff, the political counselor, and the DCM said, “But when you
                    go to meetings and there's no one from the Embassy taking notes, there's nothing
                    for the record to indicate that what they're saying isn't true.” So I think he
                    got that point very quickly. Like a lot of people with his kind of background,
                    they want to try it on their own. They're a little suspicious of the career
                    people. They think they're too cautious, that the other side won't be as open
                    and frank if there's an embassy person there, and they have great confidence in
                    their own negotiating skills and think that maybe it will work better if I don't
                    take someone from the embassy. I think he learned a lesson from that episode,
                    and, at least to my knowledge, that didn't occur again.</p>
                <p>I'll mention an episode that at the time caused me some moments of slight
                    discomfort, and looking back now I have a slightly different view. We went to
                    pay an initial call on the Soviet ambassador. The Soviet ambassador was just
                    handling it as a courtesy call, and Rabb started what sounded to me like baiting
                    him a bit about Soviet policy, and how stupid it was for the Soviet government
                    to do the things that it was doing because they couldn't afford guns and butter,
                    while the U.S. could. The poor Soviet ambassador obviously didn't know what to
                    say because he didn't want to respond in a confrontational way, or perhaps he
                    privately agreed with Rabb. The points Rabb was making, of course, sounded quite
                    on the mark in light of what subsequently happened through the '80s.</p>

                        time in Italy but I was always rather dubious about the exquisite reporting
                        on the permutations within the chamber over who was on top. It was pretty
                        much the same people for the last 40 years almost, and we seemed to get down
                        and report this with great delight and I felt that maybe a young attach�
                        could have taken care of it as there was no real change or something like
                        that. What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, I think your point about our having perhaps more resources
                    devoted to the day-to-day tactical situation than was necessary is probably
                    right. We were the only embassy to have one person doing the communist, one
                    person doing the Socialists and another person doing the Christian Democrats.
                    That's not counting people who were doing political-military affairs and a lot
                    of other things. Almost every other embassy would have usually one mid-level
                    political counselor and a junior person under him. The Germans, French and the
                    others, weren't quite as well informed of all of the details, and they would
                    often check with us. We were kind of a resource for all of the NATO embassies
                    because we were following things in more detail. But they kept adequately
                    informed. Today finally I think there is serious attention being given in the
                    State Department to cutting back on the number of reporting positions in western
                    Europe given the fact that there is so much information out there from the press
                    and other sources, and if they're democratic countries why do we need to follow
                    every twist and turn of their internal politics. I'm certainly sympathetic to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on your time there. You'd been through
                        the northern earthquake and you came down to the southern earthquake. This
                        was the earthquake of November '80 in Ayellino and that area that killed
                        about 2,000 people. This is your first real look at the south in
                        action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: In the South I was not working directly very much with the local
                    officials. In Friuli I knew the regional officials, they were people I had
                    worked with already for two and a half years prior to the earthquake so there
                    were no big surprises there. I guess I just didn't have enough of the kind of
                    contact with Southern mayors and that sort of thing to make valid comparisons.
                    Zamberletti, of course, I knew from my previous assignment. He was a northerner,
                    and not a southerner. So because I was dealing mainly with federal officials and
                    not so much with local officials I probably didn't get a sense of that.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: I felt that at least for the time being the situation would not change
                    dramatically. I mentioned the fact that I didn't see the communist party as in
                    any position to make any kind of move to take over. I probably didn't appreciate
                    fully the potential strength of extra party movements based on primarily
                    regional concerns like the Northern League. Interestingly enough in my old area,
                    the Trieste area, where there had been a small movement that was outside the
                    traditional parties, and that did well. We were not tracking that closely at the
                    time. Maybe that was a mistake, maybe we should have been looking at it because
                    in the '90s it has certainly become a focal point. But that's post-dated, I mean
                    the important elements of that, post-dated my tour in Italy.</p>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, for the first four months approximately September through
                    December 31st of 1983, there was a civilian government in Nigeria, and civilian
                    governors in each of the provinces. On January 1 there was a military coup. I
                    seem to time my assignments in Nigeria to arrive with shaky civilian
                    governments, and to witness coups. The coup was a complete surprise. We had gone
                    out on an overnight camping with a number of the members of the British military
                    advisory group. The British had quite a substantial group, I think they had, 40
                    or 50 military advisers near Kaduna training the Nigerian army. We stayed
                    overnight, we got back early on January 1st, early in the morning and there's my
                    vice consul waiting for me saying that radio broadcasts had announced a military
                    coup. I said, how is that possible, I was just with the British military
                    advisors. They were quite embarrassed about how they could have missed it since
                    the coup was led by their present or former students. So from then until the
                    time of our departure there was a military government which then in turn got
                    overthrown by another faction, another military coup took place just after we
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This northern part of Nigeria, what made it tick?
                        Economically and tribally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, of course, it's the Islamic area. The northerners were used to a
                    much greater extent by the British as local rulers. The British tended in the
                    southern part of Nigeria to establish a more direct rule, meaning that
                    Britishers had the key administrative positions. When they conquered northern
                    Nigeria, they felt that the northern administrative tribal structure lent itself
                    to their playing a much more indirect role. So they would give the northern
                    Emirs and other rulers a lot of leeway in running matters. So the north felt
                    that they had, compared to southerners, much more of a tradition of rule, and
                    the history of Nigeria has largely revolved around southern reactions to
                    northern attempts to call all of the shots in the whole country. This
                    north-south rivalry has basically triggered all of the coups because the army
                    has tended increasingly to be dominated by the northerners. So that's kind of a
                    long way to answer your question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of relations did you have when you first arrived
                        with the civilian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Quite good. I should preface that with a brief description of my
                    actual arrival because that, I won't say set the tone, but I got off literally
                    with a bang as the result of an explosion that occurred while we were in the air
                    between Lagos and Kaduna. The consulate was installing a new fuel tank for the
                    generator in the back of the house and the workers managed to blow up the tank.
                    Three people were killed, two of them consulate employees, the third was the
                    welder who was actually doing the welding. The house burned down, so it was a
                    difficult arrival but we got full support from the local authorities, including
                    from the representative of the Nigerian security service which is usually quite
                    secretive and only would meet with designated liaison people. There was no
                    problem with any anti-Americanism. They were primarily concerned, at that time,
                    with their election process, which turned into one of the factors that helped
                    precipitate the coup that took place the end of December. Just prior to the coup
                    we had the up-grading of the post and the move...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From consulate to consulate general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, and also in that same period in my first four months I
                    was concentrating on moving us out of the building that we had been in since the
                    consulate opened which was in terrible shape. Some FBO people came and said it
                    was the worst Foreign Service facility they had ever seen. There were enormous
                    cracks in the walls, it was a bad location. All of the services were in terrible
                    shape. I had been asked by the African Bureau to see if I couldn't do something
                    to break the impasse that had lasted for five years of trying to get out of that
                    property. So that is what I was heavily focused on in those first months, and I
                    did succeed and we inaugurated our new consulate building I think literally days
                    before this coup. It was in December, so between September and December we were
                    focused heavily on these administrative tasks and moving the building. And then
                    we had an entirely new group to deal with. The governor was fairly approachable,
                    the new military governor, but everybody was extremely nervous and uncertain for
                    a number of months, and a lot of things had to be put on hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of a Nigerian type military rule
                        at that time because some military rules are one way, and some are quite
                        another. How did you find the Nigerian form at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, being in Kaduna, a northern city where a number of the leading
                    businessmen, and others, were in fact close to the people who had carried out
                    the coup, and somewhat sympathetic to the coup. I suspect the reaction to the
                    coup was very different if you were in Lagos, Ibadan or in Enugu. I think there
                    was a feeling that the civilians would be able to influence the military there.
                    This would be a transitional period, and that it would redound to the benefit of
                    at least that region. I didn't find many people there in Kaduna who were saying,
                    isn't this terrible. And also since there was not a great threat emanating to
                    the new leadership from that area, it was probably less harsh in terms of the
                    impact on the population. But I think that as months wore by, there was more and
                    more a grumbling about the military leadership which was eventually, as I
                    mentioned, overthrown in 1985, and you began to see signs of a kind of
                    paralysis, and stagnation. So the elite of Kaduna, the business elite, and some
                    of the religious leaders were becoming more and more openly restive about
                    military rule. The Nigerian army is a lot better at seizing power than in
                    figuring out what to do with it after they have seized it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Tom Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate as far as your relations with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had excellent relations. I had worked with Tom in Nigeria in my
                    first assignment. Tom was the number two in the economic section, and we got
                    along quite well. He was an excellent ambassador, traveled frequently to the
                    north. We were always delighted when he and Jane came to stay with us. He had an
                    excellent manner with the northern Nigerians. They appreciated his dignity, his
                    bearing was very sympathetic to the northerners. I think they looked forward to
                    and welcomed his visits as did I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have anything such as Peace Corps, AID projects in
                        your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had cut off aid, including Peace Corps in the 70's when Nigeria's
                    oil revenue started rolling in in a major way. So our AID mission was
                    essentially eliminated. I don't recall if there was one person there from AID
                    who was more of a regional person. There may have been a tiny AID office, but
                    there were no AID programs to speak of, and there was no Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the oil revenue working when you were there? Was
                        it getting to the north, or what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: They had used it to build a good road network, much better than when
                    we were there, but for the most part it was squandered either on showy
                    buildings, or simply going into peoples' pockets and then out into offshore bank
                    accounts. And you would still find even after these tens of millions of dollars
                    of oil and revenues had flown in, you would still travel into villages and see
                    terrible poverty and no sign that the poor were receiving any benefit at all
                    from this, except that it was easier to get there because of the roads.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major job besides getting yourself
                        re-housed, which is always a problem, but as far as American interests
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had a trade fair. It was actually the largest in Nigeria, and we
                    had a full-time commercial officer. So promotion of commercial activity was one
                    of our primary tasks, but that activity dropped off considerably following the
                    coup. Reporting on the political situation, our other primary task, also became
                    more difficult. Even though the governor would always see me, getting him to
                    speak frankly was hard and his civilian aides were pretty much, I think, kept in
                    the dark. The Nigerian military do not put a lot of confidence, at least on
                    sensitive matters, in their civilian staffs. So it was difficult to get inside
                    information. Probably our best sources were again, some of the business elites
                    who had dealt with westerners before. Many of them had spent years in the UK, or
                    the United States, knew the west and although they were not necessarily privy to
                    inside thinking they usually had some access to these people and could give us
                    some of their impressions. So that was helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Islam a major factor in your area? I'm talking about
                        from a political point of view because fundamentalism has become quite a
                        concern of ours. How about it in Nigeria at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, again, I would differentiate between the civilian period when I
                    think the role played by the Islamic leadership was to undermine confidence in
                    the secular political process. So indirectly, I'm not saying that they directly
                    encouraged the military to take over, but in terms of public attitudes they
                    helped lay the groundwork for a reaction against civilian rule. Anything that
                    would threaten in their view the Islamic character of their area of Nigeria,
                    they would be strongly opposed to. So any kind of a multi-party system they
                    viewed with great suspicion. During the period of the military leadership there
                    were indications that some of the military leaders were close to some of the
                    senior religious leaders, but how that played out was hard to say. And I had the
                    feeling that for the most part the military were calling the shots themselves,
                    and not relying heavily, but would pay deference to the more prestigious of the
                    religious leaders.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes. I would call regularly, for example, on the Emir of Zaria who was
                    the most influential leader in the area near Kaduna. The person who was the
                    preeminent religious leader for all of northern Nigeria was in his 80s, if not
                    90s, and extremely ill throughout the period I was there. He took a long time
                    dying, and that was one of the factors that reduced somewhat the influence of
                    religion because there was a vacuum there at the top. He was moribund, and
                    everyone else was jockeying for position to see who would replace him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There was some inter-communal violence that took place. Again, there
                    was a history of inter-communal violence in Nigeria between northerners and
                    southerners, and there was one episode of that that took place I think in '85,
                    shortly before we left. Beyond that, no, I think we've covered the main trends.
                    It was a period that began the steady deterioration that Nigeria has seen to
                    this day. Nigeria today is a country that we no longer have good relations with.
                    It's a country that continues in a state of political stagnation and paralysis,
                    and that process really got underway in that period in '85. So we were basically
                    frustrated observers of that. We had no particular levers to use to improve the
                    situation. We had no AID programs as I mentioned, and we would report on what we
                    saw, what was going on, but there wasn't a lot we could do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '85 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: To the National War College for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 17th of July, 1995. Bob we're picking up, we're now in 1995, you had
                    gone to the National War College, did you go there as a student? I like to catch
                    the feel for these war colleges. What were you doing? Which of the war colleges
                    were you at?</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was at the National War College at Fort McNair. I was taking their
                    national security program which is essentially the same program given to
                    military officers at the colonel and lieutenant colonel level who were
                    considered particularly promising, and civilians with foreign affairs agencies.
                    We had people from State, CIA, NSA, Commerce, Treasury, the Library of Congress,
                    and a few others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From '85 from the War College perspective, what was the
                        world you were looking at like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think that a lot of the focus in those years, that of course was in
                    the midst of the big defense buildup that started in the last year of the Carter
                    administration, and intensified in the following years with the Reagan
                    administration. At the same time there was a growing debate, a debate which is
                    still going on, about when is it appropriate to use U.S. military force. Caspar
                    Weinberger had come out with a series of criteria which I think that George
                    Shultz felt were too restrictive, related to such things as ensuring that there
                    was full public support. A lot of the program was designed to give military
                    people a broader exposure to the factors that impinge on national security
                    policy, and some of that is old hat to Foreign Service officers. What sticks in
                    my mind from that year were the debates over whether we were buying the right
                    things in the framework of what the missions for the military were going to be.
                    There was a lot of ferment over the 600 ship navy, and of course you get a bit
                    into inter-service disputes. But I think was perhaps the most relevant in terms
                    of what has happened since then, and my own involvement in issues like Bosnia,
                    were the issues that Weinberger was addressing in those years, mainly what
                    criteria are we going to establish, what degree of public support, when should
                    the President decide that our national interests are so much involved that we
                    will put American troops...this, of course, an aftermath also of the Vietnam
                    debate, and that whole experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel at that time about how the
                        military looked at the Soviet Union? Although nobody knew it, it was the
                        twilight years of the Soviet Union. It had about four more years to go, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I don't think that anyone foresaw the kind of dramatic changes that
                    began happening just in years immediately following '85, '86. What I recall is
                    the concern as to whether we were using our resources wisely in terms of what
                    the future challenges to the United States were going to be. Star Wars was
                    another big focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what Star Wars was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Star Wars was the project, the program that the Reagan administration
                    introduced to put up an anti-missile defense shield, sort of an ABM defense,
                    terribly expensive. In the discussions we had at the War College I would say
                    there were probably more criticisms expressed than very strong support. I think
                    the subsequent events indicate that it was perhaps not a wise investment shall
                    we say. If I remember correctly Edward Teller played a big role in convincing
                    President Reagan that this was something that would work, and that would free
                    the United States from the specter of a massive inter-continental attack. Well,
                    we spent a lot of money on it. I'm not sure how far it ever got, but you never
                    had much protection...we spent tens of billions on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other eras, sometimes there was a certain separation
                        between the Department of State and the military, and how they looked at
                        things. I'm thinking of Vietnam, there was some of the military thought,
                        gee, you guys got us into this thing, get us out, or something like that.
                        How did you find it when you were there? Any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I didn't encounter any strong hostility. I think certainly nothing
                    compared to the hostility that our military colleagues expressed towards
                    journalists. I was struck by how deep and pervasive the hostility towards
                    journalists are. I think they viewed us as colleagues who often served in
                    dangerous, difficult places, were at risk. They were sometimes a little puzzled
                    that our personal styles were sometimes different from what they were used to. I
                    think they tended to relate more to Foreign Service officers who had themselves
                    had military experience, could speak the military language. One of my State
                    Department colleagues had been a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and he was
                    immensely popular. Most of us were viewed as professionals who sometimes
                    espoused sort of strange ideas, or things that didn't come across in a
                    straightforward, forthright way that the military likes. But I didn't sense any
                    hostility towards our profession per se.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any attempt on the part of the War College to
                        deal with the problem of the press. In other words to say, the media is
                        here, and we're just entering the age of CNN which is news network
                        television which is everywhere. Wherever you battle from now on it's going
                        to be fought under its eye. I was wondering how they were dealing with
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: They devoted a lot of attention to it, and they were of course aware
                    that most of the people in their audience had anti-press feelings. They were
                    trying to counteract that to some extent because they pointed out that the press
                    is a reality, its virtually a fourth branch of government, and it's not in the
                    interest of the defense department or of the United States government to do
                    anything but relate to the press in as positive a way as possible. So they tried
                    to give some pointers, held lectures, seminars on that subject. They brought Sam
                    Donaldson in who bravely stood up...I think a lot of the military still, and it
                    goes back to Vietnam, blame the press for part of the tragedy there, which I
                    think is wrong. But that's the way they feel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in '86. Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I went to the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs as
                    director of the Office of Human Rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in mid-Reagan wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. That would have been '86, in the middle of his second
                    term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you find the Bureau of Human Rights? I mean
                        what role was it playing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Assistant Secretary, who had replaced Elliott Abrams who had moved
                    over from Human Rights to the Bureau for Inter-American Affairs, was Dick
                    Schifter, a neo-conservative Democrat who had served previously as a senior
                    official in AIPAC, American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, I believe it's
                    called. An extremely skilled lawyer. He was in a major Washington law office, I
                    can't recall which one, but was a senior partner, and came with a very strong
                    commitment, I would say to human rights and to pursuing a human rights agenda.
                    He tended to be highly focused in certain areas, and the Soviet Union was
                    certainly his first and foremost preoccupation. So we spent a lot of time
                    dealing with the issues at the period of political prisoners and the other human
                    rights issues, reuniting families, treatment of dissidents, and that sort of
                    thing. That was probably our single greatest preoccupation, but he was also
                    interested in assisting in the development of human rights in the third world,
                    particularly through institution creating, trying to get assistance both setting
                    up of stronger human rights institutions, but also he was a proponent of police
                    training, working with police forces, military, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning your focus in your job in human rights
                        was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Okay, let me just briefly explain the organization of the bureau
                    because that will help. We had three offices when I was there. One was an office
                    that dealt with the political asylum issues, they were fairly self contained.
                    Another was an office that dealt with what were called multilateral issues. They
                    dealt with United Nations, human rights, meetings and concerns as well as
                    institutions like the International Committee for the Red Cross.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The High Commission for refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Our office was the office of human rights and is now called the
                    Bilateral Affairs Office. We monitored human rights situations on a country by
                    country basis. We had human rights officers for each of the regional bureaus,
                    African, European, etc. They were our regional and country specialists, and were
                    the resources that the bureau would turn to when there was a bilateral human
                    rights issue, whether it's political prisoners in the Soviet Union, alleged
                    human rights abuses by the Contras in Nicaragua, what was happening in Peru.
                    Anything that had a bilateral focus was our responsibility. That's why at that
                    time our office had the broad overall title of Office of Human Rights.
                    Eventually the other offices complained, so it's now the Bilateral Affairs
                    Office as opposed to the Multilateral Affairs Office, which is maybe a little
                    clearer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of some of these independent agencies.
                        I'm thinking of Amnesty International, America's Watch, and I'm sure there
                        are other ones who deal with this as well as the media.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: First of all we relied a lot on some of the information that they were
                    providing, even though I think all of us to a greater or lesser extent, Dick
                    Shifter perhaps to a greater extent, felt that there was a degree of bias in
                    some of their gathering. There's no question that they did very often draw our
                    attention to things that might otherwise have gone unreported. And they often
                    had highly professional people, and a good network—in some cases better than our
                    embassies networks—of people who were reporting on human rights abuses. They
                    were also our most consistent and sometimes severe critics. The lawyers
                    committee for human rights would put out each year a critique of the State
                    Department's human rights report in which they would sometimes commend us for
                    having done a good job in a given country, but often would take us to task
                    usually for letting other foreign policy considerations cause us to ignore,
                    downplay, misrepresent, eschew, a human rights situation. During the time that I
                    spent in HA...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was there from June of '86 until I think June of '87, and I can say
                    a brief word regarding my early departure from there.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I think the area where we were getting, and justifiably, beaten on the
                    head and shoulders, was our reporting on Central America where for foreign
                    policy reasons, some legitimate, some maybe not so legitimate, we did in fact
                    have a double standard of tending to downplay, ignore, justify, human rights
                    abuses on the part of official organs or groups like the Contras which we viewed
                    as countering threats to democracy. Not all of the criticisms were always fair
                    and some probably stemmed from ideological bias. Still it's certainly safe to
                    say as a general rule that we were harder on human rights abuses by the left. I
                    should note that Dick Schifter was a close personal friend of Elliott Abrams,
                    and would always consult with him on controversial issues. They both came from
                    the same matrix, they were both neo-conservatives.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, and Dick was very close to that. He would even say there are very
                    important foreign policy considerations, and I think he would check with Elliott
                    Abrams. And I think that if Elliott felt strongly that we should back off from
                    something, then I don't think there was much resistance.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Let me preface that by saying I have the highest regard for Dick's
                    intellectual skills and commitment. He's obviously an outstanding lawyer and
                    negotiator, and he now has a high position in the National Security Council as
                    you probably know. I read that he's been appointed as our negotiator now trying
                    to help resolve, I believe it's the Cyprus issue, one of the Aegean area
                    disputes, and in that kind of context I think Dick can be superb. In his job as
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights his relationship with the other Assistant
                    Secretaries...I mentioned that he was very close to Elliott Abrams and friendly
                    with Chet Crocker, but I think with the others the relationship was more at
                    arm's length, and they frequently took umbrage at a lack of consultation. Now,
                    that may seem contradictory with what I described with regard to Latin American
                    affairs, but it's a fact that that was an area that was unique because of
                    personal ties and shared viewpoints. On other issues that he felt strongly
                    about, and particularly the Soviet issues, he did not have a high opinion of
                    what the regional bureau was doing. I think that Assistant Secretary Roz Ridgway
                    understood that, sensed that. I'm sure she got indications of it in various
                    ways. So I would say one of the big problems that we had was a constant battling
                    over what we should say, what our priorities should be with regard to human
                    rights in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>At a certain point that concerned me so much, and I felt the friction that was
                    being created was becoming time consuming, and a diversion. So I asked Dick
                    Schifter if I could try to negotiate a policy approach that both the European
                    bureau and HA could live with, a charter or an understanding. A pact as it were
                    between the two bureaus with an agreed set of priorities. I think he was a
                    little bit skeptical that it could be done but he said, well okay, I understand
                    what your concerns are and if you guys can come up with something, that's fine.
                    So I spent a fair amount of time with the person in the Office of Soviet Affairs
                    designated to negotiate this with me. It was the head of their bilateral office,
                    Louis Sell, and we spent many hours laboriously working on a series of drafts of
                    a human rights policy towards the Soviet Union. EUR agreed that this would be a
                    desirable thing, and nobody wanted to continue with sniping back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that up until then it had been pretty much on a
                        case by case thing and when it would come up it would be a new battle each
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, and as we progressed with a series of drafts, because I
                    was not empowered to do anything other than come up jointly with a document that
                    both Assistant Secretaries could live with. So I would come back and show the
                    drafts in progress to my immediate boss who was a Deputy Assistant Secretary,
                    and to Dick Schifter, because I knew that we had to keep Dick on board for this
                    thing. Anyway, he would look at these drafts and say, okay—not show a great deal
                    of enthusiasm, but also not often say, change this. Each time he had a specific
                    concern, and say, I can't live with this, we would go back and fix it.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>To make a long story short, after spending a lot of time on this, and coming up
                    with what looked like a very good solid document which went all the way up and
                    was enthusiastically approved in EUR, when it reached that point and he looked
                    at it—and there was nothing there he hadn't seen before—he said no. So at that
                    point of course I felt that my credibility with EUR was shot. They understood
                    what had happened, and didn't personally blame me, but at the same time I felt
                    that I had been put in an impossible situation. So shortly after that I was
                    approached by someone from the Bureau of Personnel about working there. I
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me talk a bit about Schifter and human rights. Here is
                        someone coming out of AIPAC which is almost a vehement supporter of anything
                        Israel wants to do. He comes from the New York Jewish community which is a
                        strong supporter of Israel. He's concentrating heavily on Soviet problems
                        which are very much Jewish dissidents, not completely but there is a very
                        strong Jewish element. How did he treat the problem of Israel? Its human
                        rights record has always been a cause of concern. We're talking about how
                        they treated the Arabs within their country, and also the Arabs in the
                        occupied areas of Palestine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: He devoted a lot of very close attention to it. Usually the chapter of
                    the country human rights report, which was the most difficult to negotiate, even
                    more so than the Soviet one, was the chapter on Israel. That was again something
                    that I this time more successfully worked many, many hours with the NEA Bureau,
                    with the Israeli desk. With regard to Israel he was certainly prepared to be
                    critical of actions that resulted from errors, mistakes. For example, cases
                    where Israeli troops had used excessive force, he felt very strongly that they
                    had to do a better job of disciplining their troops, and using non-lethal means.
                    He was prepared to have critical language inserted when Israeli troops had not
                    used all non-lethal means to control a crowd, resulting in fatalities among the
                    Palestinians. In other areas though I think he tried to dampen criticism of some
                    Israeli practices. I think that he was less willing to criticize the Israeli
                    legal system which some of the Palestinians felt was biased against
                    Palestinians. He was not an out and out 100% defender of everything the Israelis
                    did by any means.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about China? We're going through a very rough patch
                        with the People's Republic of China right now. I mean China has been
                        recognized for some time, a few years by this time; one, were you able to
                        get much information, and two, did we pussy foot around it, not to
                        overemphasize, or was there any problem with China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I don't recall China engaging Shifters attention, or the bureau's
                    attention, to nearly the extent of some of these other issues that I've been
                    mentioning. It was not ignored. A lot of the attention in that period focused on
                    Tibet and what was happening there. A lot of our actions were generated by
                    congressional interest. In fact, that was true of a great deal of what we did;
                    interested congressman would often be the stimulus for our looking into
                    something. But it was, of course, nothing like the intensive interest in Chinese
                    human rights that happened as the result of events leading up to Tiananmen
                    Square, and what happened somewhat later.</p>

                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I don't recall that as one of the areas where we came under particular
                    criticism as a bureau for our approach. There were no major turning points
                    during the period that I was there. And again, it was one of those issues that
                    was on the screen but not with a high profile for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Personnel from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I got moved over to Personnel in June of '87, and was there until May
                    of '89 when I started some brush up language training to go to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I was in charge of the office that counsels mid-level political cone
                    officers on their assignments and their careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find were the major thing that you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: My arrival there happened to coincide with the first year of full
                    implementation of a section of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, which you may
                    recall, had the new up or out provision whereby, when you reach the O-1 (colonel
                    equivalent) level you had to make a decision as to whether to compete for the
                    senior ranks. If you competed for six years and were not promoted into the
                    senior ranks, then you had to retire. And when that first went into effect in
                    the early '80s a lot of Class 1 officers, and particularly political officers,
                    did not realize how intense the competition would be for those promotions. So
                    virtually everybody at that time, whether they were highly competitive, (almost
                    everyone thinks they're highly competitive) were only somewhat competitive, and
                    even some who were clearly not competitive, applied for promotion because it was
                    considered somewhat shameful not to. It was not the macho thing to do. I think
                    there were even people who were afraid that their failure to apply would get
                    around and that they would lose out on good assignments. So almost everybody did
                    it, and as a result in 1987, which was six years after the law went into effect,
                    there were I think 106 O-1 officers of ages ranging from the mid-40s through the
                    mid-50s who suddenly were out. A number of these, had they not applied at the
                    first opportunity, would have still been able to stay in the Service. And some,
                    of course, could even have been conceivably promoted later on. I was given as my
                    first extracurricular assignment working with these officers, and with the
                    grievance staff, and with other bureaus, to find employment for them pending
                    their separation. A large number of them filed for what is called prescriptive
                    relief. They could file a grievance against their separation and ask for
                    prescriptive relief in the form of an interim assignment, something that they
                    could do until their grievance was acted upon. And I was the person in the
                    bureau who was responsible for finding gainful employment for these
                    approximately 100 officers, of all cones, they were not only from the political
                    cone, although the political officers constituted about half of the entire group
                    because they were disproportionally hit by this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find real work, or was it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, actually in most cases we found work. In a few cases it was
                    actually work which fully utilized their full range of skills. In other cases it
                    was jobs in Freedom of Information or other areas which was work that otherwise
                    the Department would have to use contractors. So it both provided some gainful
                    employment and also saved the Department a certain amount of money since we had
                    to, under the grievance system we had to keep these people on board, had to
                    continue to pay their salaries. It was better to have them working than not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you dealing with the problem of women officers, or
                        minority officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Not so much with the issues concerning the women's class action suit
                    because there were other people in the bureau who were dealing with that. In my
                    first months I prepared a proposal that was accepted regarding bringing minority
                    officers' interest in certain jobs to bureaus attention. In other words,
                    creating a system which by no means guaranteed, or reserved certain jobs for
                    minorities, but it made sure that bureaus would learn and would be advised of a
                    minority officer's interest in given jobs. It kind of put the bureaus in a
                    position where they could come back and say, well, look, we have an officer who
                    we feel is better qualified because of this, that or the other thing. But they
                    would have to go through that exercise of giving a reasonable basis for the
                    preference of non-minority officers. So I think it was somewhat helpful in
                    implementing the affirmative action agenda, which has since of course become
                    very controversial. It was less so at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing with this group of officers who were
                        caught by this new act. You were sitting there taking the temperature of a
                        significant number of people. What was the feeling about how the system was
                        working among the people you were dealing with would you say at that
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Obviously, many in this group were bitter, felt that they had been ill
                    served by the system; for various reasons that they should have been given a
                    better sense earlier on of what promotion opportunities were going to be like.
                    Many identified real mistakes that had been made. One of the things I found
                    working in Personnel is that the record-keeping was terribly shoddy. When I did
                    a close check of performance files prior to promotion panels meeting, I found
                    that one-third had such serious deficiencies that they could form the basis of a
                    successful grievance. Missing awards, in some cases missing reports that were
                    not accounted for, and that sort of thing. One-third is an unacceptably high
                    percentage. When I would come across something like that, I would inform the
                    officer involved. You were not allowed to tell someone that they had a winnable
                    case, but you could advise people that they should consult with either the
                    grievance staff, or the grievance adviser at AFSA to get an opinion on that.
                    Career development officers can alert people that there is a potential problem,
                    that they should follow up on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the system, where was the problem as far as
                        these missing things? Was it just shoddy work in the file room?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I'm sure there were a variety of reasons. When a piece of paper has to
                    go from an overseas embassy, and go through usually a bureau first, then over to
                    performance evaluation, and then into a file. Sometimes a file would be...if you
                    have two people with similar names, would be put into the wrong person's file.
                    There are hundreds of ways that a piece of paper can go astray.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: As soon as I saw that job on the list of openings in 1989 when my tour
                    was ending in Personnel, I got in touch with Warren Zimmermann who I had learned
                    was going to be the new ambassador there. Jack Scanlan was still there but was
                    already slated to depart. Fortunately I had gotten to know Warren through our
                    common interest in some of the Soviet human rights issues. Before taking a trip
                    out to Moscow as director of the Office of Human Rights which (I probably should
                    have mentioned this when I was talking about, but it was the first time that a
                    senior representative of the Bureau of Human Rights had been received in a
                    friendly and relatively open way by the Soviet bureaucracy, and it astonished
                    the embassy when that happened.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about that. This is what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: This is July “86, so it was just shortly after I had joined the
                    bureau. I had only been in the bureau for six weeks, or something like that. We
                    of course asked the embassy to set up appointments with human rights advocates,
                    dissidents as well as with the Soviet Foreign Ministry people dealing with human
                    rights. My predecessor had visited two years earlier and I think had gotten one
                    meeting with a fairly low level type in the ministry, and was treated quite
                    coolly.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I had not gotten word of what appointments had been set up until I arrived at the
                    Embassy. I went in to the political section and my control officer said, “It's
                    amazing.” I said, “What's amazing?” They said, we had asked for an appointment
                    with the person we considered your counterpart, who was a division chief. And
                    they came back with an appointment two levels above that, an assistant
                    secretary. And they said, we can't recall when there's been that kind of pumping
                    up on their part, usually we're lucky to get the appointment at the level we
                    asked for. They said, more than that you're also invited to a lunch in your
                    honor at the VIP facility that they have there, the Foreign Ministry's VIP guest
                    house, and they invited several other embassy people. And they said, that's
                    rarely happened with anybody and certainly not in the human rights area, maybe
                    in an economic area that's of interest to them. So they were quite intrigued,
                    and were also intrigued during my meetings with Soviet officials that there was
                    much less of the usual Soviet defensiveness when I raised issues of political
                    prisoners and other contentious issues. My interlocutors never resorted to the
                    argument, well that's just propaganda. They tried to engage to some extent in
                    serious discussions and accepted that these were legitimate subjects for
                    dialogue. It was quite a different atmosphere, although when I returned Dick
                    Schifter was skeptical that it would go much beyond atmospherics. He saw it as
                    part of a charm campaign. My sense, and I think in the embassy too, there was a
                    certain feeling that sentiments were shifting and that they might in fact start
                    to take some concrete actions, which they did start to take soon afterward. They
                    started to release some people who had been held up for a long time, and
                    increased the Jewish emigration numbers substantially. So it was the beginning
                    of the Gorbachev human rights revolution, that was one of the earliest signs of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you run into Warren Zimmermann at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. His job at that time was as Ambassador to the CSCE talks
                    in Vienna, and human rights were a major concern in that particular venue. So I
                    consulted with Warren. He asked me to do certain specific things while I was in
                    Moscow, particularly with some personal friends of theirs from the years that
                    they were in Moscow. We also addressed some groups together on issues of Soviet
                    human rights. So I think he had a generally favorable view of me, and I
                    certainly did of him. So it was to my advantage when the choice came up of DCM
                    in Belgrade. We both expected human rights to be a major point of our efforts
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you arrived in Belgrade when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: September of 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Yugoslavia in September of
                        '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was a period of great optimism. When I arrived it was the eve of
                    the first high profile visit of the new Yugoslav Prime Minister, Ante Markovic,
                    a Croat who had been chosen earlier that year. The reason for the optimism was
                    the events elsewhere in Eastern Europe that made it clear that communism was
                    crumbling. The Gorbachev revolution had taken hold. Communist regimes had
                    crumbled in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The same would happen in Romania just a
                    few months later, in December. There was a feeling that Yugoslavia was very well
                    poised to a model and in the vanguard of East European countries that were
                    shedding communism. Markovic was already starting to allude to having
                    multi-party elections in Yugoslavia, which already had the most open economic
                    system in Eastern Europe. They had had a more western orientation, more of their
                    businessmen had been exposed to capitalism. So there was a feeling that
                    Yugoslavia was going to be the first East European country to join the Common
                    Market, and was going to help to show the way to the others. Well, how wrong can
                    you be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the embassy and the consulate general in
                        Zagreb...what did we have there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: In terms of staffing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Staffing, and you're in charge of running it. What was
                        your appraisal of our presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We had a sizeable embassy given the size of the country. Yugoslavia
                    had always attracted a lot of U.S. attention over the years. Initially in '48
                    because of its break with the Soviet Union. A lot of the programs that we were
                    running, like the Fulbright program, were among the largest in Europe. I think
                    only Germany had a larger Fulbright program, and on a per capita basis ours was
                    way way ahead of everybody else. And they was a lot of coming and going,
                    Americans liked to come to Yugoslavia for a number of reasons. So it was a busy,
                    active embassy. We had about 100 Americans in Belgrade, and about 350 Yugoslav
                    employees. In Zagreb they had about a dozen Americans, and maybe 60—I'm not
                    certain now of the number of FSNs. So these were sizeable operations that we
                    were running there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back to September of '89, how did we view the
                        problem of ethnic diversity division at that time. What were we seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Even before '89, there had always been concern over the viability of
                    the system that Tito left behind, whether it could contain centrifugal forces
                    which were obviously strong. There was growing hostility between Slovenia and
                    Croatia on the one hand, and Serbia on the other. Tito's system as it evolved in
                    the years since his death, had given more and more power to the individual
                    republics and less and less to the federal government. To the point where we all
                    knew that the greatest threat to the optimistic scenario I just described was in
                    the unwillingness of the republics to allow the federal government to implement
                    coherent policies. So our efforts in 89-90 was to try to bolster Markovic, whom
                    we saw as the best hope, maybe the last hope, because if he failed the prospects
                    were very gloomy. He seemed at that period, in the summer and early fall, to
                    have the kind of leadership abilities that gave him a fighting chance to
                    overcome the systemic problems of heading a government with very little power,
                    with only the powers that the republics were willing to let him exercise. He
                    went to the United States and made a good impression. As a person he was dynamic
                    and knew how to talk to westerners. The only doubts were would he be allowed to
                    carry out a meaningful reform program in Yugoslavia. And in the succeeding
                    months it became clear that it probably wasn't going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something you said, we wanted to support Markovic. How do
                        we support somebody? What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: First of all by having him meet with the President. That's one way of
                    showing support to a leader of a...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be George Bush at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's correct...through the kinds of things that the spokespersons
                    for the administration say about him. In succeeding months as he got more and
                    more embroiled in difficulties there were other attempts. For example, at one
                    point I remember Bush calling him up to express his support for him, and that
                    information was released publicly that the President of the United States had
                    called him. And we did begin in those months preparing an aid package for
                    Yugoslavia. I remember going to Vienna to a regional meeting of all Eastern
                    European DCMs, and AID directors, to discuss what kind of an aid package would
                    be appropriate. The amounts earmarked for Yugoslavia were not very large. I had
                    been, as DCM, in charge of preparing the recommendations for what areas we were
                    going to assist. But even at that point, even in December of '89, I told the
                    chair of the meeting who was Bob Barry, who was in charge of the office that was
                    established to implement AID programs in Eastern Europe, that we should not
                    actually dispense aid yet for Yugoslavia until it became clear that the severe
                    breakdown in relations between the republics and the federal government showed
                    some signs of improving. Because otherwise you were giving money to an entity
                    that was not functioning. And in fact in succeeding months things got worse
                    instead of better so we never really went forward with any concrete aid. That
                    infuriated Markovic because he kept saying, what good is your rhetorical support
                    if you can't come forward with hard cash. But it's very hard to justify in a
                    situation where the IMF and other international institutions, and our own
                    analyses, were that the federal government was impotent. It reached the point,
                    for example, where Slovenia was not turning over to the federal government the
                    customs duties that it was collecting for goods that were entering Slovenia.
                    They were keeping them.</p>
                <p>In late November of '89 the Serbs instituted an economic boycott of Slovenia.
                    This within a country that is nominally united. In my own mind that was the
                    clearest evidence that Yugoslavia was probably on a rapid downward spiral in
                    terms of unity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the political reporting, were we in touch with the
                        governments of the various republics, and if so what were we getting from
                        them? What were they talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There were three groups of republics. On the one hand there was
                    Slovenia and Croatia who at that point were starting to head hell-bent towards
                    independence at the earliest possible date. There were the first free and open
                    elections took place in Slovenia and Croatia in the spring of '90, and both
                    brought into power groups that were clearly headed in the direction of
                    independence. Even before those elections it was clear that that's the way
                    things were trending, but the elections intensified that process.</p>
                <p>Anyway, you had those two northern republics. You had Serbia which basically
                    would have liked to have been rid of the northern republics, felt strong enough
                    to dominate the remainder, and so was not about to pay a price to keep the
                    country together.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>And then you had the other republics who basically were terrified of what a
                    breakup would mean, Bosnia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. Montenegro was too much
                    in Serbia's shadow to really do much more than wring its hands. But the two
                    leaders who worked the hardest to try to keep a form of Yugoslavia together were
                    Izetbegovic in Bosnia who was elected in November of '90, and Gligorov who
                    became the leader of Macedonia in '91. Unity became more difficult to maintain
                    with the demise of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia which formally broke
                    up in February of '90. Its power crumbled very rapidly, but the underlying
                    interests of the republics at that period were more or less as I've described
                    it, namely two who only wanted to leave. One which was somewhat happy to have
                    them leave provided in the case of Croatia that they didn't try to take Serbs
                    with them. The Yugoslav constitution provided for secession but not secession of
                    republics. Secession of ethnic groups, of nations as they called it, narodi. The
                    Serbian argument was if Slovenes as a nation wished to leave Yugoslavia it's in
                    the constitution that they have that right. If Croats want to leave, essentially
                    as Croats, that's fine. But, and this becomes now one of the root causes of the
                    wars that sprung up, that they do not have a right to take Serbs with them. The
                    Serbs have the same right of self determination as anyone else. That in a
                    nutshell was the Serbian position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing the rise of Serb nationalists around?
                        Before the cry had been brotherhood and unity. Were you seeing this as being
                        sort of the ethnicity of being...this first thing that allowed politicians
                        to get out there and make a mark for themselves. I'm a Serb, or I'm a Croat.
                        Did you see this becoming a political ploy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That was really what Milosevic used to gain unchallenged power and in
                    Serbia the nationalist drive was initially focused on Kosovo. That was his first
                    dramatic moment was when he in a speech in Kosovo made a very impassioned
                    statement about Kosovo and the Serbs, and Serbian pride, etc. It had a great
                    resonance in Serbia. Up until that point he had been viewed as a typical
                    apparatchik. Maybe a little more professionally qualified in the area of banking
                    than some of the others. By the way, I don't know if it's generally known that
                    he had had an IVP grant in the field of banking back in the mid-80s I think, he
                    went to Chicago and other cities. But his primary focus was always political,
                    and he pursued power in a very single minded way, ruthless way. He used
                    nationalism as the means for this.</p>
                <p>I think most of the analysts see this as opportunistic on his part. In other
                    words, that he simply made a calculated decision that here was the right button
                    to push. I do think there is a somewhat of a messianic streak in Milosevic, that
                    he genuinely sees himself as a kind of savior of Serbia. He is an extremely
                    skilled cold-blooded politician who combines that, contradictory as it may
                    sound, with a genuine feeling that there is no one else who can defend, protect,
                    promote the interests of the Serbian nation other than himself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>I might just put in a qualifier, prior to that, American interests when I was
                    there, and when you were there the first time, we didn't want to see Yugoslavia
                    split apart because this would give an opening for the Soviet Union and could
                    mean World War III because it was one of those places as long it held together,
                    and was somewhat out of the Soviet orbit, it meant that they wouldn't be
                    attracted, and we wouldn't be attracted and we wouldn't get into fighting with
                    them. A very clear interest, but now things are changing.</p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, and what we eventually came up with to replace the
                    former Trinity, which consisted of independence, unity, and territorial
                    integrity (through the '60s, '70s and most of the '80s, we would repeat that as
                    kind of a mantra) was a duality-unity and democracy. As we saw it, if either
                    were suppressed or shattered, you couldn't have the other. In other words, you
                    could not in the context of a split, a destruction of the Yugoslav state, you
                    would not have democracy because it could not happen peacefully given the ethnic
                    tensions, given the structure of the country. You didn't have groups neatly in
                    areas that if you drew borders around them, they'd be more or less content to be
                    there. In particular the Serb and Croat population was scattered and the Muslims
                    were intermingled, not in a well defined separate area. Anyway, we argued
                    forcefully that our policy should be based on support for both unity and
                    democracy, and emphasizing the interdependence of the two. At that time, the
                    Slovenes and the Croats were making the argument that what Milosevic wanted to
                    do was to impose a non-democratic system. While he may talk a less communist
                    game now that he sees the handwriting on the wall for communism in Eastern
                    Europe, he's basically a Bolshevik at heart, so you should view Serbia as a
                    threat to a democratic Yugoslavia. There was certainly something to be said for
                    that argument. But what we were promoting was the concept that you could not
                    have a survival of democracy in a chaotic breakup of Yugoslavia. Unlike the
                    CIA's analysis that got into the press which said that a breakup of Yugoslavia
                    was inevitable within 18 months. (It turned out to be pretty close to the mark.)
                    Our view was that a breakup of Yugoslavia was not inevitable but was a strong
                    probability. In February 1990 I told Ambassador Thomas in Budapest that the odds
                    were 3 to 1 against Yugoslavia staying united at that point. But, CIA felt that
                    there was a chance of getting a peaceful agreement on separation. We were very
                    skeptical of that in the embassy. We felt it almost inevitable that we were
                    going to have widespread violence which would, of course, undercut
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>As the months went by the process of the republics taking more and more away from
                    the Federation accelerated. Milosevic badly mishandled the political process, to
                    the point where he antagonized all major groups except for a small number of
                    intellectuals. His leadership became very faltering and uncertain. So he was a
                    political ghost long before he formally left office.</p>

                <p>In those last months you had the visit of Jim Baker, Secretary of State. It was

                    countries as to what policies to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting. What were you getting from the
                        other missions there? I'm thinking particularly of German, French, British,
                        maybe Italian, and at that time it was still Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Some in the United States thought we were hanging on too long to a
                    forlorn hope that Yugoslavia could stay together. We were actually the first of
                    the major missions in Belgrade to draw attention to the seriousness of the
                    possibility of the disintegration of the country. I remember, for example,
                    calling on my counterpart at the Soviet embassy who was one of their most
                    experienced Yugoslav hands. He had spent at that point something like 12 years
                    in the country, and was five years into his current tour as their DCM. He told
                    me that the harsh rhetoric the various ethnic groups were using was just Balkan
                    hotheadedness, and should not be given too much weight. He was convinced the
                    army and other federal institutions would ensure that the country stayed
                    together. That was the basic assessment of most other missions in '89 and '90.
                    By the end of '90 and the beginning of '91, it was becoming very clear that the
                    country was falling apart. Warren and I had good relations with the heads and
                    the deputies of all of the western European missions who came to see things more
                    or less as we did. One exception was the Austrian DCM who had an animus against
                    Yugoslavia, so he was rooting for it to fall apart, saying its an artificial
                    country it should never have been existed. I think he took assassination of
                    Archduke Francis Ferdinand personally. He was an odd man out. In the light of
                    what happened from the middle of '91 until early '92, and the role that the
                    Germans played in pressing for early recognition of Croatia-Slovenia, it's
                    interesting that that was strongly opposed by their ambassador in Belgrade. And
                    according to articles that I've read, and other information that I've gotten,
                    also by all of the professionals at the foreign ministry...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it because there's a Croatian community in
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was a little more complicated than that. It was based in the first
                    instance on personal biases of some very influential friends of Kohl. The editor
                    of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, whose name escapes me at the moment, had
                    been a correspondent of the paper for Germany in Belgrade in the '50s and had
                    developed a deep and abiding dislike of the Serbs, partly based on some
                    unfortunate encounters that he had had. The German media in general seized on
                    developments in Yugoslavia which was familiar to many tourists. As the fighting
                    started, the public started seeing scenes of refugees, scenes of some of the
                    atrocities that started happening at the time. We're still seeing them today,
                    the kinds of scenes that caused great public anguish. So the combination of this
                    one influential newspaper's strong pressure combined with growing public outrage
                    over the things like the bombing of Vukovar, and the shelling of Dubrovnik,
                    which were creating a climate that facilitated Germany's going against what
                    would otherwise have been a consensus of NATO countries. To the genuine dismay
                    of the French, British, and ourselves the Germans announced unilaterally that
                    they were going to recognize Croatia and Slovenia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say that when I heard this as an observer, there is
                        nothing that would raise the Serbian animosity level than Germans and Croats
                        getting together. You'd have thought that Germany would have played it
                        smart, as you'd have thought the Pope would have played it smart, who also
                        got into the act. The rise of Tudjman in Croatia, how did we view him, and
                        what were we seeing with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Here there were probably at least some differences of emphasis in
                    terms of the views of our consulate general Zagreb, and the embassy in Belgrade.
                    Although the consul general, Mike Einik always reported professionally, there
                    was naturally more sympathy for the emerging Croatian argument for independence.
                    As far as the activities of Tudjman's party, what was most disturbing was the
                    reliance on arming party members. The argument was that the Serbs were arming in
                    their areas, and that this was just defensive. I suspect there were some areas
                    where there had been clandestine Serbian arms shipments, but the scale of the
                    Croatian action, and the fact of its having official blessing greatly ratcheted
                    up the tensions, and caused an increase in the arming on the other side as well.
                    So it represented a major shift in the direction of a violent outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy try to do anything with Tudjman and
                        Milosevic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, the problem was not that Tudjman and Milosevic were not getting
                    together. The problem was that they were getting together. In a secret meeting
                    that we only found out about subsequently they met in Serbia and agreed to
                    divide Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia. We confronted both men with this. They
                    made somewhat halfhearted denials that they did anything like that. But the
                    information was pretty solid, and reliable, and nothing that happened
                    subsequently would lead me to question whether the reports we got of that
                    meeting were not accurate. My feeling was that each played off and benefited
                    from the other, so each would have been dismayed had the other been replaced by
                    someone else. I mean, for Tudjman, Milosevic was the ideal leader of Serbia. He
                    was viewed as a communist which made Tudjman look good by comparison. He could
                    portray him as the bogey man, and used that to discredit attempts to deal with
                    in a serious way the grievances of the Serbs—how can you deal with these
                    Bolsheviks, and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>At the same time Tudjman felt he could deal with Milosevic on issues like Bosnia.
                    It was kind of the equivalent of the Nazi-Soviet pact over Poland really, they
                    quietly agreed to divide it up. And from Milosevic's standpoint it was kind of
                    the same thing. Tudjman delighted in evoking memories of Croatia's unsavory past
                    and his anti-Semitism and authoritarianism made him unpalatable to many. So each
                    one was a polarizing figure for the other side. At the same time I think
                    Milosevic felt some contempt for Tudjman, and felt that he could wrap him around
                    his finger whenever the two of them did get together. I remember a west European
                    diplomat who had traveled back with Milosevic and the army leadership from one
                    of the series of meetings that were arranged by the European community among the
                    presidents of the different republics, and he said that Milosevic was being very
                    open about how stupid he thought Tudjman was, and how he had completely fooled
                    him in these talks that they had just had. And he and the army leaders were
                    laughing about Tudjman, they had very little regard for his intelligence or
                    abilities. I must add, though, that in Bosnia, Tudjman played his hand more
                    shrewdly than Milosevic, avoiding sanctions while pursuing essentially identical
                    policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice at the time...something that has become
                        either apparent, or at least seems to be apparent, that is the complete lack
                        of veracity or the interest in veracity on the part of the leadership. At
                        least I get that feeling. Did you have that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I had served six years in Italy, and I never assumed veracity from any
                    quarter any time. But there is a difference in the grade. I would have to say
                    that with long experience, I think, there's no question that Milosevic could
                    look you in the eye and tell you something that you knew, and he probably knew
                    that you knew, was outright falsehood. I mean he would have no compunction in
                    doing that. So the only way around that is to find out enough about the issues
                    he was talking about to do a kind of reality check on what he was saying. The
                    point is certainly true that neither of those two men hesitated from, in some
                    cases, denying what was obvious or generally known. Tudjman for a while denied
                    that Croatian troops were in Bosnia when there had been dozens of credible
                    reports that they were, and I think he finally admitted that perhaps they were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before this thing really blew up were we sending out our
                        people around the country and to find out whose doing what to whom? What
                        sort of reports were we getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Both we and Zagreb were sending people into some of the areas which
                    seemed to be flashpoints, into the Krajina area, for example. The consulate
                    general did an excellent report. We sent people a number of times into Bosnia.
                    The problem with reporting isn't that we didn't go out, is that it was hard to
                    really get at the areas where some of the worst problems were happening, which
                    were not in the larger cities. In other words, we had a pretty good take on
                    Banja Luka, Mostar, Sarajevo obviously. But if I had to assess the overall
                    performance, it's that we didn't get enough of a sense of the village level
                    realities, because it's hard both in terms of time, in terms of communicating
                    with peasants who just aren't used to talking to foreigners. If you went to a
                    city you can find a lot of people who were interlocutors. The extent to which
                    the conflict became an urban-rural conflict is described by Misha Glenny in his
                    book, which I think is the best...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Failure of Yugoslavia. It starts off at the very beginning saying
                    that Tudjman himself missed that reality, he was relying on what he heard from
                    Serbs in Zagreb who were not in touch at all with Serbs who were down in
                    villages in the Krajina, that he was simply out of touch with that reality. I
                    think that was largely true of the diplomatic missions as well. You tend to talk
                    to people who are more accessible. For example, the majority of the Serbs who
                    lived in the larger cities, and tended to be the more articulate, and who tended
                    to be the ones that western diplomats would talk to, would say reassuring
                    things, things that would give you a more optimistic view of what things...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Badly. Baker felt that his message was basically not getting through.
                    I know that his people felt very strongly that the Yugoslavia issue was a can of
                    worms, that it was worse than the Middle East, and there was absolutely no
                    inclination, I think, on the part of Baker or his people to put the United
                    States in the lead role. I agreed with Baker's decision to let the Europeans run
                    with the ball, because at that period the European community was trying to
                    hammer out a common foreign policy, and they viewed this as their first
                    opportunity for the European community to take a lead role on a major
                    international crisis, and to help solidify and forge a unified foreign policy
                    for the community. Unfortunately, for reasons that I've partly alluded to
                    already, that unity fell apart rather quickly. At that point, I think, Baker's
                    attention, the President's attention, was really focused elsewhere and there was
                    no inclination to step in, which would have been hard to do anyway, and say,
                    okay Europeans, you've blown it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he playing any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, very much so. In fact, one of the ironies that I often mention
                    about this crisis, is that we had probably never had the degree of expertise at
                    the highest levels of our policy-making structure as we did for the Yugoslav
                    crisis. There was Eagleburger who had served there for something like six years.
                    He had been there as a junior officer, had been ambassador, and followed it very
                    closely as Assistant Secretary. And you had Brent Scowcroft as the National
                    Security Adviser who had served there as a military attach� back in the '50s. So
                    you had two experts at the very top which is almost unheard of. It certainly
                    wasn't true in Vietnam or any of the other major foreign policy crises. And I
                    think Eagleburger would be the first to admit that we did not produce, despite
                    that expertise, we were not able to devise a policy that ameliorated the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this thing was going, you and Warren were sitting there
                        looking at this, did you see a policy? I mean really the role of the United
                        States. I mean we can huff and puff, but did you see something that made
                        sense that maybe we could have done, or the Europeans could have done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Are you talking about my view now, or are you asking me to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, at that time, now we're 1995 and its much worse than
                        its much worse than it has ever been.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: When you're looking back, when you're trying to recall what your views
                    were at...I mean, you have to be careful you don't read back into your views at
                    that time conclusions you have subsequently come to. And I did not keep a
                    journal, I don't have access to notes, or reports of my views at that time. As I
                    say, we did support the policy of allowing the Europeans to try to work out a
                    negotiated peaceful solution to this, and we were dismayed at the German
                    position. I was dismayed that we had not been more active in helping the
                    majority of the EC counteract the Germans. In fact, within the State Department,
                    and one of the very, very difficult things that the Yugoslav crisis brought to
                    light...every organization that tried to deal with it almost immediately became
                    embroiled in internal arguments and disputes over what kind of policy to take.
                    And within the State Department there were people on the desk in key positions
                    who were very sympathetic to the German view, saying the Germans are right, we
                    should recognize the Slovenes and the Croats. That was not the formal United
                    States policy, but at this point Baker did not want to embroil himself with
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We got you to Yugoslavia and you were mentioning that
                        there were a series of crises you had to deal with, you being the embassy
                        and State Department. Could you enumerate the basic crises and then we'll go
                        back and look at each one as it developed. I mean the major ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Let me say first that I arrived in September of 1989 when there was
                    some cautious optimism that with a more dynamic and westward leaning federal
                    Prime Minister Ante Markovic, that there was a chance for Yugoslavia to stay
                    together. Markovic led a group of sort of western oriented reformers who
                    primarily focused on economic reforms, were hoping that in the context of a
                    post-cold war Europe a united Yugoslavia could be first of all be in the
                    vanguard of Eastern Europe economically and politically. Markovic within a few
                    months after my arrival was openly calling for multiparty elections which the
                    United States strongly supported. Markovic's only trip to the U.S. in October 89
                    was disappointing for him because he didn't get much in the way of concrete
                    indication of U.S. help, which showed that Yugoslavia was not very high on our
                    list of priorities. But he got some expression of goodwill and he had a meeting
                    with the President, and he got photo ops. We in the embassy were supportive of
                    Markovic, despite his faults. We believed that if he failed he was probably the
                    last chance, and things looked mighty dark after that because we didn't see any
                    other Yugoslav leader who could keep the country together.</p>
                <p>Now you mentioned the individual crises. The one that was probably at that time,
                    both for the embassy and for Washington number one, was Kosovo, where violent
                    confrontations had occurred between Serbian authorities and the Albanian
                    majority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 90% or 95%?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, 90% roughly at that time. It was an extremely emotional issue for
                    the Serbs. It was the issue that Slobodan Milosevic had really come to power on.
                    So I think until the actual outbreak of widespread fighting two years later in
                    connection with the Slovene-Croatian declaration of independence, Kosovo was
                    still an area that got a very large proportion of our attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say attention, what did the American embassy do about
                        it, and what general instructions were you operating under?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: First of all one of our main tasks was to accompany congressional
                    delegations. There were several key members of the Congress, and in the first
                    instance Senator Robert Dole who on his visits to Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia was
                    the subject that he took a very strong interest in, and still does to this day,
                    as you know. Kosovo was one of his main focal points, and he had on one of his
                    visits which had occurred just prior to my arrival, but which still had
                    repercussions long afterwards, he had addressed what turned into a mass rally of
                    Kosovo Albanians, and that led to a riot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about? Dole addressed the mass
                        rally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, he spoke and of course Albanians...his message was one of support
                    for the Albanians in Kosovo. It was a message that the Serbs didn't like, and
                    that the Albanians of course reacted very positively to. But in the context of
                    the tensions that were down there, it was understandable that the Serbs did not
                    view Dole with the greatest degree of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the conflict between the Albanians and the Serbs
                        and Kosovo goes back at least to 1379. But anyway, did you talk to Dole?
                        He's a presidential candidate now but looking at it at the time why would a
                        senator from Kansas get involved in such fiery issue, in a local issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I can't fully answer that, but one factor as we understood it is that
                    he has a very senior staffer who was very close to him. I do not recall her
                    name, its been years since I've heard it, she's a Croat but also has very close
                    ties to the Albanians and she had influenced him. Also I would say the Serbs do
                    have a way, almost a genius, of turning people off, of treating them, or
                    reacting to them in a way that further reduces even a small amount of sympathy
                    they might have for any arguments the Serbs were putting forward. The Serbians
                    had stripped the Albanian majority of the autonomy that they had been given
                    under Tito. Kosovo had been an autonomous province, had an Albanian leadership,
                    a communist leadership, and in the last analysis they were responsive to what
                    the national party decided. But in Kosovo itself the Albanians once they had
                    real political power were no more kindly towards the Serbs than the Serbs had
                    been towards them earlier. So in that part of the world you tend to use power to
                    help your own so the Serbs did have some legitimate grievances which they tended
                    to overplay. Still, any fair-minded person would say it was hard being a Serb in
                    Kosovo during the time when the Albanians were riding high.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this was a burning and emotional issue for the Serbs. It had the
                    practical effect, and here I would relate it to the other crises, it had the
                    practical effect of cutting off our access to Milosevic because when...well, one
                    of the first things that happened after Warren arrived, Warren Zimmermann,
                    arrived in March '89 as ambassador, and then on June 28th Milosevic orchestrated
                    a major commemoration in Kosovo which was designed to celebrate a number of
                    things. It was done on the anniversary of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1389.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: So this was a big deal and Milosevic had worked very hard and through
                    political pressures, had managed to get the other leaders of the republics in
                    Yugoslavia, to agree to constitutional changes that in effect ended the
                    autonomous status of Kosovo and returned it to simply being a province
                    within...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MIlosevic's position was what at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: He was the head of the communist party, but everybody looked to
                    Milosevic as the ruler of Serbia. He was never Prime Minister which is not a
                    very influential job, but he later became president of Serbia. Anyway, he was
                    able to get the entire federal establishment, and the heads of Slovenia and
                    Croatia, etc., all of them signed off on these constitutional changes and agreed
                    to come to this big celebration. But the western ambassadors boycotted the event
                    which got some news coverage, cast a shadow over this glorious moment, and as a
                    result for a long time after that Milosevic refused to see Warren in particular.
                    He rarely met with other western ambassadors either so it's not as if...I think
                    he held a grudge against the whole group. But he had a particular grudge against
                    Warren because in his view, and there was some indication of this, in his view
                    Warren had organized the whole thing. So he was definitely enemy number one, and
                    Milosevic absolutely refused to have anything to do with him. So that somewhat
                    cut us off to the extent that Milosevic would have in fact shared any of his
                    real thinking with Warren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived what was the situation vis-a-vis
                        Milosevic as far as the embassy was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: No contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes the DCM is not as tainted you might say with
                        policy. Could you go at a secondary level or something like that? I mean
                        below Milosevic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: You mean if we had something to communicate, or we just wanted to meet
                    with him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean do we have any ties to Milosevic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, to some of his people, yes. In other words, the political
                    section, or I would sometimes meet with people who were rumored to be close to
                    Milosevic. But Milosevic had very many few real confidants. There were a lot of
                    bureaucrats who worked for him. It was not hard getting the official line. That
                    was easy to get. We could meet with Serbian party officials and get the official
                    line anytime we wanted. We were inundated with the official lines. Getting some
                    kind of genuine personal insights was much more difficult. We tried but we were
                    for a long time not successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Parenthetically I was interested to see that Bob Frasure had been able to
                    establish what the press called a good rapport with Milosevic. He was the
                    special envoy who tragically was killed in an accident a few weeks ago. I met
                    with Milosevic one-on-one on two or three occasions and was with other senior
                    U.S. officials who called on him, such as Cyrus Vance, U.S. senators, Reg
                    Bartholomew when he was special envoy. I don't think that any of those meetings
                    could be really characterized as having good rapport with Milosevic. I felt that
                    I could have written the script before the meeting. Nevertheless, it is
                    important with someone who has the power and the influence that Milosevic has,
                    to have that direct contact. And you know, that I am pleased that apparently one
                    part of our current, more active, policy is to frequently see Milosevic and try
                    to build a rapport with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at this critical time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was his decision, we were not boycotting him. In fact Warren was
                    repeatedly looking for opportunities but Milosevic was adamant that he wasn't
                    going to have anything to do with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our judgment at that time. Who is this guy
                        Milosevic? What motivated him as far as we were looking at him at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: We did not feel that his nationalism was necessarily genuine, but that
                    he was simply using this to increase his own personal power. His background had
                    been as a communist apparatchik, and a very able one. Nobody underestimated his
                    political skills. I think we probably viewed him as far and away the smartest of
                    all the political leaders in that area. But he was also viewed as unburdened by
                    any values that we thought were important, human rights, for example, or his
                    fomenting of distrust among various nationalities. His technique was often to
                    stand back and let others do the dirty work. For example, when Serbia announced
                    the economic boycott of Slovenia (this would be equivalent to Texas declaring an
                    economic boycott of New York) Milosevic never said a word. It was done by
                    subordinate organs in Serbia, the Chamber of Commerce, I think was the one that
                    first announced it. Milosevic would often stay in the background. That was his
                    style. Anyway, our attitude towards Milosevic was that he was a negative
                    influence, but a formidable one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About with the Albanians, if we're still looking at
                        Kosovo, did we have people we could talk to in the Albanian...I'm talking
                        about the Albanian minority. How did we treat them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Yes, we met regularly with them. Warren would go down regularly. I
                    went down initially a bit less often because Warren was traveling there on a
                    fairly regular basis, as was the political counselor. But I also went from time
                    to time and met with the leadership, especially Ibrahim Rugova who still today
                    is the acknowledged leader of the Kosovo Albanians. We kept up a regular
                    dialogue with them. Our basic message was that we supported their human rights,
                    that we encouraged them to use all legal means to try to advance those rights,
                    that we were sending the same message to the federal government, and to the
                    Serbian government. But at the same time we were strongly discouraging them from
                    acts of violence which we felt in that context could only cause suffering, and
                    not improve their lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel that the Albanians...Albania now being a
                        different type of country after the communists had left, were they too busy
                        with their own problems, or were they fishing in these waters? Or how did we
                        feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: There is a complex relationship between the Albanian government and
                    leadership, and the Kosovo leadership. Ethnic affinity is one important element
                    of the dimension that a certain mutual mistrust is also there. As I understand
                    it a lot of the leaders in Albania are somewhat nervous and a little
                    apprehensive of the Kosovo Albanians who because they lived in a more
                    sophisticated country are much more widely traveled, have more political
                    experience. The Kosovo Albanians were in effect self governing at a time when
                    the Albanians were suffering under Hoxha. Despite these differences, the
                    government in Tirana tends to call for strong steps against Serbia, and
                    advocates the rights of the Kosovo Albanians. But I think they would be very
                    nervous about an early amalgamation of the two entities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, we're talking about '89-'90, were we running
                        around looking for human rights violations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oh, sure. First of all we have to because of the annual human rights
                    report. We were always very careful not to take anybody's allegation at face
                    value. We knew that whether it was the Kosovo Albanians, the Krajina Serbs, or
                    anybody else, that there was a tendency to exaggerate. So we would always look
                    for credible objective collaborating evidence. But there was no question that
                    the Serbian policy in Kosovo, and I would say at a slightly later date, Croatian
                    policy in Krajina, stripped people of rights that they had enjoyed up until that
                    point. In other words there was a real setback in terms of ability to organize
                    politically, right of free speech, employment rights, education rights of the
                    minority in their own language, were stripped away for a time. So the human
                    rights situation was abysmal, no question about it, and that was documented in
                    great detail in the human rights reports.</p>

                <p>RACKMALES: I don't want to give the impression that Slobodan Milosevic was the
                    only Serb who questioned our heavy emphasis on the Kosovo. I think probably all
                    but the very small and uninfluential group of Belgrade intellectuals who
                    identified with western European values and who usually got about one percent of
                    the vote in Serbian elections, felt that we were obsessed with the Albanians,
                    and the issue again of a double standard came up. It was an issue that has
                    haunted us through all these crises, and if you saw today's Washington Post,
                    Tony Hall, a congressman from Ohio, has a very interesting piece in which...he's
                    one of the few, Jimmy Carter was another, who draws attention to the fact that
                    we have tended to have a double standard in the human rights area, to focus
                    almost entirely on Serbian transgressions, and to ignore, downplay, or excuse
                    similar things when they're done by others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '89 until '93, Kosovo never really
                        blew up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. There were a couple of tense moments and a few
                    fatalities. Had those happened a few years earlier it would have been more
                    dangerous. As we went from '90, which may have been the point of maximum danger,
                    as we went into '91 and '92 and '93, some might have predicted that as fighting
                    was taking place, violence was happening elsewhere, that Kosovo would have
                    gotten more dangerous. In fact, it got less dangerous. My last visit to Kosovo,
                    which I think was in April of 1993, there was less police presence, you saw
                    almost no policemen. Whereas the first time I had gone there on every block you
                    had two Serbs with machine guns walking around. And I think that's one of the
                    ironies, one of the paradoxes, of the whole series of crises in that area is
                    that the explosion of violence in Bosnia had the effect, I think, of sobering
                    the Kosovo Albanians. The other factor that I think has dampened tensions is
                    that, while in every formal respect Kosovo is still a colony in terms of the
                    formal power structure, the Serbs have tolerated a parallel Albanian structure,
                    including schools, hospitals. Basically there is a functioning, even though it
                    is illegal, Albanian government there, and the Albanian community goes about
                    most of its business, including a very thriving involvement in smuggling. You
                    see a lot of BMWs driving around, and they're not being driven by Serbs for the
                    most part. So Kosovo which we looked to as the most likely flashpoint in 1989 is
                    now maybe the least likely flashpoint as of today.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Okay. Let me organize it by using as a focal point the visit of Jim
                    Baker, Secretary of State, in June of 1991 because that was the critical period
                    from May-June '91 through probably the fall of '91, the key decisions were taken
                    by everybody that led to the explosion of violence, first in Slovenia-Croatia,
                    and then later in Bosnia. First of all, he came not just as the Secretary of
                    State of the United States. This was a period in mid-1991, and we as an embassy
                    had been working towards this, and it reflected, I think, the high degree of
                    cooperation that existed among the missions. Everybody was beginning even as
                    late as I would say mid-'90, in some cases towards the end of '90, some major
                    embassies were still pooh-poohing the idea that a breakup was imminent, or that
                    if it happened, that it couldn't be handled in a fairly peaceful way. I think we
                    were the least complacent of the embassies, but our views were pretty closely
                    shared by the major west European embassies. So when Baker scheduled his first
                    trip to Yugoslavia, it was one of the last times that we and the Europeans were
                    on the same wavelength. And the policy was to send the following signals: was
                    first of all to the Slovenes and the Croats who had announced that they were
                    about to declare their independence unilaterally, and damn the consequences of
                    that. The message was, that we would not support unilateral steps to break up
                    Yugoslavia. That they needed to try to come up with a political solution, and
                    preserve some form of Yugoslavia. If that was not viable, then they had to still
                    continue to talk until an agreed dissolution could be achieved. That was the
                    first part of the message, and that was aimed primarily at the Slovenes and the
                    Croats.</p>
                <p>The other message was addressed to the army and to the Serbs, was; you must not
                    use force to keep Yugoslavia together. I think in those two messages, there was
                    a contradiction that has bedeviled us all along and the contradiction is the
                    following:</p>
                <p>That it was not fully appreciated that except for Slovenia, all of the successor
                    states to Yugoslavia were also multi-ethnic states. Bosnia was in the worst
                    position because there was not even a majority ethnic group. So if you are let's
                    say a Serbian senior military officer what you're hearing from the west is that
                    we don't think that a multi-ethnic state should use force against a minority
                    that wants to break away and form its own state. What would go through his mind
                    is fine, if Croats want to leave Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavia constitution gives
                    them the right as Croats. What it does not do is give them the right to take
                    Serbs with them against their will. The Serbs have the same right not to be part
                    of Croatia as the Croats not to be part of Yugoslavia. The underlying question,
                    when is it justified for the international community to provide arms or other
                    support to a multi-ethnic state facing a minority insurgency, is one of the most
                    vexed of our times. But the foundations of our policy as it emerged vis-a-vis
                    Croatia and Bosnia were shakier than we liked to admit. It helps explain why so
                    many statesmen have been struggling with this. There are other aspects of it
                    obviously but it's one that has never been resolved, and that may only be
                    resolved when finally sadly, tragically, as a result of the war populations are
                    moved so that new boundaries can be drawn and everyone throws up their hands and
                    says okay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: He was very unhappy with the whole experience. I was on the bus with
                    some senior NSC staffers and their attitude, and I believe that this reflected
                    his as well, is that, first of all, the Yugoslav crisis was horribly
                    complicated. One of them called it worse than the Middle East. Secondly, there
                    were no good guys. Baker was not happy with any of his interlocutors, he thought
                    they were all to a greater or lesser extent, mostly greater, lying to him,
                    dissembling. He also felt that he had gotten some assurances from the Slovenes
                    that the Slovenes later said was just a misunderstanding on his part. So when
                    the Slovenes a few days later went ahead and announced their independence, he
                    felt personally betrayed. At that point he was probably more angry with the
                    Slovenes than any others. But his basic judgment (which I remember thinking at
                    that time, and still do think was correct), was that, boy, if the Europeans want
                    to take this one on, let them. He saw nothing good to be gained by the United
                    States trying to play the lead role in finding a way out of that maze. And the
                    Europeans at that point were trying to forge a common foreign policy. This was a
                    period of some optimism that a more united Europe could be...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's exactly right. I don't want to get bogged down in the details
                    of how the European Community went astray. Although I agreed that we should let
                    the Europeans take the lead, I didn't think we should withdraw completely from
                    the fray. I thought we should help the EC if they came to have problems. We
                    should be quietly supportive. But that unfortunately we didn't do, or we didn't
                    do very effectively because there was an important conference in Ochrid within a
                    month or six weeks of Baker's visit. It was kind of the first really acid test
                    for the Europeans, and they had hammered out a political agreement which five of
                    the six leaders had agreed to. The holdout was Tudjman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: And I remember trying to get the State Department to weigh in heavily
                    in support of the European position, and bilaterally with the Croats to warn
                    them that they should not walk out. And I got a wishy-washy response saying,
                    well, we think the important thing is to stop Milosevic, and we think Tudjman's
                    concerns may be justified, we don't see any reason to weigh in.And Tudjman
                    walked out of the meeting, the meeting broke up, and the fighting spread
                    dramatically within the weeks after that.</p>

                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I happened to be at the time of that particular conference because,
                    although Warren was still ambassador, he was away at that time. I did not become
                    the permanent Charge until May of 1992.</p>
                <p>Let me just wrap this segment up by saying one word about our coordination, or
                    lack thereof with our European friends. I mean the hostility, the backbiting
                    that erupted between the Germans and the other Europeans over the issue of
                    recognition of Slovenia and Croatia was very damaging to the European Community.
                    I felt that one of our greatest risks was of allowing this to do the same
                    between us and the Europeans. We haven't avoided that entirely, particularly
                    when Clinton was forced to unilaterally announce that we would not observe, or
                    monitor, the arms embargo, when we unilaterally withdrew our ships. I thought
                    that was terribly misguided. activity. Anyway, we seem at the moment to be back
                    in a bit more cooperative relation with the Europeans but throughout this we've
                    been dogged by the fact that, I guess for political reasons, we feel the
                    necessity to criticize the activity of allies who are carrying out United
                    Nations' mandates that we in many cases pressed, as far as I know, nothing
                    that's happening on the part of any of the UN agencies in Bosnia is happening
                    against, or in contradiction to the series of United Nations security council
                    resolutions. All of which we either drafted or played an important hand in
                    shaping. It's unfortunate, I think, that we have sometimes taken the easy way
                    out, and tried to point the finger at allies who are taking a disproportionate
                    share in Bosnia of casualties and expense and risk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Larry Eagleburger? He was number two in the State

                        probably was our most experienced hand in Yugoslavia, and here he was
                        sitting right underneath Jim Baker. What was your impression, and maybe of
                        the embassy, of Eagleburger's role at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Eagleburger came to Belgrade in 1990. It was the only time in the four
                    years that I was there he came. His personal conclusion at that time was that
                    Yugoslavia was finished, and he anticipated the embassy on that one. I think all
                    of us knew that there was certainly a good possibility, a probability, that it
                    would be. But all of us were also concerned about the policy consequences of
                    acting as if it was hopeless, and there was nothing we could do. In other words,
                    even if there were only a 10% chance of keeping it together it was so important
                    because the consequences of a disintegration were so serious that we had to
                    still act as if, and to take whatever steps were possible in order to try
                    increase that 10% chance, which was the policy line that we continued basically
                    up through the Baker visit. But I think Eagleburger concluded a year and a half
                    before the visit took place that say what you like, the place is going to fall
                    apart, which was also the conclusion of the National Intelligence Estimate that
                    got leaked to the press, which again had the effect of helping the
                    self-fulfilling prophesy. If you give up on a country, then its prospect of
                    surviving is further reduced. I give credit to Eagleburger, even though he
                    himself was somewhat apologetic when I called on him on one of his last days in
                    office, when he was Secretary of State. He said something like, “I'm sorry we
                    haven't provided you much policy support.” Eagleburger has taken a lot of heat
                    for this, but I happen to think he was right in characterizing what was going on
                    in Bosnia as a civil war. The popular view is that it's simply Serbian
                    aggression, and this is a fault line that divides many of the commentators, and
                    the people who are strong advocates of military action to stop Serbian
                    aggression, and people who view the conflict as more of a civil war in which we
                    should not take sides. And that is a fault line that is still very much there.
                    Sometimes people move from one side to the other. George Kenney who was the
                    first to resign from the State Department if you remember back in '93, on the
                    grounds that our policy was immoral because we did not use force, and were
                    condoning aggression, etc. He has now crossed to the other side. There's no
                    organization, no government agency that is not divided within itself between
                    proponents of those two basic points of view. I watched a few months ago on
                    C-span a debate over Bosnia at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
                    tank. All four of the debaters were conservative foreign policy
                    specialists—Jeane Kirkpatrick, Patrick Glenn, and two others. You had the same
                    basic division, this same inability to come to an agreed framework of analysis.
                    The debate has often been highly emotional, and usually there's a lot more heat
                    than light thrown on the issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to the Slovenia and Croatia. Let's say when you
                        arrived in '89, what was the view of Tudjman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: Tudjman wasn't really on the scene very much in '89. He had been
                    living in semi-seclusion in a think tank. He had left the communist party and
                    become an anti-communist. It was only in the run-up to the election when he
                    formed a party that made an overt appeal to Croatian nationalism, that made no
                    attempt whatsoever to appeal to Serbian voters. Their platform and their party
                    activities would have alienated and antagonized even the most moderate Serbs.
                    They basically ran against the former communist party which had become even more
                    liberal, had shed its communist ideology and re-named itself, and other small
                    mainly multi-ethnic parties. And of course there was the Serbian nationalist
                    party which was kind of a Serbian counterpart to Tudjman's party which obviously
                    won overwhelmingly down in the Krajina. A lot of the urban Serbs who lived in
                    Zagreb voted more for the ex-communist party or for some of the new parties
                    which tried to model themselves on west European parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This election was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Croatian election would have been April of '90, and the same
                    pattern emerged that we saw even more strongly in Bosnia later that year, and
                    which was very ominous, namely that when you introduced democracy and
                    multi-party systems, you were fragmenting society on ethnic lines. You had a
                    polarization around the parties that appealed to one ethnic group, and that was
                    certainly true of the HDZ, and it was certainly true of the Serbian party that
                    ran in the Krajina. And in Bosnia, where of course Izetbegovic and his people
                    have to support a multi-ethnic Bosnia, but that was not the campaign they ran in
                    1990. Their party was actually in ferment allied with Karadzic's party. Oddly
                    enough people forget that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Karadzic being the Serbian, the Bosnia-Serbian leader.
                        They are certainly enemies at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. All three of the ethnically based parties in the Bosnian
                    elections ran, if not exactly joint campaigns, that agreed among themselves,
                    listen, we won't attack each other, what we will attack are these multi-ethnic
                    parties because Markovic, the federal prime minister, had encouraged the growth,
                    and even announced something called an alliance of reformed forces that he hoped
                    would galvanize western oriented economic reform based on political parties. So
                    he was working in Bosnia with intellectuals and others who shared those values.
                    Well, all of those parties did miserably. They were attacked by the nationalist
                    parties who did not attack each other. So it's one of the many tragedies and
                    ironies of this whole situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to a certain extent it helps justify the feeling that
                        they asked for it, and let's not get into the middle of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right. It raises again this issue that I mentioned of the
                    double standard. When Jimmy Carter went last year in a rather forlorn, and I
                    think misguided effort to try to bring about a more stable peace, if you
                    remember he met with all the parties, and he made one public statement for which
                    he was roundly criticized, namely that he thinks the Serbian position is not
                    widely understood. But he's right. The Serbian position has...and I'm obviously
                    not talking about Serbian atrocities but the political basis for the Serbian
                    argument which was that the Bosnian constitution, which stated at that point
                    that no important decisions could be taken except by consensus among the three
                    national groups. That principle has now been reinstated in the Dayton accords.
                    It's because of Bosnia's unique status where there is no majority group. That
                    was the one thing that set Bosnia off from all the others. All of them except
                    Slovenia were multi-ethnic, but in all of them except Bosnia there was one group
                    that had 60% or more of the population. In Bosnia the Muslims had about 43, the
                    Serbs had about 34 roughly, and the Croats had the rest. The Bosnian
                    constitution had said that no major national decisions can be taken except by a
                    consensus of the three groups. So when the Serbs said, hey, wait a minute, what
                    is more important than a decision to leave one country and declare independence.
                    And it kind of got brushed aside by the international community. But their
                    argument deserves more consideration, I think, than its gotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to your time, and your experience.
                        Tudjman wins this election in Croatia, how were relations? We have this
                        thing where Milosevic basically has cut us off. How about when Tudjman came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, relations were strained with Tudjman too because what
                    immediately happened is that...and he had some very unsavory characters coming
                    in, he brought some people back from the United States with World War II
                    backgrounds...</p>
                <p>One of the first things they did was to in effect fire all of the Serbian police
                    down in the Krajina. At the same time there was widespread firings in factories
                    of Serbian managers. A whole series of steps that caused us to focus on Krajina
                    in the human rights report. To Warren's credit he would confront Tudjman with
                    these. Although Tudjman would always see Warren, Tudjman knew very well that his
                    only chance of achieving independence was with a degree of western sympathy. So
                    he would never have stiff-armed the United States the way Milosevic did.
                    Nevertheless, Tudjman put into the Croatian press some extremely nasty
                    criticisms of Warren for his criticisms of Croatian human rights issues. So we
                    were not beloved by either of the two major protagonists because we called the
                    human rights situations as we saw them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Slovenia? Slovenia has sort of passed over
                        our radar so much that one doesn't think about it anymore. How did we see
                        that situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: The Slovenes were always the easiest to talk to. We, of course, knew
                    that they did not have the kinds of internal problems because they were a
                    homogeneous society. We tried to encourage them with very limited success to
                    stay involved. We also supported Baker's message that a unilateral declaration
                    of independence would set off the Croats but the Slovenes basically didn't give
                    a damn about the Croats or anything else. They wanted out, they didn't care
                    particularly what the consequences would be, and they wanted to simply go their
                    own way, and the less they heard about the subject of Yugoslavia the better. So
                    basically they would listen politely, and then shrug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the intra-embassy situation in Belgrade during
                        this time? Did you begin to sense differing views. Particularly I'm thinking
                        of the Germans more than anyone else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: No, the Germans were arguing basically the same things we were. The
                    problem is that their government was not paying much attention, they were in
                    fact going their own way to the great distress of the German embassy. Its been
                    reported now widely that not only the German embassy in Belgrade, but the German
                    foreign ministry at the most senior professional levels tried desperately to get
                    Genscher and Kohl off of their premature recognition kick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this happened what was the analysis from our embassy
                        when Germany made...when was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I talked to Vance about the German push for early recognition. He knew
                    Genscher pretty well, and he said I don't know why he's doing this. I can't talk
                    to him about it; he's totally closed off. Vance was deeply distressed when the
                    Germans and other Europeans announced their plans to recognize Slovenia and
                    Croatia, and then was even more distressed, and Warren and I were the ones who
                    actually broke the news to him, that the United States and the Europeans were
                    going to recognize Bosnia. He literally turned pale, and shook his head and
                    said, there's going to be terrible tragedy as the result of this. He had argued
                    as forcefully as he could against recognition because it undercut his role as a
                    negotiator because recognition was the one thing that...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Recognition of Croatia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: That's right, Slovenia and Croatia. It was the strongest lever that
                    the west had to help try bring about a peaceful solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering with the German recognition of Croatia,
                        particularly of Croatia...I'd come from Yugoslavia in an early era and had
                        not had to deal with the problems you had, but one is certainly aware of the
                        unholy alliance between Nazi Germany and Croatia during the war that every
                        Serb remembers, that was mother's milk, and no matter what the other
                        problems were, this one must have set off every nerve jangling, didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Oh, absolutely. Many Americans would make fun of what seemed to us
                    exaggerated Serbian fears of Germany, and yet I believe the Serbs were not just
                    blowing smoke. Although their fears in an objective sense were exaggerated,
                    popular feeling was genuine. Also, the credibility of the European community was
                    shattered. The European community was getting whiplashed between Germany in the
                    north who had their own policy toward Croatia and Slovenia and were not about to
                    go with the consensus that the British and French were trying to build and the
                    Greeks in the south, who had special interests in Macedonia. The Greeks were
                    able to block any sensible policy not only on the part of the European
                    community, but on the part of the United States which is hampered by the clout
                    of the Greek lobby and the Greek members of Congress.</p>
                <p>In 1991 the European community gave to a group of wisemen called the Badinter
                    Commission, now mostly forgotten, the task of setting guidelines for what
                    criteria should be used on which to base decisions to recognize successor states
                    to the former Yugoslavia. I think they did an excellent job. Under their
                    criteria Slovenia easily met the criteria. No big human rights problems,
                    overwhelming consensus on the part of the population. They gave a kind of green
                    light. The next state which came close to meeting the criteria was Macedonia.
                    Macedonia because the two major communities, the Macedonians and the Albanians,
                    were both involved in the parliament. The Albanians took part in political life,
                    and both groups basically supported independence. The Albanians had some
                    grievances but these are being addressed to a greater or lesser extent. So
                    Macedonia would have been the next country. Well Macedonia is still unrecognized
                    because of Greek objections over the name which helps destabilize that area.</p>
                <p>Croatia did not meet the recognition criteria because of what the commission felt
                    were serious human rights concerns, and the fact that a major component of the
                    population, the Serbian minority, had justified fears of their equality within
                    the state. The Croatian constitution was the only one that explicitly said, this
                    is a country of the Croatian people, and there are also some other nationalities
                    who live here as well. It's not very reassuring if you're a Serb.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>And then Bosnia was at the very bottom of the Commission's list because of the
                    lack of even a true majority consensus. The vote that was held after the EC
                    asked the Bosnians to hold a plebiscite on independence was in some ways a farce
                    because the Serbs boycotted and the and the Croats voted for it, but not because
                    they genuinely supported a multi-ethnic country. They quickly went as far as the
                    Serbs did, and created their own separate mini-state which flew the Croatian
                    flag, and used Croatian currency. But tactically Tudjman knew that in order to
                    get western support he had to appear to support a multi-ethnic Bosnia. So he
                    told his people, you will vote for an independent Bosnia, and then afterwards
                    we'll take care of you. It was kind of a farce, the plebiscite, and again that
                    was at the root of many of the problems we're facing today.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that Vance was arguing very strongly against recognition of Bosnia,
                    and I think a number of the European countries had misgivings about it, but the
                    debate did not focus on the issues that the commission raised. What the debate
                    focused on was: how can we dissuade Serbs from in effect unilaterally seizing
                    Bosnian territory. So the decision was based on the idea that the Serbs would be
                    dissuaded because of fear of international reactions. So the act of recognition
                    was really one of a series of disguised threats of force, or if you will,
                    bluffs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: No, I have to say that it was also the view that the embassy by and
                    large was also putting forth. I was not there for all of that debate because I
                    was on home leave for a key segment of that. But my recollection is that we
                    were, and Warren and most of the embassy staff, felt the way that I've just
                    described, namely, that there would be more chance the Bosnian Serbs would
                    refrain from violence if Bosnia were recognized.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking really you might say the policy; working

                <p>RACKMALES: We had a full range of policy differences. We had the people who
                    wanted the United States to get involved with at least air power against the
                    Serbs, not many proponents of sending U.S. troops, never have been as far as I
                    could see. But we had people who wanted the Air Force to start bombing. But
                    other Embassy officers were strongly opposed to any U.S. military involvement,
                    thinking that all it would do would be to expand the fighting, cause more death
                    and misery, and still not result in a viable multi-ethnic state. So, we had the
                    full range. One of the achievements that I am particularly proud of is that
                    despite all this, which would come out in our discussions in country team
                    meetings, we continued to function as a team very effectively. We did not, I
                    think, let our policy prejudices or preferences, however you want to
                    characterize it, affect our reporting which I think was outstanding for
                    objectivity, and Washington told us that we were far and away the most objective
                    in reporting on the situation. I don't think anyone whether they belong in camp
                    A, camp B, or somewhere in between, was particularly happy with the way U.S.
                    positions were unfolding. What we were often doing was talking as if we were
                    going to do something that would make camp A happy, and then in fact behaving as
                    if we were really in camp B, so people were always off balance. I remember going
                    back to Washington at a time early in the Clinton administration when the people
                    in camp A, the proponents of bombing the Serbs now, were saying, now it's going
                    to happen because of what Clinton said in the campaign. He's strongly committed
                    to this. Some of the new administration's pronouncements about lift and strike
                    tended to reinforce that. A message that they sent to Milosevic reinforcing one
                    that Bush had sent that sounded very bellicose, almost like the kind of
                    ultimatum you send when you're really about to take action. I remember when I
                    went back to Washington in spring, 1993 and camp A was saying: they're going to
                    be evacuating us, and we're really going to hit the Serbs. I was skeptical and
                    as a result of my consultations in Washington it became clear to me that we were
                    no closer to a decision of that kind than we had been in the final months of the
                    Bush administration. So I came back and shared my impressions with my
                    colleagues, and there were some very disappointed people on the staff and others
                    who were relieved.</p>
                <p>Let me just make one brief point about professionalism if I may because I think
                    it's appropriate. I was one who was unhappy with the American Foreign Service
                    Association. For a period of several months around the time of the resignations,
                    George Kenney, Marshall Harris...</p>

                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: I have nothing against George Kenney, nothing against Marshall Harris.
                    I think the crisis is one on which even professionals can have very different
                    policy views, and I also respect someone who feels that the morality of the
                    situation is so clear cut and one sided that they can't in any way be associated
                    with a government or an organization, or the State Department, that pursues an
                    immoral policy. That is their right, and I respect them for that. What I did not
                    like was the editorial line, and the whole treatment of this issue by the
                    American Foreign Service Association. Tex Harris wrote an editorial in the
                    Foreign Service Journal saying that these resignations represent the highest
                    form of professionalism. That I don't agree with because it implies that it was
                    less professional not to have held the policy preferences that these people had.
                    I know that there are people who felt just as strongly as Marshall Harris, who
                    continued to work on at great psychological costs to themselves, but worked on
                    very professionally. That to my mind is the height of professionalism. I don't
                    mean that as a criticism of Marshall, but the Association's standpoint was
                    implicitly a criticism of the people who did not meet this highest standard of
                    professionalism. There was a kind of... glorification is too strong, but
                    certainly a feeling that the State Department should take a special pride that
                    we have people who leave because their policy is not being followed. So I wanted
                    to just get my own view on the record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you on this. In the first place, Pope John
                        Paul II made an announcement, and again being outside I shuddered when I
                        heard this about supporting Croatia because if the Germans were particularly
                        bad over Serbia, the Catholic church was almost as bad during World War II,
                        the equivalent of pogroms, or whatever you want to call them against Serbs.
                        How did that hit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Well, I think you characterized it correctly. I think it was very
                    short sighted to turn the crisis into implicitly a religious struggle in which
                    you side with one of the parties who happens to share your religion. There were
                    many contradictions and ironies. The Catholic bishop of Sarajevo was a proponent
                    of ethnic cooperation in Bosnia and was working to promote reconciliation.
                    Unfortunately, he was living under a severe death threat in Sarajevo and
                    couldn't even leave his residence. Who do you think was threatening him?
                    Nationalist Croats. Croats whose views were like those of the Archbishop of
                    Mostar, whom I had called on at the time of the Bosnian elections. I never met a
                    more nationalistic Croat than the Archbishop of Mostar. He bragged about the
                    fact that 98% of his flock were members of Tudjman's party. He was a fire and
                    brimstone nationalist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Croatia declares independence. Slovenia declares
                        independence. Macedonia declares independence. We recognized these...not
                        Macedonia. What happened to the embassy because this was the embassy to
                        Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: In the case of Slovenia and Croatia, once the fighting had started, it
                    became very difficult for us to keep in close touch. Even though Croatia did not
                    become an embassy for a number of months, our oversight of them became a
                    formality, and an administrative fact rather than a political fact because they
                    became a de facto embassy and were getting some of their guidance directly from
                    Washington, although we were always kept in the picture and could comment. And
                    then, of course, with recognition our role ended entirely. We would continue to
                    give a bit of administrative support because it was a very small embassy and
                    needed help. But even that quickly shifted to Vienna and Budapest because of the
                    practical problem, you just couldn't get from here to there.</p>
                <p>On the other hand with regard to the other republics, with regard to Macedonia we
                    had not set up any kind of an office there until almost a year after I left. So
                    we were still fully responsible for contacts with Macedonia. In fact I traveled
                    down on average every six to eight weeks, and met with Gligorov. Within three or
                    four months of my becoming Charge, we got an extra person to actually live down
                    there in a hotel in Skopje, and report through us. He would either FAX or come
                    up from time to time and write reports. He was an outstanding officer, and that
                    was very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Warren leave, and how did he leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: He left in May of 1992. He left within a day or two of the European
                    ambassadors. This was another example of the frequent breakdown in communication
                    and coordination between the Europeans and ourselves. Neither the resident
                    ambassadors of the European Community in Belgrade, nor the United States
                    Government knew, although there had been vague rumors, that in fact at a meeting
                    of European Community foreign ministers, the issue was being discussed of
                    withdrawing EC ambassadors. So the first that anyone learned of this was when
                    Genscher left the meeting which was still going on and announced to the world
                    that the European community was withdrawing ambassadors from Belgrade. I heard
                    that Jim Baker picked up the phone and gave Genscher hell for the lack of
                    consultation. Maybe Genscher's defense was that the EC ambassadors had not been
                    told either. Even though Baker was angry, he realized that there was no way that
                    we could keep an ambassador there once the Europeans had withdrawn theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What precipitated this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: The fighting in Bosnia had begun, and the situation was rapidly
                    getting worse. There was no sign of any Serbian responsiveness to the concerns
                    of the international community, and also of course at that point Serbia was not
                    recognized. The Ambassadors were not accredited to any recognized entity.
                    Primarily it was done as a sop to public opinion, which was outraged over the
                    carnage that was occurring, and demanding some response.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal during this time as Charge, which is
                        really a very long time, with the Serbian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: From June to December, 1992 the person who headed the Serbian
                    government, the prime minister, was a Serbian-American businessman, Milan Panic.
                    Panic had been brought in by Milosevic. Despite that, he told Eagleburger that
                    his plan was to get rid of Milosevic. In other words, he was going to turn
                    Serbia around from an authoritarian communist state, to a western oriented
                    democratic friend of the United States. I was quite skeptical about his chances
                    of accomplishing anything. I was also very nervous about having a United States
                    citizen as prime minister. I was worried about freedom of information, what
                    could I say about him in cables that he and his lawyers could access, so I
                    tended to report in a very back channel way at first. Later on I got some
                    reassurances, and I put more into the front channel, although it was always with
                    a limited distribution. I did see Panic regularly. I don't think he ever had any
                    chance, even if he had been politically more savvy than he was, of unseating
                    Milosevic. Milosevic is an extremely astute operator. He would not make such a
                    dumb mistake as to bring someone all the way from the United States who is going
                    to threaten him in any way. It was naive of Panic to think it could be
                    otherwise. Any small chance that he theoretically might have had were undercut
                    by his complete ignorance of the Serbian scene. He didn't know the players or
                    even speak the language very well. He relied on a few advisers, including a
                    former FSO, Jack Scanlan. Jack had been ambassador before Warren, and was
                    working for Panic in a dual capacity. One was a business capacity as Eastern
                    European representative for Panic's chemical corporation. The other was as a
                    foreign policy and political adviser. Unfortunately, even though Panic certainly
                    needed advice, he didn't always listen but when he did the advice he got was not
                    always sound. One of the worst mistakes he made was to try to cozy up to one or
                    two of the senior military people who I guess he and Jack felt might help swing
                    the Army around to his side. And it ended up in a humiliation for Panic because
                    the primary person whom they were targeting was playing a double game. So when
                    Panic, shortly before the Serbian elections in December, nominated his supposed
                    buddy to be Minister of Defense, the guy responds by issuing a press release
                    saying no self-respecting Serb would ever work for Panic. That shows what a
                    mismatch the Milosevic-Panic contest was.</p>
                <p>Despite Panic's poor prospects we closely followed the Serbian elections, because
                    if there was any chance of bringing in a more western oriented Serbian
                    government, we couldn't ignore that possibility. And at the same time at that
                    point UNHCR was operating in Bosnia out of Belgrade. The CSCE had monitors set
                    up. We were involved in extremely intense multilateral contacts with UN
                    agencies, with the CSCE, with our European colleagues trying to deal with the
                    humanitarian crises. It was around the turn of the year, or early the following
                    year, when we started getting the U.S. relief flights dropping supplies in
                    eastern Bosnia.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Coming back to our role in Bosnia vis-a-vis Zagreb's, more and more as we went
                    into 1993 organizations like UNPF, which had been headquartered in Belgrade
                    moved their headquarters...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is United Nations Protection Force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: It was headquartered in Belgrade during the period I would say roughly
                    from June-July '92 until sometime in the early spring of '93. I spent a lot of
                    time with the UNPF commander and his chief civilian deputy who were excellent
                    sources. Most of the organizations that were actually in Bosnia, since we didn't
                    have any official Americans except for a few communicators with UNPF units
                    there, we were relying on UNPF, UNHCR, for reporting on Bosnia and we did a lot
                    of that. Gradually, some of these shifted their operations up to Zagreb, so that
                    put more of a burden on Zagreb. So basically there was an overlapping of
                    responsibility until we actually set up the embassy there. Then I heard, this
                    was after I'd left, but I heard that there were still some conflicts between
                    Zagreb and the embassy in Sarajevo as to who was going to do what.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that precipitated resignations and
                        tremendous emotion in the United States and all of western Europe were
                        atrocities. Being in an area where the government with which you were
                        working is involved, at least was seen to be involved in really horrible
                        atrocities against others. How did you deal with this in these reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: By trying to report as fully as we could, as accurately as we could,
                    as credibly as we could, not taking every initial account of an atrocity at face
                    value. There is a long tradition in that part of the world to use claims of
                    massive abuses, atrocities, etc. as a political weapon. It's a difficult subject
                    to discuss calmly and objectively because by its very nature an atrocity seems
                    to call for strong emotional response. That came up with regard to the first of
                    the mortars that fell in the Sarajevo market in '93. In the western media, of
                    course, there was no initial doubt expressed that this was a Serbian atrocity.
                    When the Serbs denied that it was their shell and accused the Bosnian government
                    of shelling their own people, I would say that 99% in the west said this is
                    absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Here are these poor victims and now you're
                    accusing them of murdering their own people. On the other hand, the UN personnel
                    in Sarajevo who investigated the incident were highly suspicious of the Bosnian
                    government, as David Binder pointed out in an excellent Foreign Policy magazine
                    article, using the cynical (but not always wrong) Italian yardstick of “who
                    benefits from this action.” The results are straightforward. The Serbian side
                    doesn't benefit, they get bombed and the international community comes down on
                    them, while the Bosnian government gets more support, including military
                    support. What worries me the most is that these atrocities, whoever is causing
                    them, tend to drive policy. For example, the Bosnian government called for
                    Holbrooke not to come to Sarajevo, to stop the peace process, because of an
                    atrocity. That is comparable to Israelis and the Palestinians not talking to
                    each other because of bus bombings, which are also atrocities. Often atrocities
                    are carried out in order to disrupt peace process. Both the media and the
                    administration would often apply a double standard perhaps because there were
                    many more Serb atrocities which came earlier in the Bosnian conflict. Our
                    Embassy for example, strongly complained following a Washington Post front page
                    story reporting that Croat forces had come in and massacred several hundred
                    Muslims in a town in central Bosnia. In contrast to the usual reaction to
                    reported Serb misdeeds, the Department spokesman failed to condemn the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the time you were in Belgrade, did you
                        feel this was not an even handed way of doing it? You're nodding your head.
                        You know the Croatians in the United States has always had a much stronger
                        political lobby. For one thing they're allied in the Catholic church, and
                        both of us know going back to the old days in Yugoslavia they can get things
                        really cranked up in Chicago and Indiana and other places where there is a
                        large Croatian Catholic community. And the Catholic church would side with
                        the Croatians, even some of the nastier things that happened during World
                        War II. Did you feel this was a factor, or was it just that we had thrown
                        our lot with the Croatians and we didn't want to get into a plague on both
                        your houses. How did you feel?</hi>

                <p>RACKMALES: I don't think the lobby was a primary influence. The lobby was there,
                    and I mentioned for example that someone like Senator Dole I think was
                    influenced by having someone who was a key member of the Croatian lobby on his
                    staff. But I think the main thing was the perception which the media fostered
                    because they were mainly seeing the war from the side of the people sitting in
                    Sarajevo. I think they bonded emotionally with them, understandably. I might too
                    if I were there, although it is interesting that many western military in
                    Sarajevo had an opposite reaction. Early on people became convinced that the
                    Serbs were the sole villains, that this is a white hat-black hat sort of a
                    thing, that they precipitated this in order to form a greater Serbia, that they
                    conquered territory that belongs to others, that they are a ruthless people with
                    no respect for human life. I'm not sure that I fully understand the reasons why
                    the public reaction to the shelling of Sarajevo was so much stronger than the
                    Russian shelling of Grozny, which was ten times more intense, that caused many
                    times more casualties, mainly elderly ethnic Russians who were being killed. It
                    was also a violation of the rules of war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has always been discriminatory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: And what the Croats did to the Serbs finally in Krajina what had been
                    done elsewhere by the Serbs people said, they had it coming to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was not ethnic cleansing, it was expulsion. You
                        left when, and whither the Balkans at that time, and also with your staff,
                        how did they feel about the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: I left in July of '93, I had been four years and frankly felt at that
                    point somewhat exhausted by the whole thing. I could see that what was driving
                    policy was not the reporting or the recommendations of the embassy. Once a
                    crisis reaches that point of political sensitivity, where the President's image
                    and domestic political considerations are concerned, that the best thing the
                    embassy could do at that point is simply to continue to report as honestly as
                    they can. And I made clear before I left to everybody in EUR that I had no
                    interest in continuing to work on that crisis. I felt after four years I needed
                    to get away from it. I really was in effect burned out at that point in terms of
                    trying to come up with new suggestions.</p>
                <p>My biggest disappointment from an institutional standpoint, is that at that point
                    our policy was in the hands of one of Clinton's worst appointees. Steve Oxman
                    was the Assistant Secretary. I think it became clear that he was so inept,
                    incompetent that he basically became an embarrassment to the administration, and
                    he was forced to leave in '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>RACKMALES: He was a lawyer. He had served in the State Department for a while
                    under Warren Christopher as some sort of special assistant, or staff assistant.
                    But his main claim to fame, I guess, that he had been either at Yale or Oxford
                    or both with the Clintons, and I think knew Hillary. The first sign that this
                    was not going to be a guy who could address these issues effectively occurred
                    when I came back to DC shortly after he had been named. I was in Washington for
                    a week, and of course put him high up on my list of people to see. I would set
                    an appointment and then he would find some reason to move it. In the meantime I
                    had seen Peter Tarnoff, I had seen people at the Under Secretary level in
                    several agencies, and I'd seen Lee Hamilton and other key people. My final
                    appointment with him was on Friday morning, my last day in DC, at 10:00 or
                    something like that. I sat in his outer office and his secretary said, I'm sure
                    he won't be long, he's got a woman in there interviewing for a job in the
                    bureau. So I waited 15 minutes, and I waited 20 minutes. In the meantime she had
                    called him twice. And the secretary at that point after about 20 minutes was
                    literally in tears, she was crying. She said, Mr. RACKMALES, I don't know what
                    to do. I had another appointment outside the building, so at that point I
                    couldn't wait any longer. I never got to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, replacing Tom
                    Niles, preceding Holbrooke. Holbrooke was brought back from Bonn. Holbrooke, to
                    his credit, and I gather from a New York Times story to his regret because he
                    has the same malaise over the issue at this point that everybody who has tried
                    to tackle it. To Holbrooke's credit he, I think, has done probably the best that
                    anybody could do given the constraints. I think that's something we all have to
                    bear in mind as Foreign Service professionals that in the last analysis it's the
                    President and what the American people will put up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RACKMALES: Thank you, Stu, I appreciated the opportunity.</p>
