                <p>HANS N. TUCH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: G. Lewis Schmidt </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 4, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Lew Schmidt interviewing Hans “Tom” Tuch at his
                        home in Bethesda, Maryland. Tom, I'm not going to go into much of a
                        preliminary. We have divided your interviews into three parts, the first
                        part of which was largely your Moscow experience, the second your VOA
                        periods, and this is the third covering the rest of your career. All of the
                        preliminaries of your background are in part one and I won't repeat them
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I think the only thing I want to do now is to ask you first whether there's
                    anything you want to say about your Moscow experience that you feel you didn't
                    say before, because the first part of it was covered almost entirely by your
                    personal experiences, and less of the actual program. Is there anything that you
                    want to say about your experience in the Soviet program before we go on to the
                    other parts of your career?</p>
                <p>Additional Discussion Of Service In Moscow: 1958-61</p>
                <p>A. The U.S.-Soviet Exchange Agreement And Its Implementation</p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, I'm not quite sure how much we covered in that interview, it's such a
                    long time ago. However, the one thing that one might just mention briefly, is
                    that in regard to the work that we did, was that we signed our first U.S.-Soviet
                    cultural agreement in January 1958. I appeared in Moscow in July '58 just when
                    the first implementation of that agreement took place.</p>
                <p>We were suddenly, and for the first time since World War II, involved in what I
                    would call a real USIS program, except that it was not called a USIS program. It
                    was called a Press and Cultural Program, because at that time at least, the
                    Soviets did not recognize USIA as an organization. I myself, in order to be
                    given a visa to work in Moscow, had to resign from USIA. I returned to State and
                    was assigned to the embassy as a State Department second secretary. However, I
                    was charged with conducting what normally a public affairs officer would do.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>For the first year I was alone trying to manage or trying to coordinate the
                    implementation of this new exchange program, which involved exchanges of
                    graduate students, pre-doctoral or post-doctoral students; second, the
                    preparation of our major American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959; third,
                    a number of performing art events, the first one of which was the tour of the
                    New York Philharmonic in the fall of 1959; and the visits of a number of
                    distinguished American composers delegations, and artists' delegation, several
                    performing artists, and a writers' delegation. I was the only officer charged
                    with these responsibilities. I had, however, the help and cooperation of a
                    number of other embassy officers, who enjoyed doing this kind of work because we
                    were the only ones who got out of the embassy. We were the only ones who were,
                    so to speak, communicating with the Soviet public, although very much
                    restricted.</p>
                <p>During that time it was determined that I needed help, that I needed another
                    officer to assist me, and I was told that I was going to get an assistant.
                    However, as things in the Foreign Service often happen, at the last moment it
                    was decided that what that new program really needed was a high ranking,
                    prestigious officer, and so a new cultural counselor was appointed, Lee Brady,
                    and I became his assistant. Which proves the old adage, “Never ask for an
                    assistant because you may be it.”</p>
                <p>At any rate, from the fall of 1959 we were then two officers, Lee Brady and
                    myself. I was the number two, and we divided up our responsibilities in that he
                    took the more intellectual exchanges, and I took the performing arts and handled
                    the press in the embassy, was the press attach�.</p>
                <p>The program was very much enlarged during those first two years, '59-'60. We had
                    a tremendous number of activities, the biggest, of course, the American National
                    Exhibition in the fall of '59. A number of other USIA officers were involved
                    with that, Jack Masey was the head of design. Actually, Abbott Washburn, the
                    Deputy Director of USIA, was coordinator in Washington of the whole thing under
                    George Allen, who was the USIA Director. George Allen came to the opening
                    accompanying Vice President Nixon.</p>
                <p>B. The Nixon-Khrushchev “Kitchen Debate” (Fall of 1959)</p>
                <p>Then, we had the big affair with Vice President Nixon and the interaction with
                    Khrushchev, the famous “Kitchen Debate,” the trip out to Siberia with the vice
                    president, and all the activities surrounding his visit. At the same time with
                    the National Exhibit, the tour of the New York Philharmonic with Leonard
                    Bernstein.</p>
                <p>C. U.S.-Soviet Relations - Ups And Downs</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Our program suddenly became very large. Many activities. Now this was during the
                    so-called “spirit of Camp David,” where there was a slow rapprochement between
                    the Soviets and us, for the first time, an easing of our relationship. That
                    continued: the Soviets also had an exhibit in New York, and there were many
                    Soviet performing arts groups, among them the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moiseyev
                    dance ensemble coming to the United States. There was a plethora of exchange
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't find that the “Kitchen Debate” put any damper
                        on that warming of relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. It just became, I would say, a symptom of that relationship in that we
                    were always at each other, but in a way that we could manage the relationship
                    much more easily than we had before.</p>
                <p>D. The U-2 Affair</p>
                <p>Now this came to an immediate and very abrupt stop on May 1, 1960, when the U-2
                    with Gary Powers was shot down, and our relations sank back into the cellar.
                    They canceled President Eisenhower's trip to the Soviet Union; Khrushchev made
                    some very antagonistic and very unfriendly statements about him and about the
                    United States, and our relationship became worse—what had previously become a
                    more normal relationship wasn't very good.</p>
                <p>However, our exchange activities continued even during this new period of
                    tension. That tension was increased because of Khrushchev's aggressive
                    statements about Berlin at that time. However, the exchanges continued under our
                    first agreement, and in 1960, after the Gary Powers incident, after the U-2
                    incident, was renegotiated in Moscow, and renewed for another two years.</p>
                <p>Now gradually the exchanges continued, the relationship moved upward again,
                    culminating in the election of President Kennedy and some movements by the
                    Soviets vis-a-vis the new president, indicating that they wanted to have better
                    relationship again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The first thing that happened after his election, the
                        day before the inauguration, was the release of two other pilots who had
                        been shot down, the RB-47 pilots who had been held prisoner by the Soviets.
                        They released them on the day after the inauguration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>E. Bay of Pigs Invasion - Relations Tumble Again</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TUCH: Again, our relationship, almost like a roller coaster, moved upward again
                    until the Bay of Pigs invasion in April '61, and then the first meeting between
                    Khrushchev and Kennedy in July 1961 in Vienna, at which Ambassador Llewellyn
                    Thompson was present. When he came back from that visit, he told us how
                    genuinely shocked President Kennedy had been at that meeting with the crudeness,
                    antagonism, and unfriendliness expressed by Chairman Khrushchev, vis-a-vis
                    Kennedy, vis-a-vis the United States. So our relationship again sank deeper. It
                    really did not revive again until after the Cuban missile incident in October
                    1962.</p>
                <p>1961-65: Service In Washington - Deputy Area DirectorFor New Soviet Union And
                    Eastern Europe Area; Later Director</p>
                <p>I left Moscow at the end of July 1961, was assigned to Washington. Ed Murrow was
                    Director of USIA, and I was assigned to a new organizational unit in USIA,
                    namely the Assistant Director of USIA for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
                    which he created. I became the deputy director of that office, Lee Brady was the
                    director. For the next four years the two of us worked very closely with and for
                    Ed Murrow, and Ed insisted that his assistant directors spend a good part of
                    their time in the area for which they were responsible. So during the next four
                    years, between 1961 and 1965, I spent quite a bit of time each year both in the
                    Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe for which we were
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>Short Return To Moscow Experiences</p>
                <p>A. Did Soviets Know of U-2 Overflights Before Shot Down?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back and ask just a couple of questions
                        about the Moscow time before we go on further with this interview. Do I
                        understand that the Soviets probably knew about the overflights of the U-2
                        or did they? They must have known or they wouldn't have been able to shoot
                        it down. Had they known for some time, as far as you can determine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, I really don't know all the facts, but we suspected that they knew
                    about the overflights, but could not do anything about them because they were
                    flying so high and they just couldn't reach them. It wasn't until the U-2 was
                    shot down, that was their first success in this. I suspect that they knew but,
                    they couldn't reach them.</p>
                <p>B. Limited Instances Of Direct Contact With Soviet Citizens</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other question I wanted to ask you, and I think in
                        your earlier interview you mentioned getting out on the streets and making
                        contact with a number of Soviet citizens and, therefore, being able to
                        report to some extent to the embassy what was going on, and what might be
                        thought by some of the locals. To what extent was that possible? Were you
                        able to contact many people, and would they talk, or was this limited to a
                        very restricted set of circumstances when you were mainly able to pick up
                        information, say, in certain instances when you went to receptions of the
                        type you just described or on train trips in the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: It was very restricted. We were very circumscribed. We were never left
                    alone without the KGB “goons,” as we called them, following us and being with us
                    at every moment of the day and night when we went out. Even when you went to
                    theater or to the opera, the ballet, they would always be with you.</p>
                <p>The only exception to that—it's not really an exception—but the only opportunity
                    that we had to talk to people at some length was on trips. That is why we tried
                    to make a lot of train trips out of Moscow. We always had to ask permission 48
                    hours in advance if we wanted to go beyond a 25-kilometer radius of Moscow. And
                    then very often, I would say at least half the time, they refused us permission
                    to go on these trips. So on a regular schedule we asked for permission to go on
                    trips, and traveled rather widely within the Soviet Union in areas which were
                    open to travel by foreign diplomats. I would say more than half of the country
                    was closed to travel by us and, in addition to that, often when we wanted to go
                    to a certain place we would be told that the area had been “temporarily closed”
                    to travel by foreign diplomats.</p>
                <p>At any rate, we did travel, and we traveled very often by train because we felt
                    that on long train trips—you know, some of them take two, three, four, five
                    days—you were in a compartment with other Soviet citizens; you were closed in
                    with them, and you really had to have contact with them, conversations, and even
                    though there may be a KGB agent on the train with you he normally was not in
                    your compartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: He was not in the compartment with you, or quite often on the train we
                    wouldn't have anybody. We would be followed to the train and then be picked up
                    again at the station where we got off. This happened frequently. So on train
                    trips, you sometimes had the possibility to have very extensive, long
                    conversations over a two-and three-day period, which would start usually, I
                    would say, on insignificant subjects. But Soviet citizens were tremendously
                    interested in anything that an American had to say to them, and they
                    immediately, when they found out you were an American, surrounded you and asked
                    you questions about your living standards, about your life, about your customs
                    and various things. Over a period of time you could also find out what they were
                    interested in.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The thing that amazed us constantly is that in spite of the, at that time, forty
                    years of vicious propaganda against Americans, that we were spies, that we were
                    trying to overthrow the Soviet Union, that in spite of this pervasive
                    anti-American propaganda, the people were very, very friendly towards us. Many
                    of them expressed this friendliness by saying, “We were allies in World War II,
                    and we must get onto the same level of a relationship again. We must be
                    friends.”</p>
                <p>The interesting thing was that the basis of this friendship goes back before
                    World War II, that many people referred to the friendliness, the cooperation of
                    the Americans back in the early 1920s when Herbert Hoover ran a food aid program
                    for the country and helped the newly established Soviet Union overcome its
                    hunger problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was true even though American troops had joined those
                        that were invading the Soviet Union in support of the White Russians at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Absolutely. It was amazing to us that this was constantly being brought up.
                    The gratitude that they felt towards Americans for saving them from
                    starvation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any cases in which they gave critiques of
                        their own country; were they criticizing at any point? Of course, I don't
                        imagine you tried to probe for that, but did they voluntarily express any
                        dissatisfactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. Usually not. What they would say, and this was, I think, a unique thing
                    in the Soviet Union at that time—unique from other countries under communist
                    rule: In the Soviet Union you still had a great number of people, mostly simple
                    people, who were convinced that communism for them was the paradise of the
                    future; that they may live in misery now and that they may not have the good
                    things in life in the way of shelter, and food, and clothing, but their children
                    will, and their grandchildren will. So they were still, were, what I would call,
                    “believers” and had a rather simplistic idea that communism was going to bring
                    them all the things that the previous hundreds of years had not brought them in
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>That was the difference I felt that whenever I left the Soviet Union and went
                    anywhere else in communist Eastern Europe, that in these other countries you had
                    no ideologically convinced communists anymore. You had members of communist
                    parties who felt that communism was giving them the good life and it was their
                    ticket to a better life, but they were not ideologically convinced. In the
                    Soviet Union at that time you still had that.</p>

                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you encounter any of the ethnic differences such as
                        have surfaced many times now, and especially recently? The reason that I ask
                        this is that in my very limited contact with people from the Soviet Union,
                        on a couple of occasions I have made the mistake of saying, “Well, our
                        Russian friend . . .” And had a Ukrainian or a Georgian say, “I am not a
                        Russian! I am Ukrainian, or Georgian!” {[Laughter} ]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Many Soviet citizens felt very proud of their ethnic heritage, especially
                    when you went down to a place like Georgia or Armenia. It was less pronounced in
                    places like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, but I'm sure it existed though it was not
                    expressed to us. In Georgia, very much so. It was very, very distinctive
                    whenever we went to the Baltics; Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. During my first
                    year, the three Baltic states were still off limits; they were opened during my
                    tour of duty there. A colleague of mine and I were the first ones to go to Riga,
                    to Latvia, and we spent three or four days there. We found a tremendous amount
                    and intensity of nationalism, nationalist pride and a great deal of antagonism
                    towards their Russian masters. In the Baltics it was very clear; it was very
                    pronounced anti-Soviet, anti-Russian. In Georgia it was less anti-Russian, but
                    very pro-Georgian nationalism. They felt that they were different. They were not
                    Russians, they were Georgians, as you just said. But at that time of course, you
                    did not have any of the ethnic manifestations which have erupted during the last
                    year.</p>
                <p>D. U.S.-Soviet Film Exchanges</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point was the motion picture exchange arrangement
                        worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: You shouldn't have asked that question. {Laughter}The first exchange
                    agreement had a provision saying that there would be a subsequent agreement on
                    the showing of American and Soviet films that would be negotiated separately.
                    Indeed, in October 1959 an American delegation came to Moscow headed by the then
                    President of the American Motion Picture Association, Eric Johnston. The deputy
                    of the American delegation was Turner Shelton who at that time was head of the
                    motion picture division in USIA. Turner Shelton was a colorful, Hollywood type.
                    One of my memories of this particular negotiation was the first morning when the
                    American delegation walked into the Minister of Culture where the Soviet
                    delegation was assembled, waiting. And the American delegation walked in and
                    Eric Johnston, Turner Shelton, several bag carriers, interpreters, secretaries,
                    behind them, all of them wearing dark sunglasses, a la Hollywood, as they walked
                    into this very dark room. The Soviets just looked at them as though this is
                    Hollywood personified. {Laughter}</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The negotiation was not a particularly good one. It did result in an agreement
                    but the agreement was not going to work very well. For one thing, the Soviets
                    were interested in having their picture shown in the United States. Their films
                    at that time just were not commercially marketable. They were terrible and they
                    just would not sell in the United States. No exhibitor wanted to show them. They
                    wanted the American Government to see to it that they were shown, but the
                    American Government has no great influence with American motion picture
                    exhibitors.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, our films, whatever film we showed, was going to be popular in
                    the Soviet Union. The last American films that had been shown in the Soviet
                    Union, I think in 1944, was “Sun Valley Serenade,” the Glenn Miller band. I
                    think Sonja Henie was in that film. The other one was a Deanna Durbin film, I
                    think it was called “A Thousand Men and a Girl,” or something like that. But
                    Deanna Durbin was the big American film star in the Soviet Union, and this is
                    1959.</p>
                <p>One of the first new American films that was to be shown in the Soviet Union was
                    “Roman Holiday” with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. I remember that without
                    telling us anything about it, they put on this film in the Olympic Sports
                    Palace. For three days they showed eight showings a day in English, without
                    subtitles and without dubbing. They filled the sports hall eight times a day, it
                    held nine thousand people, and they showed it for three days. There was never a
                    seat to be had in those showings, and they were able to use the admission fees
                    for those three days of showing to dub the film before they distributed it all
                    over the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. {Laughter}</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: At any rate, our films then were also not shown very widely and in a
                    restricted fashion because their films weren't showing in the United States and
                    we were constantly haggling over what films were to be exchanged.</p>
                <p>Messrs. Johnston and Shelton felt that the U. S. Government ought to make the
                    determination of what American films should be shown in the Soviet Union. Eric
                    Johnston had a certain amount of control and influence over the Motion Picture
                    Association of America and its members. So he could control them, but he could
                    not control those film producers who wanted to show their films independently
                    and make deals with the Soviet Union. Often those were films which were not
                    particularly complimentary to, say, our own society, which were critical of our
                    system. On the other hand the Soviets wanted to get particularly those films to
                    the Soviet Union to show, “Here are the Americans, look they themselves are
                    showing how bad things are in the United States.” So it was not a very
                    successful operation because Johnston and Turner Shelton could not control what
                    films the Soviets were going to import from the U.S. So they were finally
                    interested in not having this exchange of commercial films continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how was the agreement set up? Was there a specified
                        number of films that could be shown in any given period of time, or how was
                        it that it was possible for the U. S. side to be sure that all their films
                        were distributed rather widely, or that only films fairly complimentary to
                        America would be available in the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I don't have specific numbers, but I think it was six or eight films which
                    were going to be exchanged over the two years of the agreement. They were going
                    to be dubbed and shown widely in the Soviet Union. The first problem came about
                    when the Soviets learned they could not show their films in this country because
                    nobody wanted to show them. {Laughter}Therefore, they were reluctant to show our
                    films. At the same time, once the door was open to film exchanges, it became
                    very difficult for the American Government to tell American producers, “You
                    cannot make deals separately with the Soviet Union.” How could we restrict them?
                    We had no control over them, so the Soviets took advantage of that and started
                    dealing with independent American film makers to show films that our government
                    would have preferred not to have shown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets still count those films as part of the
                        quota that had been established?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I don't recall. The exchange became a shambles. It was never really
                    settled. Then the Soviets started having film festivals every two years in
                    Moscow and invited the United States. We participated and showed films which
                    were normally not very good films because they were the only films that the
                    State Department would agree to show. For instance, I remember the first one was
                    “Sunrise at Campobello.” That's not a very good film! {Laughter}</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yet, this was our official entry into the Soviet film festival, and we were
                    embarrassed to have that kind of a film shown, but this is what the U. S.
                    Government proposed and produced. U.S. film delegations came to these festivals,
                    and I remember the first time there was a delegation of a number of producers
                    and directors; there were no film stars, if I remember correctly. We were
                    introduced to the public before the American film was shown on the stage, and as
                    we lined up and our names were called—I was a member of the delegation that's
                    why I was on the stage. There was polite applause as our names were called, and
                    suddenly one member of our delegation whom none of us had ever really heard of
                    before—I don't recall his name right now—was introduced and a roar of applause
                    went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an actor?</hi>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>TUCH: No, he had been involved in the production of “Sun Valley Serenade” 15
                    years before, and everybody in the Soviet Union remembered him; nobody in this
                    country knew him. {Laughter}The delegation the second year included Edward G.
                    Robinson, Gary Cooper with his wife and daughter (Maria, the wife of Byron Janis
                    now) and a number of directors. This was a bigger show at that time because
                    these were known personalities. That was a good delegation because Edward G.
                    Robinson and Gary Cooper were interesting people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there subsequently a later film exchange agreement
                        worked out, or did the thing continue on the basis of the initial one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: There was never, to the best of my recollection, another formal negotiation
                    of the agreement. The film exchange was incorporated in the renegotiation of the
                    other big agreement, and it said something to the effect that our exchanges of
                    films will continue on the basis of our previous agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. I'm not going to repeat them here, but the stories
                        were legion about Turner Shelton's experience in the Soviet Union, including
                        his initial arrival at the airport and his insistence that Soviet Customs
                        officials could not examine his baggage, but that's another story.

                    And East Europe Area</p>
                <p>TUCH: We could have a tape just on that subject alone. Should I go back briefly
                    now, I think we've exhausted the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>A. Renegotiations Of U.S.-Soviet Exchange Agreement: 1962 And 1964</p>
                <p>During those four years as the area deputy director and then as the area director
                    for the Soviet Union-Eastern Europe, we renegotiated the U.S.-Soviet exchange
                    agreement. The first renegotiation took place in 1960 while I was still in
                    Moscow; the second one in 1962 in Washington, and then again in Moscow in 1964.
                    Now the State Department was still heading the negotiation process. In 1960 it
                    was Ambassador Thompson, who was head of the U.S. delegation; in 1962 it was
                    Ambassador Bohlen, and in 1964—for the moment I can't remember who it was. I was
                    no longer involved in '64, but in '62, I participated in the renegotiating of
                    the agreement under Chip Bohlen, and our program expanded greatly.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We had a number of traveling exhibits in the Soviet Union every year; exhibits
                    which the Soviets really did not want, but we made it clear, we wanted these
                    exhibits very much because it permitted us for first time to get into the
                    hinterland of the Soviet Union, to the provincial cities. Not only did we have
                    our exhibits there, but the really important element was that we had Russian
                    speaking American guides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It opened a new possibility, I gather, for talking to the
                        Soviet citizens, because you couldn't do otherwise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Absolutely. These guides were able to communicate as Americans in the
                    Russian language with Soviet citizens all over the Soviet Union. The Soviets did
                    not like the exchange of exhibits because they did not see much value in their
                    exhibits in the United States, and frankly, they didn't have much of an impact
                    here. But we thought this was a good thing for the United States and we insisted
                    on it, and we even threatened that if they would not permit us to have the
                    exhibit exchange we would curtail other exchanges which they were particularly
                    interested in, namely the exchanges in graduate students.</p>

                <p>Also, I must say that the years I spent in Washington working for Ed Murrow, were
                    for me very productive years, simply because I had the feeling that Ed Murrow
                    understood what we were trying to do in the Soviet Union and not only supported
                    it, but spearheaded it. He furthered it in every respect, getting the right
                    people to go to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>I remember on one occasion when he persuaded Danny Kaye to go to the Soviet Union
                    on behalf of USIA and do his communications job. What I'm trying to say is that
                    Ed was personally very much involved in the programming and in the efforts to
                    communicate with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>D. Ed Murrow Took Direct Hand In VOA Broadcasts To USSR</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Now, on one occasion he took a direct hand in it and that was, I think, in
                    September or October 1961, shortly after I had come back from the Soviet Union
                    when the Soviets started nuclear testing again. He was so personally incensed at
                    this that he wrote a commentary for the Voice of America himself and ordered all
                    transmitters—we were still being jammed at that time—and he ordered all
                    transmitters that were available to the Voice of America to be massed for that
                    particular commentary to be broadcast. It was a very tough commentary but he had
                    written it himself and he had broadcast it. That was an interesting phenomenon
                    because while he did this, he went to a National Security Council meeting and
                    advised the President, President Kennedy, not to take a retaliatory hard line
                    against this. In other words, he cautioned the administration to be deliberate
                    in their reply. He knew what he was doing. He himself broadcast this commentary,
                    yet he cautioned the administration to be calm and deliberate in their reply on
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that one of the bases on which we sold Ed Murrow
                        the idea and he supported it very extensively, was that he felt the present
                        administration and the European area were so involved with programming for
                        western Europe that they weren't giving an adequate amount of attention to
                        the kind of material that was going into the Soviet Union. He felt that
                        there were other approaches that could be taken but were not going to be
                        taken if we didn't have a separate organization. Consequently, I'm not
                        surprised that he involved himself so deeply in the programming and planning
                        for what went in there, because that was the main basis for setting up this
                        separate organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right. One of the things that he was interested in was what we were
                    broadcasting on the Voice of America into the Soviet Union. He was instrumental
                    at the time in changing our whole attitude and tone in our broadcast. He wanted
                    to have an American with experience in the Soviet Union, an American officer who
                    spoke Russian with recent experience to be the head of the VOA Soviet
                    division.</p>
                <p>E. Handling Alexander Barmine</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that grab Barmine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, that was the issue. Alexander Barmine—General Barmine, as he liked to
                    be called—had been the head of the Russian division of the Voice of America, I
                    think, almost ever since it started in the late '40s. He was a very hard line
                    anti-communist who had left the Soviet Union in the late '30s when he defected.
                    He had been the charg� of the Soviet Embassy in Athens and was about to be
                    purged in the Great Purge, Stalin's purge, and he defected and came to the
                    United States. He was a very conservative, I would say, almost reactionary,
                    military type who just brooked no interference with what he thought should be
                    broadcast to the Soviet Union. However, he was very well-known and highly
                    regarded on the hill, Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Yet, Ed Murrow felt that a change of direction was in order and needed to be
                    taken. So he worked out a system whereby Terry Catherman, who had succeeded me
                    in Moscow, when he came back in 1964, took over the Russian division of the
                    Voice of America. But what could be done with Alexander Barmine?</p>
                <p>So an arrangement was devised whereby Alex Barmine was “promoted” to be my
                    special assistant. I was the area director and he was to be my Soviet advisor in
                    the area. We brought him uptown and he was treated courteously; he was given a
                    nice office right next to my office and from time to time Ed Murrow greeted him
                    and talked to him briefly and made Alex Barmine feel good. He did not feel that
                    he had been demoted. I remember on one occasion when I was invited to the Soviet
                    Embassy for a reception, I said to Alex, “You've got to come along with me.
                    You're the Soviet expert in this and you come along with me, and I'll see to it
                    that you get an invitation.” They indeed sent him an invitation. He was at first
                    very reluctant to go into the Soviet Embassy, but finally agreed.</p>
                <p>We went to the Soviet Embassy and, lo and behold, he became the center of
                    attraction to all the military types, Soviet military types at the Soviet
                    Embassy who had remembered this famous General Barmine of the 1930s. He enjoyed
                    it. Then, on the way out he told me the story about his defection from his
                    embassy, the Soviet Embassy in Athens, when he walked out knowing that if he had
                    not walked out of that embassy at the moment he did, he would have been arrested
                    and possibly shot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said Barmine had been with the Voice since the late
                        '40s, actually, he had started even earlier than that. Perhaps as early as
                        the mid-'40s, I don't know just what year he defected, but I know he started
                        with the Voice when they were still in New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes, indeed, because he defected in 1938, I remember that. This was during
                    the purge. He was a prot�g� of Marshal Tukhashevskii, who was one of the
                    marshals who was purged, and when he heard that Marshal Tukhashevskii had been
                    arrested, he realized his time had come and defected to Paris.</p>
                <p>He came to the United States, I think, very soon there after. The Voice did not
                    start until 1942 and it was located in New York. I'm not sure exactly when we
                    started broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet Union. I think it was probably
                    1948, '49, but the date of that we can check with Cliff Groce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not significant, anyway.</hi>

                <p>F. Cuban Missile Crisis: Tuch In USSR Accompanying New York City Ballet</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>TUCH: At any rate, these four years in working with the Soviet Union in Eastern
                    Europe, making frequent trips there. I remember one particular trip in October
                    1962. I wanted to get back to the Soviet Union and I wanted to travel, and I
                    felt that one of the best ways that I could do that without much attention being
                    directed towards me by the KGB, was to accompany the New York City Ballet as the
                    USIA-State Department escort officer. So I went with them and we went to Moscow,
                    Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi in Georgia, and Baku the capital of Azerbaijan. We were
                    in Leningrad right in the middle of the Cuban missile crisis. It turned out
                    afterwards, I didn't know it at the time, that I was actually the only American
                    diplomat who was outside of Moscow during that time. They did not permit anybody
                    else to leave Moscow, but I was with the ballet and they didn't stop me.</p>
                <p>I was in Leningrad during the worst part of the missile crisis, being, however,
                    absolutely oblivious of what was going on. I didn't know anything until the
                    embassy called me, and they very circumspect asked me, “How are things going in
                    Leningrad?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Fine. Ballet's having a big success, cheers and applause every
                    night.”</p>
                <p>“What is the atmosphere like?” I was asked.</p>
                <p>“Oh, it's fine, great, we had no problems.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Have you been listening to the Voice of America? Have you been
                    listening to the radio?”</p>
                <p>I had a radio with me and I said, “No, I haven't been listening. The batteries
                    are dead and I haven't really been able to listen to the Voice of america.
                    Besides, I've been very busy with the ballet.”</p>
                <p>They said, “You listen to the Voice of America.” So that night I made a point of
                    listening and I found out what was going on. Of course, by that time the crisis
                    was over, it had passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had any information filtered out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. No, people in Leningrad, to the best of my knowledge, were absolutely
                    unaware of what was going on. That compared to the American reaction of the
                    missile crisis—I had a letter from my wife about two weeks later, written right
                    at the worst point of the crisis, and she was obviously very concerned about me
                    and didn't know what was going to be happening to me. But I was completely
                    unaware of it, which is also one of the interesting experiences.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other things you'd like to say in this
                        retrospect on your four years with the Eastern European area, or should we
                        go on now and talk a little bit again about Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>G. Differences In Dealing With USSR And East European Nations</p>
                <p>TUCH: The interesting thing, and I think the significant thing during those four
                    years was that we ought to differentiate our relationship between the Eastern
                    European countries and the Soviet Union. We started to look at openings that we
                    could have in Eastern Europe in our program exchanges, public diplomacy program,
                    also in our VOA broadcasts. How could we differentiate and adjust our programs
                    to actual realities of the relationship and what could we accomplish?</p>
                <p>It became possible for us, for instance, to have academic exchanges with Poland,
                    other exchanges with Poland without an agreement. On the one hand, with Romania
                    and with Czechoslovakia, not with East Germany and, at that time, not with
                    Bulgaria, and with Hungry, we began having agreements. Not necessarily formal
                    agreements, but arrangements for exchanges whereby we negotiated certain
                    exchanges without having a formal agreement as we had with the Soviet Union, in
                    order to conduct programs that we felt were mutually beneficial to our efforts
                    in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>We did begin some really interesting and fruitful exchanges, exhibits, academic
                    exchanges, magazines in the Eastern European countries. Always, of course,
                    different from what we were doing in Yugoslavia because we did not feel that
                    Yugoslavia was part of that Soviet-bloc mentality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Yugoslavia under your jurisdiction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. Yugoslavia was always part of the Western European area. In my view
                    that was correct, at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, you know there was a lot of opposition among
                        the area directors to setting up the East European area. I was the one that
                        recommended it to Ed Murrow, and he supported me. I think the only other
                        person who supported me was the Latin American area, and the rest of them
                        had varying degrees from direct opposition to doubts about it. But Ed was
                        very strongly determined to set it up for a time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>TUCH: Well, Bill Cody, who was the European area director, of course, opposed it.
                    His little empire was being cut in half. If I remember correctly, so was Walter
                    Roberts, who was his deputy. But with your help, Ed felt strongly that there was
                    so much concentration of USIA's efforts vis-a-vis the communist world of Eastern
                    Europe at that time, and it was so different from what we were doing in Western
                    Europe that he insistedthat the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe should be set up
                    as a separate area directorate.</p>
                <p>Lee left in 1964 to be PAO in Paris, and then I succeeded him. By that
                    time—Freudian slip. Who was the director at that time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carl Rowan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Oh. By that time, Carl Rowan had succeeded Ed Murrow as the director. Even
                    though I was supposed to go to Warsaw as PAO, he would not let Lee Brady and me
                    both depart at the same time. So I succeeded Lee Brady for a year, and I was
                    then supposed to go to Warsaw in 1965. Dick Davies came in to succeed me as the
                    area director, but at the last moment—and this is sort of an interesting little
                    side light of the history of USIA vis-a-vis the relationship with the State
                    Department—at the last moment, about three weeks before I was scheduled to leave
                    for Warsaw, the State Department and USIA came to an agreement to exchange
                    officers at a higher level.</p>
                <p>Bulgaria As Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM): 1965-67</p>
                <p>I was asked to go to Bulgaria as DCM, deputy chief of mission, and Art Hummel was
                    assigned to Taiwan as Deputy Chief of Mission. We were the first two non-State
                    Department officers to be assigned as DCM. Of course, he went on to great things
                    after his assignment in Taiwan, became Ambassador to Burma, Pakistan and China.
                    So I went off to Bulgaria as DCM and spent two years in Sofia from 1965 to
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go more deeply into your work in Bulgaria, I'd
                        like to ask you a preliminary question. In the course of your assignment as
                        the DCM in Bulgaria did you find that in some respects you were acting like
                        a USIS officer? Were you doing anything, or did you do anything in that
                        occasion which you might very well have done had you been the PAO in the
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: We did have a PAO, or rather a press and cultural attach� John Clayton; Tim
                    Pfeiffer in the first instance succeeded by John Clayton. But being really
                    essentially a public affairs type, I found that being a DCM, I could be a better
                    public affairs officer than I could ever have been as a public affairs officer
                    because I had the opportunity to get out and communicate, especially during my
                    two years there in Sofia. I spent almost half my tour of duty as a charg�.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Sofia was one of the last two legations in the American Foreign Service. We had
                    raised all of our missions throughout the world to embassy status with the
                    exception of Budapest and Sofia. Budapest because we had a very bad relationship
                    with the Hungarians at that time since we were “hosting” Cardinal Mindszenty. In
                    Bulgaria, we did not have a very good relationship either. Budapest and Sofia
                    were our two last legations, historically speaking, I was the last Counselor of
                    Legation in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>When we raised both to embassy status—and that happened in the fall of 1966, no
                    the spring of 1967, we didn't want to do it separately; we wanted to raise
                    Budapest and Sofia at the same time. The issue with Cardinal Mindszenty didn't
                    get resolved and, therefore, neither one of the two legations was changed. In
                    the meantime, we had had a change of chiefs of mission. Nathaniel Davis, who had
                    been the American Minister in Sofia until the spring of 1966, left
                    precipitously. He was not persona non grata, but he was withdrawn by the U.S.
                    Government as a result of an automobile accident, and there was a major
                    commotion between our two governments at that time. He was finally withdrawn.
                    His successor, John McSweeney, didn't want to arrive and be a minister and then
                    be raised to Ambassador. He wanted to wait until he came as an Ambassador, so we
                    had a long interim during which time I was the charg�. Then finally he did come,
                    because there was no immediate change of status in prospect. He came as a
                    Minister and then was changed to become an Ambassador about three or four months
                    later.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the opportunities in Bulgaria for a public affairs program, whether
                    run by a PAO[Public Affairs Officer] or by the DCM, were still very limited,
                    about as limited as they were in the Soviet Union. The relationship could not be
                    established. It was somewhat easier to deal with Bulgarians than it was with the
                    Soviets, and you found people in the population, people on the street that you
                    met, easier to make contact with and easier to talk to. It was, I'd say, a
                    softer system of communism even though Todor Zhivkov was, at that time, the head
                    of the party and government and, of course, he still is today. He was not
                    expected to last that long, but he lasted longer than anyone else.</p>
                <p>1966: U.S. Participation For First Time In Plovdiv International Trade Fair; U.S.
                    Visitors Include Senator Magnuson And USIA Director Leonard Marks</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things that happened during that time was that we
                    participated for the first time with an exhibit at the Plovdiv International
                    Trade Fair in 1966, and Senator Magnuson was the American official
                    representative to come to Sofia for this exhibit. Senator Magnuson, who just
                    died last month, and his wife came—very charming people, both of them—and,
                    fortunately for me, they were accompanied by Leonard Marks, who had become the
                    Director of USIA. This was his first trip to the Soviet Bloc. I had not met him
                    before, but he came to Sofia actually a day ahead of the Magnusons and was very
                    helpful to me. I was charg� at the time, there was no Ambassador or minister. He
                    was helpful to me in giving me suggestions and advice on how to handle Senator
                    Magnuson; they were very good friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Leonard Marks Has Verbal Exchange With Todor Zhivkov,Government Party Chairman
                    And Head Of Government</p>
                <p>It turned out that Leonard was a very pleasant person, cooperative in every
                    respect. I had arranged for a visit by Senator Magnuson with Todor Zhivkov, the
                    Chairman of the Party and the government. Leonard said to me, “Tom, you are in
                    charge here, you decide who should accompany Senator Magnuson. Of course you are
                    going, but you decide who should go and I will abide by your decision.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Of course, Leonard, you've got to come along. You should come along,
                    too.”</p>
                <p>Leonard said, “But I will not say a word during the conversation, I'll just be
                    there and it'll be very interesting to attend; but I won't say anything.”</p>
                <p>Well, I knew Leonard Marks by that time and I didn't think that this was going to
                    be the way he announced it. And sure enough we had been with Zhivkov about three
                    minutes whereupon Leonard Marks interrupted and said, “Mr. Chairman, there's
                    only one thing that I really would like to ask you. Why do you still jam the
                    Voice of America? You are the only country in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
                    Union that still jams the Voice of America.” At that time, I should interject,
                    the Soviet Union had stopped jamming. After the signing of the partial nuclear
                    test ban treaty, they stopped jamming the Voice of America and did not commence
                    again until August 1968 during the invasion of Czechoslovakia. And all the other
                    Eastern European countries had also stopped jamming the Voice of America, with
                    one exception, Bulgaria. This was sort of a significant element of our
                    relationship, they still jammed us.</p>
                <p>So here was Leonard Marks asking Zhivkov, “Why do you still jam the Voice of
                    America?” Zhivkov, who was not known to be very fast on the draw, outdid himself
                    on this occasion. He said, “Mr. Director, I could stop jamming the Voice of
                    America just like that,” he snapped his finger, “But if I did that, what would
                    you and I then have to talk about?” For once, Leonard Marks was speechless.</p>
                <p>And then he continued. He said, “You know, Mr. Director, I will stop jamming the
                    Voice of America if you'll do one thing for me.”</p>
                <p>Leonard Marks asked him, “What is that?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “If you give us most-favored-nation treatment so that we can trade
                    with you on an equal basis. End of conversation. {Laughter}</p>
                <p>The relationship with Bulgaria was a tough one, but as I said earlier, it was for
                    me, having spent three years in the Soviet Union, a somewhat easier system with
                    which to deal than in Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Of course, the climate is better than the Soviet Union. It's a small country,
                    it's a beautiful country when one travels around Bulgaria. Rugged mountains and
                    the sea shore and you have a decent climate, so the atmosphere and the whole
                    ambience in Bulgaria was somewhat different. For most of my colleagues, however,
                    it was a very tough post because it literally was the end of the line. Namely,
                    all airlines, if they even went to Sofia, would go to Sofia turn around and go
                    back West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you one more thing. You mentioned that you
                        did get out and around and talk to people, did you feel that because of the
                        fact that you had the title of DCM, charg�, or whatever the case might have
                        been, you were able to make contacts and open some doors that were closed to
                        you had you just been a PAO in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I think that it's true to a certain extent, especially as a charg�. I would
                    ride around the countryside in the official car with the American flag flying.
                    That alone was always an entree because Bulgarians felt friendly towards
                    Americans, and if they saw the American chief of mission's car coming down the
                    road with the American flag flying, they would literally stand beside the road
                    waving in a friendly way. That gave one a good feeling, I must admit. I mean
                    this was completely separate from our relationship with the Bulgarian Government
                    which was not particularly good at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that's about, for the moment at least, all you
                        want to say about Bulgaria. Why don't you pick it up from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assigned As PAO Berlin 1967-1970; However ImmediateDiscussion Goes Back To
                    Earlier Assignments In Germany</p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, after Bulgaria I was assigned as PAO in Berlin. I came, so to speak,
                    back into the USIA fold and into a situation with which I was more familiar.
                    Over my 35 years in the Foreign Service, I was able to spend a total of 14 years
                    in Germany on four different assignments. So I would say that the country and
                    the people that I feel most familiar with is Germany, and the German public.</p>
                <p>That, of course, has something to do with the fact that I was born in Germany. I
                    was born in Berlin and came to the United States in 1938 as a 14-year-old
                    boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had your German language stuck with you pretty well, or
                        did you have to rehabilitate your capability?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TUCH: I had to rehabilitate my capability, so to speak, because when I came to
                    the United States at the age of 14, I came to my mother's family in Kansas City
                    in the Midwest, and as a 14 year-old stuck in a family where only one uncle
                    spoke German—everybody else did not speak German, they only spoke English—I was
                    thrown into a midwestern American atmosphere and, as a 14 year old boy, I wanted
                    to learn English, I wanted to conform, and I wanted to do as everybody else did
                    and I didn't want to be different. So I tried to learn English quickly, and I
                    didn't really speak German even after my mother arrived three years later, and
                    she and I started communicating in English. I was very adamant that I will not
                    speak German, at that time.</p>
                <p>Joined Foreign Service In 1949 About Time Of Inauguration of HICOG</p>
                <p>I joined the Foreign Service in 1949 and my first assignment was in Germany. So
                    although I understood everything that was being said and I felt I spoke German,
                    my German was that of a 14 year old boy. Here I was an adult trying to
                    communicate in a sophisticated adult manner; yet, my German vocabulary was that
                    of a school boy. I didn't realize that and it was initially quite frustrating.
                    It took, I think, two or three years before I was able to catch up in my German
                    to the age at which I was communicating. I did manage after a while, but it took
                    some time.</p>
                <p>I was hired into the Foreign Service in October 1949 in Germany. At the time I
                    had been working for the Chase Bank in Stuttgart. At that particular moment,
                    U.S. Military Government was phasing out. The German Federal Republic had been
                    established, and the State Department was moving in to take over under John J.
                    McCloy, who became the U.S. High Commissioner. The State Department was taking
                    over all the jobs and facilities that had previously been handled by military
                    government and they were hiring people on the spot.</p>
                <p>The Story Of Entrance Into Amerika Hauser Program</p>
                <p>I was told it would be easy to get a job by various friends that I had made in
                    Stuttgart, friends with the American Consulate General in Stuttgart. They said,
                    “You just go up to Frankfurt and talk to a man by the name of Glen Wolfe, and he
                    will find you a job.” I went to Frankfurt, and I was immediately sent out to Bad
                    Nauheim near Frankfurt, where a Mrs. Patricia Van Delden was in charge of the
                    America House program in Germany.</p>
                <p>I didn't even know what an America House was when I was sent out to see her and
                    to be interviewed by her. Interested in making a change, I went out there cold,
                    and—this is a little anecdote—I was ushered into the office of a man by the name
                    of Max Kimental, who was introduced as Mrs. Van Delden's deputy. She couldn't
                    see me, she was busy, he would interview me. We started chatting and he received
                    a telephone call, and he interrupted our conversation and said, “Excuse me for
                    just a few moments, I have to go to a very brief conference and I will be back
                    in ten minutes. Make yourself comfortable. Here on the table are things to read,
                    whatever you want to read, make yourself at home.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I looked on the coffee table and there was a document, a paper which said, “The
                    Future of the America House Program in Germany” by Patricia Van Delden. So I
                    thought, I might as well find out what this is all about since I still didn't
                    know what an American House was. I read the document; it was about six pages.
                    Kimental came back in and said, “Let us continue our conversation. If you were
                    an America House Director, what would you do?” I just went along with the
                    document that I had just read, and he stopped me after about two minutes and
                    said, “Just a moment.” He stepped out and came back with a formidable lady,
                    Patricia Van Delden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Formidable is right. {Laughter}</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: He suggested that I start again from the beginning to tell Mrs. Van Delden
                    what I thought I should do as an America House Director. I mentally went through
                    the document, and to make a long story short, they hired me on the spot.
                    {Laughter}</p>
                <p>I was sworn in the next day together, interestingly, with Pick Littell, Wallace
                    W. Littell. I was sent to Wiesbaden as the Director of the America House there,
                    and Pic was sent to Darmstadt as the American House Director. One other person
                    who was working with Patricia Van Delden and Max Kimental in that same office at
                    the time—and this is interesting only for historical purposes—her administrative
                    officer was Irving Scarbeck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: “Doc” Scarbeck, a colleague, a friend who in 1961 became the first American
                    diplomat convicted of spying, and was sent to prison. But that is another
                    story.</p>
                <p>I was sent to Wiesbaden as the Director of the America House—and here I think it
                    would be useful just to interject a little about what the America Houses,were
                    because they were at that time unique to Germany and Japan.</p>
                <p>Nature Of Amerika Hauser Programs</p>
                <p>After the end of the war, with the military occupation, the U.S. authorities
                    established a number of what became known as America Houses, in German Amerika
                    Hauser, to serve as library cultural and information centers in various cities
                    in Germany. These cities had for the most part been destroyed—and I'm sure it
                    was the same case in Japan—and had absolutely no cultural infrastructure left.
                    These America Houses became the community centers for these cities. They helped
                    these communities reestablish a cultural infrastructure. They had a library,
                    they usually had music programs, lecture programs, children's programs, English
                    teaching facilities. They served as a very broad gauge community center. In my
                    view they did a lot to help the Germans emotionally and culturally re-establish
                    their society.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>For instance, one of the things which I think was significant, the America House
                    libraries were open shelf libraries where people could go into the library and
                    pick out their own book, check it out, read it there, or take it home. They were
                    the first such libraries that the Germans had even seen. The directors of the
                    university library and the public library in Frankfurt and Berlin were so
                    impressed with the nature of an open-shelf library that they rebuilt their
                    libraries in Frankfurt and in Berlin as open-shelf libraries. They were the
                    first such libraries in Germany which had in itself a democratizing effect for
                    the population who could go and read anything that they wanted to read, not what
                    the librarian told them they could have.</p>
                <p>At that time in 1949, '50, '51, there were over 40 such Amerika Hauser in
                    Germany, which were reduced to a more manageable number of about 25 in 1951, but
                    they were in every major city in Germany.</p>
                <p>Gradually as the Germans were able to rebuild their cultural institutions, their
                    cultural infrastructure, these Amerika Hauser converted themselves into American
                    institutions of information and culture and they became American cultural and
                    information centers. The libraries were usually reduced in size; they were
                    weeded to have only American materials in them—some in translation. Lecture and
                    exhibit programs were geared toward the United States. We were teaching English,
                    we were still having children's program. We were bringing people in as lecturers
                    and performing artists, but they were Americans for the most part, except that
                    Germans who had made a trip to the United States often appeared in the Amerika
                    Hauser as lecturers and discussants about their experiences in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>At that time, the public affairs program, the public diplomacy program in Germany
                    was huge. I remember there were American representatives in every “Kreis”, which
                    is the equivalent of county, in the areas which had previously been occupied by
                    the American Military Government. We had a total of 1200 American officers
                    involved in the public affairs program in Germany. With, if I remember
                    correctly, a budget of about $40 million a year.</p>
                <p>The first public affairs officer in Germany under U.S. High Commissioner John J.
                    McCloy was a publisher from Louisville by the name of Ralph Nicholson, who,
                    however, stayed only for a short time and was succeeded by Shepard Stone, who
                    was the first PAO in Germany. Shepard Stone had been the assistant editor of the
                    Sunday New York Times, and had some German background, was close to John J.
                    McCloy, and became the head of the U.S. Public Affairs Program in the FRG.</p>
                <p>It's interesting to compare when I was PAO in Germany in the early '80s, what my
                    facilities and resources were as compared to what his were in the early
                    '50s.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>He was succeeded by “Mickey” Boerner, Alfred Boerner, who was the second PAO. We
                    had a very large public affairs establishment in Germany, of which these 25
                    Amerika Hauser were only one part.</p>
                <p>I became the America House director, initially, in Wiesbaden, but after five
                    months was transferred to Frankfurt where I remained as America House director
                    until March 1955, five years. That was for me a very interesting and personally
                    satisfying period of time. I was a junior officer, yet I had an institution
                    which I ran with a staff of 55 people, 25 of whom were librarians. I had a
                    program director, I had a program every night of lectures, discussions, and
                    concerts. I had a huge English teaching program, a children's theater program, a
                    youth library, a quite large institution. I was always thinking that I was doing
                    for a salary what I was really doing for fun. It was a highly satisfying
                    activity because the Germans just swarmed into the Amerika Hauser.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we were discussing not on tape, your title, America
                        House director, often was instrumental in getting you out into the public
                        and bestowing on you a certain amount of prestige to do things that you
                        could not do otherwise. The title of the America House director in Frankfurt
                        was a known quantity. He was respected and he was better known than, say,
                        his boss, the public affairs officer in Frankfurt. Possibly only the consul
                        general in Frankfurt was a better known American than the American House
                        director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Senator McCarthy Plague</p>
                <p>TUCH: I say it was great fun, working in that job, although we had a number of
                    problems that involved us at that time. The principal one was the McCarthy
                    episode, and I thought maybe I should just say a couple of things about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you say a few words about it. People seem to be
                        reluctant to say very much and I think the more we get on tape, the
                        better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Senator McCarthy had zeroed in, to a large extent, on what became USIA,
                    namely the people who were involved in public diplomacy programs and, of course,
                    on the VOA, as being infiltrated by subversives, by communists, and by “enemies”
                    of the United States—enemies in quotes. Frankly, I personally felt I had nothing
                    to worry about. I was in my twenties. I was 28 at the time.</p>
                <p>I had in my lifetime belonged to only two organizations: one, the Boy Scouts of
                    America and, two, the United States Army. So I personally felt that there was
                    nothing in my record that could in any way be interpreted as being favorable to
                    the opposition, so to speak.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>My own personal experience with McCarthy came about at Easter 1953. This is by
                    way of an anecdote, but it is exemplary; it is descriptive of what kind of
                    pressures people working in USIA and public diplomacy at that time went through.
                    Incidentally, I cover this little anecdote, and this is a commercial, in a book
                    that has just been written by me and is to be published shortly by the St.
                    Martin's Press and the Institute For the Study of Diplomacy here in Washington.
                    The book is called Communicating With The World. The subject is U.S. public
                    diplomacy abroad. It covers very much the same territory, or at least in part,
                    what my oral interviews do. This particular anecdote is also described in the
                    book.</p>
                <p>And The Senator's “Junketeering Gum Shoes,” Cohn and Schine</p>
                <p>Roy Cohn and David Schine, who were Senator McCarthy's famed junketeering gum
                    shoes—that's what they were called—were coming to Germany to look at the
                    “Communist literature” in our Amerika Hauser. Since they were flying from New
                    York to Germany, they landed in Frankfurt and I was advised by my superiors in
                    Bonn that probably they would come to the America House Frankfurt first. Indeed,
                    they came to Frankfurt. I had tried to get my consul general to come to the
                    America House to be with me when they came, but he was unable to be there, he
                    had to leave town. His deputy also, was not available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: The consul general was a man with the unlikely name of Chetwin Montegue de
                    Renzy Piggott. Montegue Piggott, otherwise a very pleasant person, but he
                    obviously thought it was better for him not to be around at the time.</p>
                <p>I received a call from Henry Dunlap, in Bonn. Henry by that time had replaced
                    Mrs. Van Delden as the head of the Amerika Hauser in Germany. Henry asked, “Is
                    anybody going to be with you on this occasion?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No.” I had not been able to get anybody to hold my hand, so to
                    speak.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, you need a witness to everything you say, and I will come
                    down,” and he jumped on a train and came down, and he was there an hour or two
                    ahead of the arrival of Cohn and Schine.</p>
                <p>Now, they came in with a large entourage of correspondents who were following
                    them around. You can imagine, here is a library—it was a Saturday afternoon—a
                    library which is normally a fairly quiet place, being suddenly invaded by these
                    two people followed by a gaggle of noisy reporters.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>They came and they said, “We understand you have a lot of communist books in your
                    library. We want to see them.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't think I have any communist authors represented in the
                    library.</p>
                <p>They said, “Do you have any books by Dashiell Hammett?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I have the Thin Man and The Maltese Falcon.”</p>
                <p>And they turned to the reporters and they said, “See! Nothing but communist books
                    in this library.”</p>
                <p>This kind of interrogation went on for quite a while. We proceeded to the
                    periodical section of the library and they asked, “Where are your anti-communist
                    magazines?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Here, I have them, Time magazine.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, Time is a swear word to us,” they said. I showed them Newsweek, U.S. News
                    and World Report, Business, The Jesuit Magazine America, and so forth, and they
                    said, “Do you have the American Legion Monthly?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, we don't have the American Legion Monthly.” After all—I didn't say
                    this—but after all, we didn't want necessarily to promote military institutions
                    in Germany at that time.</p>
                <p>They said, “If you don't have the American Legion Monthly, you have no
                    anti-communist periodicals in your library.” This carried on for about 35, 40
                    minutes until, suddenly, one of my friends at the time, a young reporter by the
                    name of Marshall Loeb, who is now the editor of Fortune magazine—I have not seen
                    him in about 30 years, so I've not been in touch with him, but we were friends
                    at the time—he came up to me and said, “I'm going to get you out of this, Tom.”
                    He walked up to Cohn and said, “Mr. Cohn, my name is Marshall Loeb. I'm with the
                    United Press. I want to ask you a couple of questions.”</p>
                <p>Cohn said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>And Loeb said, “Tell me, Mr. Cohn, when are you going to burn the books here in
                    the library?”</p>
                <p>Cohn got very annoyed and said, “We're not here to burn books, we're here to find
                    communist books.”</p>
                <p>Loeb thereupon said, “Well, Mr. Cohn, my office sent me here to watch you burn
                    the books, you know, just like Hitler did in 1933.” At which moment Cohn
                    exploded, of course, and started really becoming very abusive of Marshall
                    Loeb.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Loeb calmly said, “Well, Mr. Cohn, if you're not going to burn any books here,
                    you don't interest me. Good-bye.” And he walked off. That sort of broke the ice.
                    In other words, his anger was redirected towards the journalist and away from
                    me. {Laughter}This particular episode, in the midst of which, incidentally, the
                    AP carried an item that the journalist brought to Cohn and Schine, calling them
                    “junketeering gum shoes,” and that phrase was coined by the then deputy public
                    affairs officer, Ted Kaghan, who more or less lost his job over it. The PAO,
                    Mickey Boerner, was away on a trip in Italy.</p>
                <p>At any rate, that episode exemplified the kind of pressures and the kind of
                    unpleasantness that many of us had to experience at that particular time. I must
                    say, in my case it did not sour me; primarily because I personally was not
                    affected by it. I was told later that they went through my record with a fine
                    tooth comb, but they just could not find anything on me.</p>
                <p>It, however, created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion among many, many Foreign
                    Service officers who were serving at that time.</p>

                <p>1955: Upon Departure From Germany Was Headed For Sapporo, Japan, But Redirected
                    To Head Atoms For Peace Exhibit Program Based In Washington</p>
                <p>TUCH: Right. Now, I stayed in Germany as the director of the America House
                    Frankfurt until 1955, at which time I was supposed to be transferred to Japan as
                    the branch public affairs officer, or better, American House director in
                    Sapporo. That transfer was changed when I came to Washington, because about six
                    months before that time the Agency had started a major campaign, namely the
                    promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As a result of, or as a
                    consequence of, the famous Atoms For Peace speech that President Eisenhower
                    delivered before the United Nations General Assembly in 1954, the Agency decided
                    to concentrate on this theme world-wide—to promote the peaceful uses of atomic
                    energy. I was asked to help build an exhibit in Berlin for the Berlin Industrial
                    Fair on that subject. We did do a large exhibit in Berlin, and when I came back
                    to Washington I was told to do the same thing over the next year or two for the
                    rest of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>A small task force was formed in what then was USIA's Information Center Service.
                    We were four people, a new officer by the name of Joe Fort was asked to work
                    with me, and two women who had been active in the political campaign for
                    President Eisenhower. One was Polly Canfield, who later married a USIA officer,
                    and the other one was Lisa Borrison. However, Abbott Washburn, who was the
                    deputy director of USIA, was very instrumental in pushing this new program and
                    in coordinating it. I read recently a book by H. Philipps Davison that was
                    published in the '60s; he is one of the early authors on the subject public
                    diplomacy. He describes this Atoms For Peace Program run by USIA as the first
                    coordinated program by the administration whereby USIA was involved even before
                    President Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, and was
                    consulted on the take-off of a program and not just at the landing.</p>
                <p>We built exhibits in India and Japan—you were in Japan at that time, I think, as
                    a deputy PAO to Ken Bunce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was the acting PAO when you showed up. Bunce had
                        left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right, Ken Bunce was not in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bunce had left. He had been the acting PAO, because we
                        didn't have a PAO for about a year, so I was acting PAO when you arrived.
                        Just about the time that the exhibit opened, Joe Evans and Art Hummel had
                        arrived and they then took over as the PAO and deputy PAO respectively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I see. We built this exhibit in Tokyo, very heavily supported by the
                    Yomiuri press organization which was interested in promoting the peaceful uses
                    of nuclear energy as an antidote to the fear, the prevailing fear in Japan of
                    the atomic bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also interested in promoting Mr. Shoriki, who was the
                        founder, owner and editor of the Yomiuri newspaper as the first czar in
                        Japan, or the chief of Japan's atomic energy commission, which he did become
                        as a result of that promotion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>TUCH: Right. {Laughter}Where interests combined to conduct a very useful program.
                    I also was sent to Lisbon to build an exhibit for Portugal. We built a number of
                    mobile exhibits, which traveled around Pakistan, and then in other countries. I
                    remained in that job for a little over a year. That for me was also a worthwhile
                    project. It resulted in a book which my friend, Henry Dunlap and I published a
                    couple of years later on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The atom-for-peace
                    task force was then told to concentrate on another major exhibit theme—space
                    satellite exploration. We built the first American space exhibit to be shown,
                    again, in Berlin. That too was an interesting exhibit, but immediately after it
                    opened it came a cropper, because the Soviets had sent up Sputnik and proved
                    that they were way ahead of us in space. This was not a program that we were
                    going to be able to pursue, having been left behind drastically by the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>1957: To VOA In Munich</p>
                <p>I left the exhibit program at that moment in order to go into Russian language
                    training and be trained for my assignment to Moscow. I must interrupt myself
                    because before going to the Soviet Union, I was again sent to Germany for a
                    year, this time to Munich, but with the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>At that time the Voice was broadcasting directly to the Soviet Union and to
                    Eastern Europe from its studios in Munich. I was sent to Munich as part of an
                    effort to redirect the tone and content of the Voice of America, which had been
                    an instrument of aggressive anti-communism in the early '50s. The new USIA
                    director, George Allen, wanted to change the tone and direction of the Voice of
                    America to be in line with our policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. So I spent a
                    year in Munich with the Voice as policy officer and writer of commentaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into any substantial opposition on the part of
                        the old line Germans and East Europeans who were operating in Munich at that
                        time and broadcasting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I did to some extent, indeed. Some of the people working in Munich were out
                    of touch with Washington. Many of them had never been to Washington. They had
                    been Eastern European refugees who were hired locally; they were, for the most
                    part, professional journalist and broadcasters, but they were not familiar with
                    American policy or with the United States in general so we had a few
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I remember one incident particularly where rather than trying to change the
                    commentaries and news analysis of some of the service chiefs—we were
                    broadcasting in Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, the three Baltic languages and
                    Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian—rather than trying to adjust them to the new
                    tone. I found it easier to write the commentaries and try to suggest to these
                    writers to use mine instead of theirs. In some cases that was successful. In one
                    or two it was not. I remember one service chief, who shall remain nameless,
                    looking up at me after he'd read my commentary to replace his and saying to me,
                    “I'm sorry that Senator McCarthy was not able to finish his job of getting rid
                    of all the communists in the Voice of America.” {Laughter}</p>
                <p>But this was the sort of thing that one had to experience. It was not
                    particularly painful to me. At any rate, I spent a year in Munich, not as part
                    of the regular USIA program but as VOA staffer.</p>
                <p>Back To Assignment As PAO/Berlin 1967</p>
                <p>I came back again to Germany in 1967, as the PAO in Berlin. I was coming back to
                    my hometown, the city of my birth. I had visited Berlin, but I certainly hadn't
                    lived there since 1938.</p>
                <p>Close Association With Head Of East Berlin Opera Company</p>
                <p>We spent the following three years in Berlin, again, very interesting years for
                    me personally. Of course we did not have any relationship with East Germany at
                    that time. We had no mission in East Germany so in Berlin we were expected also
                    to get over into East Berlin and to try to spend some time there to just observe
                    what was going on and to become acquainted with East Berlin. That was for me
                    particularly pleasant, especially since I was able to establish friendly
                    relationship with the then head of the principal East Berlin opera company, the
                    Komische Oper, a man by the name of Felsenstein, who was known throughout the
                    world as one of the great opera directors. We established a, to me, very
                    pleasant relationship. And that got me into East Berlin frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it create any difficulties for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No, absolutely none. This man was on the same level in the East German
                    bureaucracy as a member of the Politburo. As a matter of fact, he lived in the
                    same area as the Politburo members lived, on a huge estate. One of the humorous
                    incidents was the first time we were invited to their home , which was outside
                    of East Berlin in East Germany, and therefore out-of-bounds for us, since we
                    didn't recognize the East German Government. We were part of the occupational
                    powers of East Berlin as part of great Berlin, but we did not go into East
                    Germany. So he invited us to come to his estate. I said we couldn't come because
                    it was outside of Berlin, in East Germany. And he said, “Don't worry about this.
                    I've made all the arrangements. There will be no check on you whatsoever.”</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>So I went back to the mission and talked to our people in Bonn and they
                    suggested, “Okay. Let's do it as an experiment. Let's see what happens. But
                    don't take your passport along, because we are not recognizing the East German
                    authorities,” and they couldn't look at our passports. So with some trepidation,
                    my wife and I went over to East Berlin. We left our car at the opera house and
                    went in Felsenstein's car. He was driving a 1968 Ford V-8 station wagon, on the
                    rear window of which was an American flag, on the side windows of which were the
                    decals of our 50 states. {Laughter}Completely covered! It was a station wagon
                    which had every piece of equipment, including a television set. So we rode in
                    this very large American station wagon. When we came to the border I found that
                    we really didn't have to fear anything: the gate was up, the border guards were
                    lined on both sides of the street and gave us a military salute as we drove by
                    without slowing down. We arrived at this baronial estate. As we went through the
                    gate, there was on one side a four-car garage; there was the station wagon in
                    which we were riding; he also had one sports Mercedes and one passenger
                    Mercedes, and another American station wagon in those four garages. On the other
                    side of the gate was a stable where there were four riding horses. Over the
                    entrance hung a huge wagon-wheel chandelier that, he told me, his wife had
                    picked up in Wyoming. We drove in, and it was about as fancy a private residence
                    as I'd ever been in. Mrs. Felsenstein immediately showed us the kitchen, which
                    had only the latest General Electric equipment; dishwasher, garbage disposal,
                    refrigerator, freezer, range; nothing but General Electric. I asked her, “How
                    can you take care of this General Electric equipment over her?”</p>
                <p>She said, “That's easy. Once a month a General Electric repair truck comes from
                    West Berlin and visits the residences of every Politburo member and our
                    residence and checks all of our equipment.” {Laughter}At any rate, this is just
                    a side light of our experience in Berlin during that period of time.</p>
                <p>Enjoyment Of Opera In Both West And East Berlin</p>
                <p>My hobby is opera, and we were able to enjoy opera in Berlin, both in West Berlin
                    and East Berlin. When I recently went through my opera programs of our time in
                    Berlin, I counted up that we went to the West and East Berlin opera over 60
                    times during my three years there. At any rate, it was a very pleasant time for
                    me in Berlin. Except that it was also a very tense period politically, because
                    of the student revolution and anti-Vietnam demonstrations, which had started
                    just before we arrived in 1967. There had been the shooting of an Iranian
                    student in West Berlin by the police during an anti-Shah rally that set off
                    demonstrations and led to the big, so to speak, Easter 1968 uprising in Berlin
                    among the students led by a radical youth leader by the name of Rudy
                    Dutschke.</p>
                <p>Vietnam War Resulted In Serious Anti-AmericanAttitudes And Demonstrations In
                    Berlin</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Life in Berlin took on a definite anti-American tone during the following three
                    years, related to the Vietnam War and the opposition to it by Germans and German
                    youth especially. Our America House in Berlin was sacked, completely sacked, two
                    weekends in a row. Every window was broken. In the second incident 60 policemen
                    were hurt by students who were throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails.</p>
                <p>Free University Of Berlin Intellectually DestroyedBy Radical Students</p>
                <p>If you were trying to explain American policy or lecture at either one of the two
                    Berlin universities, you were taking some physical risks, although we did it. We
                    tried to explain American policy, but it was very tough at that time; however,
                    the students were even tougher on the university itself, especially on the
                    liberal faculty members of the Free University of Berlin. I would say that the
                    Free University of Berlin was intellectually destroyed during that time. It was
                    so badly disrupted by the students that even now it has not recovered the
                    reputation, the intellectual and academic reputation, that it had as the most
                    liberal and progressive university in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To where did the faculty go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Many of them were driven out. Several of them emigrated to the United
                    States and became teachers here. Others went to universities in West Germany,
                    especially some of the new universities that were being created at that time in
                    the Ruhr, Bielefeld and Bochum University, among them, and to universities which
                    had remained more conservative like Munich, which was not as radicalized as,
                    say, Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg were at that time. But some of the
                    universities including the Free University in Berlin were almost destroyed by
                    the radical students and the leftist assistants on the faculty at that time. Not
                    physically destroyed, but intellectually.</p>
                <p>It took many years for them to re-establish themselves. You know, people were
                    appointed administrators, presidents and rectors of these universities who had
                    absolutely no qualifications whatsoever, either as academic people or even as
                    administrators. They were radical students and assistants who took over these
                    universities and mismanaged them badly. There are some that never did recover. I
                    would say that Bremen University is one that has lost its reputation to such an
                    extent that, for instance, graduates of Bremen University have a tough time
                    finding jobs. People will just not hire them because they know they have not had
                    a good education.</p>

                    Problem</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask a question about this radical student
                        organization, or student mass movement. I don't imagine that this was a
                        home-grown thing—when I say home-grown, within Berlin. Was there something
                        that attracted large numbers of the radical student groups from other parts
                        of Germany to come into Berlin, or was it really a spontaneous thing that
                        arose within Berlin itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. Actually, the movement took place all over Western Europe. Certainly,
                    it took place in France, the Netherlands and in West Germany, and it had a very
                    close connection with the movement that was taking place in this country at that
                    time. It followed the American radicalization of some American universities. For
                    instance, the University of California in Berkeley became a model, so to speak,
                    for the radicalized students in Germany. Berlin was particularly fertile because
                    it attracted, for one thing, West German students to Berlin. Berlin was a good
                    university; I mean, the Free University of Berlin had a very fine reputation. So
                    it did attract a lot of students, but it attracted even more West German young
                    people because if you were a resident in Berlin, a student in Berlin, you were
                    exempt from the draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: So young people who were already out of sorts with the conservative
                    government in Germany, who were opposed to what we were doing in the world,
                    would drift to Berlin because they knew they could exempt themselves from
                    military service, and take part in the radical movement that was finding fertile
                    soil in Berlin. So you had more of it in Berlin than you had in West Germany,
                    but you certainly had it in West Germany. Especially, I would say, Frankfurt and
                    Hamburg were the other two major cities where the universities became
                    radicalized during that time. But it was a movement throughout the Western free
                    world; the students becoming radicalized. I think that probably it started in
                    this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably did. Although we became aware of it so gradually
                        that we weren't quite sure whether it originated simultaneously somewhere
                        else, or whether it was an ongoing thing that gradually affected western
                        Europe, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: In Germany, it was a peculiar phenomenon. This turning against the United
                    States especially by the young population was an interesting sociological
                    phenomenon, because in the 1950s and early 1060s there was a great attraction on
                    the part of Germans towards the United States. We were held up as a model.
                    During the Kennedy years, for the Germans the United States became the Camelot,
                    and President Kennedy was their model.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>America was over-sold to the Germans, that we were the perfect society, which we
                    were not, and that we should become the model for the Germans. Then in the
                    middle '60s, with the assassinations of President Kennedy, Senator Robert
                    Kennedy, Martin Luther King, with the Vietnam War, with our own civil rights
                    revolution, many young Germans suddenly became very disillusioned with America.
                    They had been over-enthusiastic about America before that, and when they found
                    out that we were not the perfect society, that we had our own problems and that
                    we had major problems in our own society, the turn-around became too abrupt.
                    Whereas we had been possibly over-sold in the '50s and early '60s, the radical
                    turn-around, the antagonism towards America, the disappointment with America was
                    also too one-sided and radical.</p>
                <p>This shift took place, I would say, between 1967 and 1972. It was almost a social
                    revolution in Germany also, and these young Germans, I remember, had the phrase,
                    “We will march through the institutions” in Germany and convert them and
                    radicalize them. Looking back from the present vantage point, it seems to me
                    that they were not successful. Germany as a society was not overturned or even
                    radicalized, except in three major institutions where they did take over these
                    institutions. These were, first, in electronic journalism, radio and television.
                    The people who run radio and television were radicalized and are now the people
                    who are still very much, so to speak, anti-American. The second element were
                    secondary school teachers, people who teach kids in the high school. The third
                    one, with which I am less familiar but I'm told that it is true, is the
                    judiciary, the judges, especially in the lower courts, who tend in all social
                    issues to make decisions which are quite radical. At any rate, in high school
                    teaching and in electronic journalism—I don't think this is true for print
                    journalism, but it is true, in my view, for electronic journalism—the radical
                    elements prevailed.</p>
                <p>In the '80s you had German kids being taught by high school teachers who had
                    become very anti-American. Everything that was bad about America—not necessarily
                    that it was not true about America, but it was too one-sided about America—was
                    emphasized in the teaching in high schools to these German kids. The Soviet
                    Union and the United States were both the same. The U.S. was a restrictive
                    society, these we were unfair, especially towards our poor, that we didn't pay
                    attention to the environment. You had the feeling created that these young
                    Germans felt sort of in the middle between two equally bad superpowers between
                    which they shouldn't make any choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess they began to feel somewhat defensive against that
                        very kind of thing—i.e., being caught helplessly between to giant
                        superpowers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. What I meant by the fact that the radicalization didn't succeed is
                    that Germany was successful in maintaining its democratic institutions, its
                    democratic society. They remained a close ally of the United States, they
                    remained part of NATO. In other words, the radicals did not succeed in turning
                    over and really revolutionizing Germany as they had wanted to do. Germany to his
                    day remains a close, respected ally and friend of the United States. The problem
                    is that at least these two elements in the German society, electronic journalism
                    and teaching, created an atmosphere that affected the young people. And we
                    realized that this was taking place, that the young people had a different
                    attitude or were taught different things about the United States than the elders
                    had. There was a difference of view on the part of young Germans vis-a-vis the
                    United States, vis-a-vis their society, vis-a-vis the East-West conflict. There
                    was a generational difference.</p>
                <p>We also realized that these young people who did not have the same experiences as
                    their elders had had in the 1950s and the 1960s, who had an entirely different
                    experience in growing up and being educated, were about to take over the
                    leadership in the German society. This is taking place right now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TUCH: And so we recognized that changes had taken place, and that we had to
                    readdress our ideas on our association with the Germans and how to deal with
                    this problem, how to cope with it in order to be able to maintain the
                    relationship that we feel is necessary to maintain. The close and friendly
                    relationship with the Federal Republic is the basis of our transatlantic
                    partnership. We—we meaning people in both the State Department and USIA—thought
                    about this quite a bit.</p>

                <p>I'm getting ahead of myself because I left Berlin in 1970, went to Brazil, and
                    didn't come back to Germany until 1980. On that occasion I was the PAO for the
                    Federal Republic. I spent 1980 to 1985, until I retired, in Bonn as my last
                    post. This whole reevaluation of our relationship, not so much governmental
                    relationship. . .</p>

                    especially between our two young peoples, became a preoccupation for us. I would
                    say, that this started already with my predecessor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you speaking now of your predecessor in 1980, or your

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>TUCH: I'm speaking of my predecessor in 1980, Alec Klieforth, who had been the
                    PAO in Bonn from 1975 until 1980, and a very close friend of mine. When I came
                    to Bonn in 1980, we felt that we had to reevaluate what we were doing in Germany
                    in order to try to correct a problem that had arisen; namely, the drifting apart
                    of our two societies, especially among what we came to call the “successor
                    generations.”</p>
                <p>USIS Revamped Youth Exchanges And Youth Programs Generally</p>
                <p>The Germans felt the same way. There were many Germans who had the same views,
                    and we talked with them at all levels; the political level, members of the
                    Bundestag, the academic level, people in the universities and the high schools,
                    on the governmental level. We both felt that we needed to correct this drifting
                    apart of our two societies, and we consulted with one another extensively on how
                    we were going to go about doing it. Both sides felt that one of the ways that we
                    should attempt to do it is by having a much greater concentration of our efforts
                    directed to the youth. On the German part, the youth in the United States; on
                    our part, the youth in Germany. Since I was in Germany, my preoccupation was,
                    obviously, with German youth. We came to realize that we should start not at the
                    university level, but already at the high school level. One, because it was in
                    the high schools that the young people were being radicalized by their teachers.
                    Secondly, that in the German democratic society, political views, attitudes,
                    prejudices were formed on the part of young people before they entered the
                    universities, while they were still in high schools. So we felt that we should
                    concentrate our efforts and direct them to German high school students. We had
                    to persuade the Agency in Washington initially on this, because dealing with
                    population elements below the university level was somewhat new. Youth programs
                    had the reputation of what they call “kiddies exchanges.” But we were able to do
                    this, with the help incidentally of a number of members in the Congress who were
                    interested in having youth exchanges take place. There were particularly people
                    like Senator Lugar of Indiana and Congressman Dante Fascell, and others, who
                    helped us persuade Charlie Wick and the USIA administration that we should
                    devote resources to a much greater extent to youth exchanges. We were, of
                    course, speaking of the industrialized world—this did not apply to the
                    developing world where our program had to be concentrated at a higher age level,
                    certainly university level, and not at the high school level—but in western
                    Europe and, specifically in this case, in Germany, we felt that it should be
                    done on a high school level.</p>

                        additional funds and legal structure for handling the high school level

                <p>The Origin Of The German/American Congress/BundestagTeenage Exchange Program</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>TUCH: Yes, it was. I must say, that once the director, Charlie Wick, who
                    initially was not at all interested in exchanges, academic or otherwise, came to
                    be persuaded that this was something that would put a feather in the President's
                    cap, he not only supported it but spearheaded what became known as the
                    President's international youth exchange initiative. The President's initiative
                    was put forward at the Versailles Summit. He—meaning Charlie Wick—became a real
                    supporter of it, and helped us get it started. But we could not have done it,
                    frankly, without prominent members of Congress. Initially, it was a budget of
                    $2.5 million on the American side and $2.5 million on the German side, which was
                    pushed through the Congress here and the Bundestag in Bonn, to start a German/
                    American Congress/Bundestag teenage exchange program; whereby, each member of
                    the Congress and each member of the Bundestag had the opportunity to nominate or
                    to sponsor one teenager to spend a year in the other country, living with a host
                    family, going to high school, becoming integrated into the community. We felt
                    strongly, and I think experience has borne us out, that such an experience of
                    total immersion of one year in another society at that age, would be an
                    experience of a lifetime, and it would permanently affect the attitude of these
                    young people towards the other country. Not that they would be uncritical, but
                    whatever attitude, whatever criticism they had would be based on fact, on their
                    experience, and not on the hearsay of what some high school teacher told
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who may not have been in the States at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right. So this became a priority of our program at a time when we were
                    having basic generational difficulties in our relationship, especially during
                    the three-year period 1981 to '84 when we had the question of the deployment of
                    intermediate range nuclear missiles, INF in Germany. We had the peace movement
                    to contend with, we had a great deal of opposition especially among the young
                    people in Germany to the deployment of additional nuclear missiles in Germany.
                    We had to deal with this particular problem. But that was a short-term problem
                    which one had to deal with and cope with. The short-term problem, in our view,
                    could be solved only if we paid attention to the long-term issue of the
                    relationship between our two societies. For that reason we concentrated on some
                    of these new long-term initiatives. Also, there were a lot of young Germans who
                    could not go to the United States on the exchange program so we also felt that
                    we should work...</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>TUCH: Well, I mean, you can accommodate only a small number of people and,
                    therefore, most young Germans would not have an actual experience in the United
                    States.So the second step we took was to intensify our efforts vis-a-vis the
                    high schools themselves to give high school teachers who were not radicalized
                    the opportunity, the resources, the facilities to teach about the United States
                    in a more realistic, we hoped, objective way. One of our programs in this area
                    was to create pedagogical resource centers for high school teachers with
                    materials about the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean within Germany?</hi>

                <p>A. “The American Studies Newsletter” Directed At 20,000 German High School
                    Teachers</p>
                <p>TUCH: Within Germany. We started a publication, it was called The American
                    Studies Newsletter, which was directed to the 20,000 German teachers who taught
                    American studies or English in German high schools. The demand for this came
                    from the German teachers. They said they needed this because they didn't know
                    where they could find and obtain good materials about America to use in their
                    teaching. So we started publishing this newsletter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIS did this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>B. At University Level, Intensified Relationships With Professors Of American
                    Studies</p>
                <p>TUCH: USIS Bonn did that independently of Washington, but with the help and
                    approval of Washington. It is a quarterly that is still going today, and is in
                    my opinion, very effective. We also intensified our relationship, changed our
                    relationship with the German Association of American Studies, which was an
                    association of German university professors who were teaching American studies,
                    primarily, at the time, American literature. We helped them reorient themselves
                    towards concentrating more on American studies as a discipline that included,
                    besides literature and language, American history, American political science,
                    American economics. We also persuaded them, worked with them, to include in
                    their membership not just university faculty members, but also high school
                    teachers, so that the high school teachers could benefit from that organization
                    as much as the university professors could. In other words, our concentration
                    became one of trying to reach the younger generation of Germans at an earlier
                    age and much more intensively than we had been able to do for the previous 20
                    years, and thereby to cement the relationship, to rebuild the bridge, so to
                    speak, or to surmount the gap that had been created.</p>

                        YFU on this side, or did that take part completely outside the confines of

                <p>TUCH: It was a cooperative effort because the Germans were just as interested as
                    we were in this project. They recognized this need also, and they became equal
                    supporters in this youth exchange program, which is managed by Youth for
                    Understanding with the help also of AFS and Experiment in International Living.
                    It was a joint effort and jointly financed by the two governments, although
                    organizations like Youth for Understanding had already carried out a
                    German/American teenage exchange program privately, and still do. But this

                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. They were converted in the '50s already, when we could no longer
                    maintain so many Amerika Hauser, into German-American Institutes. I always felt
                    that these institutes gave us good value for our investment. We usually paid the
                    salary of the director and maintained the library and the programming in these
                    centers; whereas the Germans, whether it was a local institution, the city, the
                    state or federal German Government or a combination of these institutions, would
                    pay for the rents and the utilities and the local staff salaries. Our investment
                    was approximately 40%, the German investment in these institutions was about
                    60%, but I always felt that we were getting 80% value for our 40% investment
                    and, therefore, it was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these institutes in Germany in some part
                        self-sustaining, like the binational centers, say, in Latin America? That
                        they developed programs, particularly English teaching but some other
                        programs also, for which they charged certain fees and, therefore, were able
                        to, outside even the German Government's contribution, were able to finance
                        some of their own activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: That's correct, they were. They, however, required and appreciated our
                    assistance and they remained really American institutions by virtue of the fact
                    that the director was an American. This has changed in the last four years.
                    Budgetary restrictions have forced a reduction of our support to these
                    binational centers, these German-American institutes. They are still running but
                    no longer with as much American input as they had until about 5 years ago. But
                    the Amerika Hauser still exist. Our program of lectures using American
                    participants is very large. The academic exchange program, the Fulbright
                    program, is still the largest in the world. It's, I think, a $5 million program,
                    in which the Germans participate as more than equal partners. In the late 1960s,
                    American budgetary restrictions forced us to reduce our support of the
                    German-American academic exchange program. The Germans felt so strongly about
                    this program that they decided to make up the difference in what we no longer
                    could contribute. So until the early '80s, the ratio was that the Germans
                    contributed 75% to the budget of the Fulbright program, and we 25%. Over the
                    last five or six years, we have been able to bring it again almost to half and
                    half, but the Germans are, at a minimum, very equal partners in this
                    program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's much the same thing as has happened in Japan, where
                        for a number of years the Japanese have given almost 50% of the funding, and
                        at one point, I think, they went beyond 50%. I don't know exactly what has
                        happened in the last couple of years. Do you think this pretty well covers
                        what you want to say?</hi>

                <p>TUCH: I think this pretty well covers. Again, I shouldn't plug a book, but what I
                    have not contributed in these oral interviews and possibly in a more theoretical
                    way, is explained in the book that will be published by St. Martin's Press in
                    the next few months on the practice of public diplomacy by the U. S. Government.
                    I'm sure the USIA library and Georgetown University library will have a copy of
                    this book to supplement what has been said here. (Its full title is
                    Communicating With The World: U.S. Public Diplomacy Overseas.)</p>
                <p>— Note: I served as PAO (and DCM) in Brazil from 1981 to 1985. That assignment
                    and that period are not covered in any of the three oral history interviews
                    conducted with me. One of the four case studies included in my book,
                    Communicating With The World, deals, however, with conducting a public diplomacy
                    program under a military dictatorship in Brazil. The case study covers most of
                    the material I would have discussed in an interview.HNT</p>
