                <p>Interviewed by: Victor Wolf, Jr.</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 24, 1986</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the first of a series of interviews on the theme
                        “Movement of Peoples as an Issue in American Foreign Policy.” Mr. Kennedy
                        was in the Foreign Service of the United States from 1955 to 1985, and has
                        much experience in consular and movement of peoples issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>First of all, Mr. Kennedy, could you give us some idea about why it is that you
                    entered the Foreign Service and then why it is that you spent most of your
                    career in consular affairs?</p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Vic, just to be brief, I came into the Foreign Service mainly because of
                    language. This sounds silly, because anyone who knows me, knows I am an abysmal
                    linguist, but when I went away to school, I graduated from Kent School in 1946,
                    they had a very rigorous language program. In those days, everyone who went
                    there took at least three years of Latin and three years of French, and then you
                    had to take something else or continue in Latin and French. I barely made it
                    through, but I ended up by taking my three years of Latin, three years of
                    French, and two years of Spanish.</p>
                <p>With that language background, I very prudently did not take any language when I
                    went to college. I graduated from Williams at the end of May 1950 and the Korean
                    War started on June 25. I was not a veteran. I decided it would be a good idea
                    to go into the Air Force, rather than the infantry. When I appeared at basic
                    training before the sergeant, they asked me if I had had any languages. I said,
                    “Sergeant, I did very poorly in them, but, of course, I did have three years of
                    Latin, three years of French, and two years of Spanish.” Wham! I went
                    immediately to the Army Language School and took Russian for a year, again at
                    which I did rather poorly, but I did take Russian, and it sent me overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>While overseas, I was very interested in living abroad, so I thought I would take
                    a crack at the Foreign Service exam, which before I never would have considered.
                    But because I did have some Russian and had had a full year of it, I thought
                    maybe I might be able to pass the language part of the exam. I had served in
                    both South Korea and a little bit in North Korea during the war, Japan, and then
                    in Germany. So I took the exam while I was in Germany, oddly enough at the
                    Consulate General in Frankfurt. In those days, it was a three-and-a-half day
                    exam. I passed the written part. I did not pass the language part. They would
                    allow you to take a make-up exam when you came into the Foreign Service. So I
                    moved on.</p>
                <p>I got a master's degree at Boston University under the G.I. Bill, and I took
                    courses in diplomatic history. I took the Foreign Service exam and came in, in
                    July '55.My class was the first of a whole new series of classes of junior
                    officers. Prior to that, there had been a hiatus of junior Foreign Service
                    officers being trained together and then going out in the field because it was
                    during the McCarthy era, and they weren't recruiting very many people in the
                    Foreign Service. Then the State Department was geared up again to start a whole
                    new series of regular recruitment of junior Foreign Service officers, and I was
                    one of about 25 that came in at this new period of recruitment. I had no idea
                    what I wanted to be at the time, and I was told that consular work was to be
                    avoided, but my first assignment, along with about five or six of our other
                    junior officers, was to deal with the Refugee Relief Program. This Refugee
                    Relief Act had been passed a year or two before, which was designed to deal with
                    refugees who were still left in the refugee camps throughout Western Europe. Do
                    you remember what the Act was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Displaced Persons Act, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was the Displaced Persons Act before, which had gotten most of
                    displaced refugee type people that had moved from being displaced to being
                    refugees, but they were basically the same people. This was an Act designed to
                    get those people who still were coming out from behind the Iron Curtain. This
                    was ten years after the war, but many of these people had been in refugee camps
                    since the end of the war, for over ten years. Congress passed this Act to do
                    something about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollection of what the total numbers
                        were in the camps when you first started doing this work in 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I don't. I really don't. I know we had two different types of people
                    there. One, some who for some reason or another who had been rejected by the
                    Displaced Persons Act; we had the feeling, that law had been rather casually
                    administered, and a good number of people who probably should have been
                    qualified under it fell between the cracks and were still there. We also had
                    people coming out from Yugoslavia, Poland, from the Soviet Union, but mainly in
                    Eastern Europe, who had gotten across from East Germany and who had established
                    themselves as refugees. So we had the two types.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, you had one group who were essentially
                        sufferers under the Nazis during the period of the Third Reich, and then you
                        had the second group, those who came out, fleeing from the tyranny of what
                        in those days was called the Stalinist imperialism, if you will.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. Actually, there was a third type. I did not deal with it
                    personally, but this was a very political Act. So that we had people who were in
                    a very large program in Italy, a very large program in, of all places, Holland,
                    but Italy had some refugee camps, Holland had none. But the law was very
                    gradually interpreted for purely political motives, to allow large numbers of
                    Dutch and Italians to come in beyond the normal quota. The reason for this was
                    that I think the head of the judicial committee in the House was run by Emmanuel
                    Celler of New York City, whose district included a fairly substantial Italian
                    community. He was a Democrat. On the Republican side, the minority member was a
                    lady who came from Holland, Michigan, which had a lot of Dutch coming there, and
                    they wanted to get more in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that was the district that subsequently was held
                        by President Gerald Ford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It may well have been. So you had this sort of aberration of the law. I
                    was assigned to Frankfurt, Germany, as a number of the other young officers came
                    in with me, assigned to this Refugee Relief Program, but it was not to be our
                    career. This was just a normal vice consular job which people had, but we were
                    specifically designated as Refugee Relief officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of that program in Frankfurt when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We had a consul general, John Burns, who later became Director General
                    of the Foreign Service. This program was run, really, quite separately from the
                    consulate general. We were eventually moved to a separate building. The man who
                    was in charge of it was a man named David Kravetz. David Kravetz had been
                    basically a file room clerk, rather poorly educated, but a real hard-charging
                    operator. Initially, the Refugee Relief Program was very small and really almost
                    unworkable.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Let me explain why it was unworkable. The law specified that before anybody got a
                    visa under the Refugee Relief Act, they had to have a thorough background check.
                    Usually this meant that they were investigated. We worked out of Army's CID or
                    whatever. They did a lot of interviews and all. Then if they passed all these
                    interviews, they were sent to Refugee Relief officers like myself, and
                    evaluated. Mainly we asked for more information. Then they came up to be
                    interviewed, both by a State Department officer, a vice consul, and then if they
                    passed that, they went next door to an office of the Immigration Service, which
                    was quite an innovation that they actually had an office right there, so they
                    were interviewed by the Immigration officer. Often, the Immigration officer
                    would be a little more hard-nosed than the State Department officer, and would
                    turn them down. But it wasn't a very workable situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would it be that the Immigration and Naturalization
                        Service officer was more hard-nosed than the State Department officer? Would
                        it have something to do with perceptions of foreign policy, or would there
                        be other reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think it was really that you've got to look at the type of person who
                    came in. The Immigration officer, for the most part, had been on the beat back
                    in the United States. Immigration officers generally turn people down if they
                    can, because they think of the problem of catching people after the fact. So
                    they looked at the law more literally and thought of the problems that might
                    occur later on. I think the typical young vice consul who was thrown into this
                    program would think in terms of foreign policy it was a good thing to relieve
                    Europe of the burden of refugees while it was recovering from the war, and
                    “isn't it nice to be nice to these people, and they really need it,” and not
                    really thinking about maybe the repercussions if you let the wrong person in.
                    The Immigration officer had to chase them around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then talking about the management program, where
                        the head of the program in Frankfurt perhaps compounded it by not being
                        particularly well-trained. You said it was virtually unmanageable. I wonder
                        if you could continue along that line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was really not so much the situation. As a matter of fact, it was the
                    law that was unmanageable. David Kravetz, for all his crudity, was really not
                    the administrative problem. I was somewhat nonplused in being part of the
                    Refugee Relief team. I rather expected I was going to be getting into a rather
                    fancy outfit. I'd heard for years about the Foreign Service, and I thought we'd
                    be sitting around in striped pants, drinking tea. The Refugee Relief Act was
                    quite a change.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>No, the problem was that the Refugee Relief Act was administered out of Bonn, and
                    basically bypassing the consul general, which made Consul General Burns mad as
                    hell. We creatures of the Refugee Relief Act, although regular Foreign Service
                    officers, were sort of ignored, and we felt very much outcast. But the problem
                    was that with the investigation system and the two key system, the vice consul
                    had a pass and then the Immigration officer had a pass, and a rather slow and
                    cumbersome investigation period, very few cases were coming before us. We had
                    several interviews a day, and that was about it.</p>
                <p>The program was to end at the end of 1956, on December 31, 1956. Well, about
                    eight or nine months before that, voices began to be raised in Congress, saying,
                    “We authorized so and so many people.” I don't remember the figures, but in the
                    Refugee Relief Act you can see a certain number there. And we weren't even
                    approaching that. Many congressmen and senators were saying, “What is this? You
                    people aren't doing this.” So the political heat was on, and all of a sudden we
                    geared up. Towards the end, we were working literally 12 hours a day, seven days
                    a week, interviewing, rushing people through. The whole process was cut
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the time that was involved in processing a case
                        was reduced.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Absolutely. The investigations became cursory in many cases, and
                    sometimes, depending on the crowd we had at the door, we were interviewing
                    people after the Immigration officer had, and vice versa. I think technically
                    they had to be the second, but we would do it any way. We were going after
                    numbers, rather than making sure the case was done well. It was a very
                    complicated situation, because for us to sort out the problems, really the
                    problems of Europe during the war and post-war decades, it was very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>To give an example, we were dealing with Russians, some were anti-Communist, some
                    had served with General Vlasov against the Soviets, others had left at different
                    times of the Soviet regime and had fled to the West. All of them were denouncing
                    each other. The investigators essentially stopped asking hard questions. We had
                    people who came up before us who had been accused of being Nazis. [Tape recorder

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were discussing the various strange groups of people
                        who had come out of the Soviet Union, everyone denouncing everyone else, the
                        people who were in the Vlasov Army, and the like.</hi>

                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. It was not just people from the Soviet Union, but from other
                    places, too. In fact, what you really had was a not very trained group of
                    people, and I include both the young Foreign Service officers, as well as the
                    Immigration officers dealing with the complexities of the post-war problems of
                    Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I would love to give you an example of a place I knew more about, and that was
                    Yugoslavia. You had Chetniks, you had Communists, you had Ustashi, you had
                    Albanian separatists, you had Bulgarian separatists, Macedonian nationalists,
                    you had Hungarians; everybody got into the act. They all hated each other. So
                    the people who were doing the investigations, they would get all sorts of
                    denunciations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel you have more you want to talk about of this
                        part of your career, or do you want to move on to some of the other posts
                        and assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I would like to talk just a little more about this, because it was my
                    first real exposure to how things actually worked in the Government.</p>
                <p>Vice consuls, for the most part, were more partisan in favor of our clients, as
                    opposed to the Immigration officers, who had, as I described before, a different
                    attitude. Often, if we had a case that we felt very strongly about, sometimes we
                    would do a little bargaining, because we were right next door: “I won't fight
                    you on this one if you'll let this one go.” Because if there was a protest, you
                    could appeal these cases, at least to the immediate boss. There was a certain
                    amount of horse trading.</p>
                <p>Another one was that as the Act began to wind down, I saw something that was an
                    eye-opener to me and remained an eye-opener for me the rest of my career, and
                    that's how things can be done in the Government. Because Washington wanted to
                    pin the blame on somebody it wanted to find out where the bottlenecks were, they
                    had a very statistical sort of matrix, to show where each case was located. Was
                    it with INS, with Public Health, with the investigators? Who was holding things
                    up? So we used to keep these figures. I watched David Kravetz manipulate these
                    figures to make sure that the blame didn't fall on us; it was Public Health's
                    fault or the Immigration Service or the investigators' fault.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that he did significant manipulating to
                        really shift blame, or would you say that the way it came out in reporting
                        was the way it actually was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I would say a bit of both. These things are open to interpretation, and
                    creative interpretation could put the blame somewhere else. Actually, we were
                    moving things rather quickly in our case, and everything got very superficial
                    treatment. I have been asked by investigators from the Department of Justice in
                    the 1980s about our procedures back in the 1950s. They are catching some war
                    criminals who slipped through our very loose investigatory net and who were
                    subsequently identified thirty years later. These young attorneys who were not
                    born or were in swaddling clothes at the time we were pushing refugees into the
                    U.S. obviously don't understand how we operated in those days of political
                    pressure and that we knew that there would be questions later, but under the
                    circumstances it was “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sense of the numbers that were processed
                        under the Refugee Relief Act during 1955-58? I realize that these statistics
                        can be found in the appropriate documentation, but would you say that what
                        you did made a significant dent in the number of refugees, displaced
                        persons, and others? In other words, at the end of the Act, were there more
                        than there had been before, less than there had been before? And if there
                        were more, was it because new people were coming, or what exactly was the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'm not sure. It was a significant Act when you added it all together,
                    including those from Italy and from Holland, where there in Italy and in
                    Holland, for example, they qualified under the Act if their house was bombed
                    during the war and they had to move across the street. Literally, that made them
                    refugees. Purely a political interpretation, but the idea was to get them in.
                    When you add it all up, we did pretty well clean out most of the camps by this
                    Act. But as far as the figures go, I am afraid I can't tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see that you were in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia from 1958
                        to 1960. What kind of work did you do there, and could you give us some
                        indications about special problems insofar as it related to movement of
                        peoples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Once again, I was assigned, as often happened to junior officers, to
                    another vice consul's slot, as the sole consular officer in Dhahran. I was a
                    little unhappy with this, because I thought now is the time to become a real
                    honest to God diplomat, as I'd been told that is the job one should aspire to,
                    and to do that, you really have to go to an embassy, but I went to where I was
                    ordered.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We had very little immigration on the part of the Saudis. But we had a rather
                    large number of Yemenis who came in, because at that time we had no post at
                    Sanaa in Yemen, and they would come to our consulate there because also our
                    consulate covered all of the Persian Gulf, except for Kuwait. At that time,
                    there were British protectorates at Bahrain and Qatar and the southern states.
                    So we got the Yemenis to appear with some sort of handwritten, so-called
                    documentation and petitions which had been approved by the Immigration Service
                    from their brother in usually Youngstown, Ohio, or Lackawanna, New York, as I
                    recall. Most of them were working in the steel mills</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the Yemenis you're talking about are from what
                        is now North Yemen, not South Yemen, because South Yemen presumably was
                        covered by our consulate in Aden, am I correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'm not sure. I suppose so, but many of these Yemenis also were working
                    in the oil fields. They were hired to work in the oil fields in Saudi Arabia or
                    the Emirates, and they would move up. Many of these cases were rather dubious.
                    There wasn't much we could do about it. “Brother,” I think, was a very loose
                    term; they were often cousins. But they had passed the scrutiny of INS, so they
                    were issued visas.</p>
                <p>Another visa function was to go to Bahrain, where there were a lot of Indians and
                    a few others there, and the law at that time excluded people from what was
                    called the Asian Pacific Triangle, which meant that we issued, I think, to
                    people who were born in India, maybe 100 a year. I would have people come up in
                    Bahrain as I'd step off the plane. I'd go there once a month. They'd say, “How
                    is my case coming along?” I'd look at it and say, “Well, it's moving. Instead of
                    130 years, you only have 125 years to wait.” I mean, literally of that nature
                    until the great reform of 1967 came.</p>
                <p>One case I do remember was Iraqi Jews who were refugees in Bahrain, and they were
                    going to St. Louis, where they had a brother, jewelers, I believe. I got a
                    little touch of the old sort of Biblical history, because I noticed that the
                    young men of the family referred to two women, who, according to my records, one
                    was the wife of the principal applicant, and the other was his sister-in-law,
                    but the young men both referred to her as “mother.” According to Jewish custom,
                    he had taken her on as his wife, although I think they were all in their '60s or
                    '70s at the time. So I carefully had to coach the young man, “For God's sake,
                    don't call this sister-in-law, your aunt, 'mother' when you get to the
                    Immigration office, or they won't understand, and you might all get kicked out
                    because of bigamy.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had an assignment in Washington in the Bureau of
                        Intelligence and Research, and you also had Serbo-Croatian language
                        training. But then I think the next big assignment you had that touches on
                        this issue was as consul in Belgrade from 1962 to 1967. One of the things
                        that would strike me as being significant here was the juxtaposition of our
                        having essentially friendly relations with a Communist state, on the one
                        hand, and the very stringent anti-Communist position laid down in the
                        McCarran-Walters Act when it comes to visa issuances. Was that a major
                        preoccupation for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, it was, because we wanted to encourage nonimmigrant travel of the
                    elite, the people we thought would return to Yugoslavia after visiting the
                    United States. It was the only Communist country at that time with whom we had
                    really close relations, but we had this law that just said if you were a member
                    of the Communist Party or something, you had to get a waiver. The Immigration
                    Service was really very good with this, because we could call the Immigration
                    Service. They had posts in Vienna and in Frankfurt. And I could get a waiver
                    over the phone, if necessary. But emigration created some problems, because many
                    of the people who came to us would have been affiliated one way or the other,
                    usually not Communist Party members, but they'd belong to the Workers Alliance
                    or the Communist League, this type of thing. We would have to find out whether
                    or not they were significant members or just rank and file members.</p>
                <p>George Kennan felt his importance, because at that point he was a well-known
                    historian and political thinker, as well as being somebody who had left the
                    Foreign Service, and had been personally picked by President Kennedy for the
                    position. So I had trouble, because every time I had a visa case that caused me
                    problems, he was quite willing to get on the phone and call up Robert Kennedy,
                    who was Attorney General at the time, to straighten it out, and I didn't think
                    this was the right way to do this. You usually got around it by sort of going at
                    a lower level.</p>
                <p>Our problem there in Yugoslavia was really both the Communist side and dealing
                    with getting waivers, but also initially nonimmigrant visas for so-called
                    visitors who actually planned to go to the United States. We had a great deal of
                    trouble sorting out the “good visitors” from the “bad visitors.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that in other Eastern European countries, there are
                        several categories of what are called “bad visitors.” One category are those
                        who use the non-immigrant visa to come to the United States and stay
                        permanently; the other are those who use the non-immigrant visa to go to the
                        United States, work for a number of years, save their American dollar
                        earnings as much as they can, and then when they return to their country,
                        they are in a very good financial situation to live well. I know, for
                        example, that this is a pattern or was, at any rate, in the late '70s, as
                        far as Poland was concerned. Did you encounter that sort of thing in
                        Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Not as much as in some other countries, but we had our problems. Western
                    Macedonia was a particular thorn in the consular side. There was an extensive
                    Macedonia community in some of the factory towns of our Midwest, especially in
                    Gary, Indiana. We would sometimes get a busload of men and women from the little
                    town of Ljubojno, near Bitola, asking for visitors' visas. Our experience was
                    that most were going to stay as that was the pattern. It was no fun to sit and
                    interview person after person, often young peasant women who were going to Gary
                    or the like to be presented at the local Macedonia Hall for the bachelors of the
                    community to look over and select them for their brides, and house servants (the
                    wedding came first and then the house work came immediately thereafter).
                    Sometimes we would break down and take a chance hoping that some of our visitors
                    might return. I remember issuing one visa and noting on the approval card that
                    the young lady I was issuing the visa to was so lacking in physical attributes
                    of beauty that I was sure she would not be asked to stay. She was married within
                    a month of entry. I sometimes think that the good citizens of the Gary should
                    put up a monument to the consular officers whose mistaken judgments made the
                    population of their city grow.</p>
                <p>In 1967 Montreal had a world's fair, called Expo '67. Air Yugoslavia arranged for
                    special charter flights to go to Canada for those who wanted to see the fair.
                    The flights stopped off in the United States so we were in the transit visa
                    business. We were flooded with applicants who wanted to see the fair. Now there
                    were special air fares which was an inducement, but we were very suspicious when
                    we had busloads of people coming up for visas who had never even been to
                    Belgrade before, but suddenly had a yen to see a fair in Canada. We had to turn
                    down many of these visas, much to the annoyance of the airline people.</p>
                <p>We had many people who were getting Social Security benefits, who had been
                    working in the United States, some through the war years, all had returned and
                    were living rather well on what we would normally consider to be a modest
                    pension, but in Yugoslavia at the time, it was significant. They had left their
                    families behind. But the ones we were getting at that point were people who were
                    just trying to get out. Yugoslavia was depressed and it was a little hard to get
                    money back, and so the ones that were going were trying, as far as we knew, to
                    settle permanently, but it was a little hard to judge at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else do you think was significant, as far as movement
                        of peoples is concerned, with regard to the five years you were in

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: We did deal with the problem of escapees. Yugoslavia was sort of a
                    semi-closed window for the rest of Eastern Europe. Many Eastern Europeans could
                    get into Yugoslavia for vacations, for business trips, but they couldn't get
                    into the West, because they would appear to be defecting, leaving. We spent a
                    good bit of our time interviewing people from East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
                    Hungary, Romania, not really from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, who would see the
                    American flag and felt they were there in Yugoslavia, feeling somewhat
                    anonymous, felt they could come and talk with them about getting out, seeking
                    refuge. We couldn't give refuge to them because they were not in imminent
                    danger.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't give legation asylum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We couldn't give legation asylum. Then they would ask us, “How do I get
                    to Italy or Greece?” which were the two main places to go. We would have to say,
                    “We can't advise you to do this,” because we had a concern about our relations
                    with the Yugoslavs. But we'd say, “If I were doing this, I certainly wouldn't
                    try this border crossing point. Maybe this one. We've heard people go through
                    here.” So we'd give them a certain amount of direction. The Yugoslav attitude
                    was sort of “iffy,” because they didn't want to be the prison guards for these
                    people, but at the same time, they didn't want to lose their credibility with
                    the rest of the Communist world. So sometimes they would pick them up at the
                    border; other times they'd just shoo them back; other times they'd turn a blind
                    eye and let them go across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sense as to the percentages who fell in
                        each category?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'd hate to judge. There was a significant number of people,
                    particularly during the summer months, who came to us to ask for assistance,
                    including people from other Communist countries, on getting out. We would talk
                    to them and listen to them, try to give them as good advice as we could without
                    jeopardizing our position with the Yugoslavs.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Before finishing with Yugoslavia I should mention the problems of fraud. They
                    were not significant as compared to many other countries, but we had our
                    problems. I had received a few unsubstantiated complaints about our chief visa
                    clerk, Madam Zhukov. She was a very distinguished elderly lady who was in charge
                    of quota control, which called forth immigrant visa applicants when their
                    registration date was reached. It was hard for me to believe that she was
                    engaged in some sort of shady deal, and the allegations were vague. I checked
                    out whatever I could, but they smacked of sour grapes, of people who did not get
                    visas for perfectly legitimate reasons. Then one day I was called early in the
                    morning and told that Madam Zhukov had died in her sleep. After going to her
                    apartment to pay my respects, she was lying on her bed while all of us gathered
                    around and mumbled nice things about her, I returned to my office. There I had
                    to immediately settle the line of succession. The other Yugoslav ladies who had
                    worked under Madam Zhukov were all atwitter over who would take her place, with
                    all sort of rumors going around about what I was planning to do. At that point I
                    was not planning anything but to get through the day. But the concern was such
                    that I had to settle the matter right away. During my conversations with the
                    potential successors I learned that Madam Zhukov had indeed been taking
                    advantage of the system. She would take a perfectly straightforward case shortly
                    before we were due to set up an appointment for an interview and to issue the
                    immigrant visa, call up the person and make a big show of going through the
                    file, tisk-tisking and making discouraging sounds as she read the file. This
                    would make the applicant nervous and ask what the problem was? Madam Zhukov
                    would say that there were difficulties and she was not sure if a visa could be
                    issued. The applicant would ask what should be done and Madam Zhukov would
                    suggest that they see a lawyer, and give a name. The applicants usually rose to
                    the bait and did that, with the lawyer and Madam Zhukov splitting the fee. Since
                    the visa was almost always issued there were few complaints, and the ones I
                    received were not specific enough. The ladies of the visa unit saw this but were
                    afraid of the Grande Dame and said nothing until she was dead, and told all
                    within a few hours.</p>
                <p>Another learning experience for me was on how to treat instructions from the
                    Department. I discovered the hard way that you really have to look at everything
                    from the local point of view and modify, if necessary. In 1966 or 1967 there was
                    a major reform of the visa law which eliminated, among other things, the
                    possibility of anyone signing up for a visa with little hope of ever being
                    called. We had people who were registered as non-preference applicants who had
                    no close relatives in the U.S. or line of work that would qualify them under the
                    law, but they could put their names down on the list prior to the law reform. We
                    had almost 100,000 on our waiting list and just from a office point of view it
                    was a major burden since we were always having to answer letters and explaining
                    that the waiting list was not moving, etc. The new law allowed us to cancel
                    these applications after we explained that they had to be qualified, by job or
                    close relative, which meant either parents, spouse, child or brothers or sisters
                    in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The Department sent us a form letter that we were to translate into Serbian and
                    send out to everyone. We expected that we would be able to cancel thousands and
                    thousands of registrations after the applicants realized they did not qualify
                    and did not reply to our letter asking if they did indeed have relatives or work
                    that made them eligible. Unfortunately I had the form letter transcribed
                    literally. Now in Serbian (and Croatian) there is a very complicated
                    relationship system with special names for every relationship, including those
                    of cousins on both sides of the family. Included in these names were the use of
                    “brother from the aunt” or “sister from the uncle” denoting cousins, sometimes
                    quite far removed. In normal talk the Serbs would refer to their cousins as
                    “brothers or sisters” so when our letter went out all the applicants noted that
                    they did indeed have “brothers” or “sisters” in the United States. Everyone in
                    Yugoslavia has some sort of cousin in the U.S.! It took another mailing and much
                    correspondence to untangle this mess. I should have said to my staff, “Look this
                    over and see if there are any problems” but I just said “Translate i.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that in '67 to '68, you were a personnel officer
                        in the Department of State. My assumption is that you were dealing with
                        assignments to consular positions of Foreign Service officers. Is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. If you look at my career, you'll see that when I left Saudi Arabia
                    and I came to INR, which is essentially a political job dealing with the Horn of
                    Africa, I was reaching a crucial point within the Foreign Service, and that was
                    that I really should have had an assignment that was a fully diplomatic one,
                    political or economic type officer, after that. Yet I liked consular work very
                    much, and I wanted to go to Eastern Europe. So when I got a chance to go to
                    Yugoslavia as a consular officer, I took it with the idea of, “I'll be a
                    consular officer and get out very quickly and try to move into another section.”
                    But I found the work so much fun, being my own boss. And political and economic
                    work, although the five years I was in Yugoslavia, I was offered the chance to
                    move into those sections, I found that I'd be number three or four man in one of
                    those sections, and having run an office, it would have been quite a comedown
                    for me personally, although in Foreign Service terms, this would be a promotion,
                    because in those days, consular work was looked down upon.</p>
                <p>I say this only as preface to being in personnel and looking after consular
                    appointments, because this was the beginning of, you might say, a new corps of
                    Foreign Service officers who were interested in consular work. The Department of
                    State was beginning to have some concern about the rather poor personnel they
                    had as consular officers, because although we had an exam process to recruit
                    officers, the majority of people who rose to positions as beyond the vice consul
                    position, consuls in consular sections, were usually a man or woman who had
                    entered through secretarial and courier, clerical, and moved up because the
                    regular Foreign Service officers had abandoned the field.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this mean that at least until the latter part of the
                        '60s, generally speaking, career consular officers had not really entered
                        through the Foreign Service examination route?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This is true. There is a very sound reason for doing it. One, consular
                    work was looked down upon, but there's a very practical reason. Until about, I'd
                    say as an arbitrary date, the mid-'60s, no consular officer identified as really
                    a career counselor officer, somebody who had done this most of their career, had
                    become higher than an FSO-3, in those days equivalent to the colonel status in
                    the military. Nobody had achieved the ranks of FSO-2 or FSO-1. Those now, I
                    think, are designated as FS-1 or FS-2, the minister consular rank. Things were
                    just changing about '67 or '68, when I came into personnel. I think two women
                    officers became FSO-2s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the officers that you were working with in
                        personnel on the upgrading of the consular career? What particularly did
                        they bring to that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: In the first place, there was a new Acting Administrator for Security
                    and Consular Affairs, and that was Barbara Watson, who was a very dynamic
                    person. She was insisting that consular people be more qualified. My immediate
                    boss was Loren Lawrence. We were both FSO-3s at the time. I might say that my
                    career sort of blossomed in Yugoslavia. When I started to go there, I was FSO-6
                    when I was assigned to Yugoslavia for language training. By the time I left, I
                    was FSO-3.</p>
                <p>Lorie Lawrence later became ambassador to Jamaica and was head of the Passport
                    Office, had a rather good career. But both Lorie and I were just beginning to
                    tell people “no” when they wanted to enter consular ranks. I mean, if they
                    weren't qualified, we would say no. It often had been used as a way to encourage
                    or to reward people in the clerical ranks to move up without regard to would
                    they make a good consular officer. We were beginning to look harder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other issues that you dealt with as
                        you were doing consular staffing service? For example, in what way did you
                        relate to the people in the personnel assignment system who were working on
                        senior training — the War Colleges, for example? Were you able to begin to
                        get the personnel system sensitized to assign consular officers who were
                        worthwhile, to significant training assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I don't think so. If I recall, I think Lorie Lawrence was the first
                    person who was a real consular officer to get assigned to senior training. There
                    may have been others, but somebody who, as a matter of policy, went there. Maybe
                    I was the second one to go to senior training myself. No, we had a lot of
                    trouble with personnel, because the normal personnel people, for 50 years, had
                    been able to use consular assignments as a way of sort of dumping people or
                    rewarding people, again, irrespective of the qualifications. We were beginning
                    to resist this, and this caused a lot of trouble, because we were getting a lot
                    of people unhappy in the personnel system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see that from the Department, you went in 1969 and '70
                        to Saigon as consul general. This, of course, was at the height of our
                        involvement there, but at the same time, shortly after it became obvious
                        that we were going to be reducing our military presence there and hopefully
                        eliminating it as quickly as possible. Do you think you could tell us
                        something about the consular work in Saigon, movement of peoples who were in
                        Saigon during that period of '69 and '70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The interesting thing, really, is that there wasn't a great press for
                    visas. The war wasn't going too badly. I arrived in February 1969, and I left in
                    July 1970. Those 18 months, American troops were beginning to disengage, the war
                    had gone rather well, the Viet Cong had exhausted itself in the Tet Offensive
                    the year before I arrived, and the situation was, you might say, upbeat. Another
                    thing that one has to remember is that the Vietnamese themselves really loved
                    their families, loved their homes. You might think, “Gee, everybody wants to get
                    out of here.” There wasn't much of this. Some professionals had left, but if
                    they were going anywhere, they would probably try to go to France rather than
                    the United States. So our main emigration was wives of G.I.'s, and even those
                    might get their visas, but then they would go to the United States, take a look
                    around, and say, “To hell with this,” and many of them came back and kept their
                    green cards [alien registration cards]. But our problem was often trying to tell
                    the American husbands that their wife, who had gone home to see the family, she
                    really wasn't being trapped back in Vietnam; she just didn't want to come back
                    at that point.</p>
                <p>Prostitutes were always a problem for consular officers where ever American
                    soldiers are stationed, and we had about half a million G.I.s in Vietnam at one
                    point. The consular problem was that prostitutes were not eligible for visas
                    under the law and the only way around the problem was if a special act of
                    Congress was passed for each exception. Congressmen were not happy about having
                    to introduce special legislation for constituents who had married prostitutes,
                    consuls were unhappy about the paperwork and investigations that had to be done
                    on each case, and the men marrying these girls were not only unhappy, but angry
                    at the consuls for impeding their brides from coming back to their homes. During
                    the Vietnam war Congress changed the law to make it easier, and we consuls
                    breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Some of the girls that the soldiers would become involved with were pretty
                    unattractive and I wonder how they made out when brought home. They looked
                    pretty good after being out in the jungle, but I suspect that most of these
                    marriages did not last and the girls were thrown on their own resources,
                    generally back to prostitution at massage parlors, within a short time. I
                    remember we would get letters from time to time from a ex-soldier asking us to
                    locate “Jenny (or Mary, Susie) etc. who lived in the third “hooch” [hut] in the
                    prostitute section of Vung Tau, the local R &amp; R [Rest and Rehabilitation]
                    area near Saigon and ask her to marry him.” We would try to help and sometimes
                    could locate the young ladies and put them in touch with their loved ones in
                    America. The problem was that the ladies of Vung Tau were “rent-a-girls” who
                    would take care of a soldier for the week of his leave and then move on to
                    another and often have no remembrance of the man who had rented her some months
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying there was, in a certain sense, a
                        misconception or a poor communication or poor understanding. The Americans
                        assumed that these women were in terrible difficulty and desperately trying
                        to get out, whereas in actual fact, many of the Vietnamese spouses were not
                        that terribly concerned about not returning to the United States, at least
                        at that point.</hi>

                <p>KENNEDY: Absolutely. It was quite a contrast between Korea, where there was not a
                    war, when I served some years later. So immigration from Vietnam was not as
                    major a problem as were other problems of Americans in trouble, but that's
                    another story.</p>
                <p>One problem that I did have was with Vietnamese orphans whom Americans wanted to
                    adopt. The situation was urgent. Because of the war there were many orphans,
                    often just infants being kept under appalling conditions in hospitals. Americans
                    respond to this sort of crisis and were trying to adopt these children. The
                    problem was that the Vietnamese had a French-based law on adoption. It was a
                    typical European approach to adoption for the time. You had to be of the same
                    race, religion and over 50 in order to adopt a particular child. Of course this
                    ruled out almost all Americans. The only way to get the adoption approved and a
                    visa issued was to get the law waived. The only person who could waive the law
                    was the President of Vietnam, who had other more pressing problems. President
                    Thieu would not delegate this task and so there was quite a bottleneck. From
                    time to time I would send word to the ambassador that we would like some
                    movement on the orphan approval business and reluctantly he would raise the
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, from 1975 on, we began to have large numbers of
                        people leaving. Were there any precursors? Were there any signs that such a
                        thing might happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: No. As I say, the war was going well, and it was only when things
                    started to collapse that everybody tried to get the hell out. There was a
                    general feeling that if the country was to collapse, if the Vietnamese
                    Government would collapse and the North would take over, yes, there would be a
                    tremendous desire to get out. But that just wasn't happening when I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then from Saigon, you went to Athens, where you were
                        consul general from 1970 to 1974. Of course, this was right at the height of
                        the colonels, the fairly repressive regime. I gather by the time you got
                        there, the King had already fled. In what way did consular work and movement
                        of peoples relate to the general problem of Greek-American relations at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oddly enough, very little. We had a great deal of trouble with
                    Americans, particularly Greek-Americans, who came back and would demonstrate
                    against the colonel's regime, Papadopoulos and company. They had a referendum in
                    which the King was deposed. But the Greeks left Greece for economic reasons, and
                    these were almost always the poorer classes. Many of the wealthier Greeks had
                    taken precautions over the years to be sure that they had a safe haven, and they
                    still continue to do it. If they had any claim, they would get themselves a
                    green card and go to the United States as an immigrant, but then often would
                    return to Greece — these are people with money — to continue their business, but
                    just in case trouble came, they could keep the resident alien card in their hip
                    pocket and be able to leave in a hurry.</p>
                <p>As far as any feeling that the Greeks were leaving the country because of
                    political reasons, no. There might have been a few. Some of the better known
                    exiles and all would leave for France or England, and some to the United States
                    would stay as non-immigrants and carry on anti-colonel regime activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see you were an examinations officer for Board of
                        Examiners of the Department of State from '75 to '76. As I understand it, at
                        that time you were the chairman of what was called consular cone. Correct me
                        if I'm wrong, but I believe you were involved in directing the process of
                        selecting consular officers, Foreign Service officers, who were coming into
                        the Foreign Service with the intention of specializing in consular affairs.
                        I gather that this is perhaps continuing what you were doing when you were a
                        personnel assignments officer from '67-'68, which was the beginning of what
                        I would call the upgrading of the consular career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Could you tell us how the process of consular cone officer selection actually
                    proceeded, what was helping you to achieve the objective of getting good
                    officers, and what was hurting you.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: First, I think I'd better explain the term “cone.” It's a horrible term,
                    and somehow I think it has to do with computer data entry. But anyway, it was
                    picked up early in the State. It means, really, the consular specialization. To
                    be clear, anybody entering the Foreign Service since the mid-'70s would enter
                    the Foreign Service as a Foreign Service officer. However, there was an effort
                    to take officers who, before you entered, say, you needed so many administrative
                    officers, you needed so many political officers, forecast the future. “So let's
                    try to get people who will probably stay in these specialties, and try to
                    identify them before we take them on board, with the idea being that most of
                    them will probably be staying in the area to which they were hired, but can move
                    from cone to cone at a latter part of their career if they so choose.”</p>
                <p>So we would examine all officers. I just represented somebody from the consular
                    side, but there would be somebody else from political, USIA, etc., sides. There
                    would be three examiners for each candidate. They were given an oral interview
                    for about an hour or so.</p>
                <p>One of the hardest things was to define what makes a good consular officer. As an
                    experienced chief of section, where I'd run various sections in the Foreign
                    Service and observed young officers, I found that the same qualities that made
                    for a good political officer often made for a good consular officer. Both people
                    deal with the public, that's imperative. Sensitivity to people; you don't have
                    to be a pushover for a story, but you've got to understand the pressures under
                    which other people are working in another culture. An ability to make decisions
                    and explain decisions, but not be pig-headed about them. And a sense of history
                    and understanding of both the history and the culture of the country that you're
                    dealing with. In other words, bright, informed, personable and self-confident
                    young men and women.</p>
                <p>After that, really of less importance is an ability to memorize rules and
                    regulations, because those things come with the job. You learn them on the job.
                    Too often there's a tendency to say that if somebody will make a good lawyer,
                    they'll make a good consular officer. I'd say that probably being a good social
                    worker or a good desk sergeant at a police station would make a better consular
                    officer than somebody who is legally inclined, because it's an art, not a
                    precise law. And this is what I was looking for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a sense that other areas of the Department
                        were still resisting the idea that consular officers were involved
                        mainstream activities, as far as U.S. foreign relations were concerned? And
                        if this is the case, how did that play itself out in, for example,
                        discussions between other members of the Board of Examiner panels?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: To begin with, there's a dirty word in consular lexicon, which is
                    “substantive.” In State Department language, you are a substantive officer if
                    you deal with political or economic events, but you are a non-substantive
                    officer if you are dealing with administrative or consular events. Looking at it
                    purely from the consular viewpoint, if an officer dealing with the protection
                    and welfare of Americans abroad or the selection of future Americans through the
                    emigration process is considered by the State Department and, really officially,
                    because this is a deceptive word and certainly was in the time that I'm talking
                    about, that is a process which is not of the substance of what the State
                    Department is dealing with. And that represents the attitude.</p>
                <p>You see, the consular branch had traditionally been an easy place to put problem
                    personnel. An ambassador has a secretary who's tired of being a secretary; a
                    courier is tried of traveling; a clerk wants to move up from the file room. Now,
                    there's nothing wrong with any of these aspirations, but they're going to put
                    them into consular jobs. Some are extremely qualified and they entered the lower
                    ranks of the Service for one reason or another, and we'd be delighted to have
                    them move up to consular officer positions. But the greater number really
                    weren't qualified and had not the intellectual background or maybe even the
                    intellectual apparatus, or sensitivity to deal with consular problems. But the
                    consular service had always been a handy escape valve for taking people whom you
                    have to take in for political or other reasons.I'll give you two cases in point.
                    What do you do with the wives or sometimes husbands of Foreign Service officers?
                    One very strong recommendation from within the State Department is to turn them
                    into consular officers. Supposedly there will be some screening, but in other
                    words, you wouldn't say, “Turn them into political officers.” Another example is
                    you find — and it's still true today — a disproportionate number of minority
                    officers, who are brought in on special programs, not through the normal
                    examination process, but in programs designed as sort of a catch-up for previous
                    discrimination. You will find they are being put into consular jobs. It is
                    considered a dumping ground, to some extent, I'm afraid, it has been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Seoul in Korea, where you were consul general
                        from 1976 to 1979. What were the types of problems that you faced? One
                        impression I get is that Korea is now a major source of immigration into
                        this country. Did this figure in the period you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. The figure had moved from — I may be somewhat off on this, but say
                    about 7,000 Koreans; 7,000 to 8,000 were getting immigrant visas to the United
                    States in approximately 1970. By 1979, we were issuing over 30,000. It was
                    because as more Koreans get into the United States, more were becoming qualified
                    for immediate relative status, and they brought others in. Also, the Koreans
                    wanted to get out, and their government was encouraging them to. There were a
                    number of ways this was being done. One is just the normal way: somebody
                    (particularly a woman) goes to the United States, marries, and sends for her
                    family.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>With the G.I.s there, both wittingly and unwittingly, the Korean's families that
                    wanted to go to the United States were not averse to using them. We're really
                    talking about not the upper class, but the poor people who wanted to go to the
                    United States and better themselves. In a country where women were treated, if
                    not as cattle, damn close to it, one female member of the family, a sister of a
                    large family, would be designated as the bride. She would go, and it would be
                    arranged. Either a G.I. would be paid off, an American soldier would be paid
                    off, or just by normal attraction — she would go out and meet him, get married,
                    with no real intention of continuing the relationship, or if she did it, it was
                    a begrudging one. So she had obtained American citizenship status within two or
                    three years, and then send for the rest of the family. This was, I've always
                    felt, a perversion of the law, because the idea is to unite families. Well, in
                    the Korean context, when a woman marries, she moves into somebody else's family;
                    she's no longer really in close relation to her brothers and sisters, because
                    they move on. They are not that tightly knit a family, particularly for women,
                    to the rest of the family from which she's born. But using this, there was a lot
                    of what was really, if not illicit, it was almost illicit type immigration.</p>
                <p>Then we had a great deal of fraud. Koreans were willing to pay a great deal of
                    money, and I had about four or five people fired after a big investigation in
                    the consular section because of immigrant visa fraud. This is fraudulent
                    petitions, fraudulent relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were Korean national employees you're talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: These are Korean national employees. I was always worried about our
                    American officers, because I was concerned that they might get too friendly.
                    They'd could be vulnerable to either gifts, sexual favors or the like, because
                    it was that type of society where both sexual favors and gifts were readily
                    offered. I had no knowledge of any problems, but I certainly kept it in mind.
                    With our Korean employees, it was mainly just payoffs. After I left, there has
                    been a sort of revolving scandal. There are always people being fired because of
                    the problem. On the other hand, I have to say that the Koreans make good
                    citizens, hard-working people, and really one of the successes.</p>
                <p>Here I just might mention one of the problems of being a consul general and the
                    head of a consular section, that is dealing with the junior officers, to get
                    them to understand, in a way, the facts of life. Because many of the young
                    officers come out from the academic world and have not been exposed to, let's
                    say, the “cruel world.” They're not used to being lied to, at least for official
                    reasons. Immigrants or perspective immigrants will often lie in order to get
                    that visa and, in a way, fair enough. I think most of us would probably do the
                    same, because it is a major benefit to most foreign families in countries such
                    as Korea and Yugoslavia, to become an American citizen. Yet some of the young
                    officers would just get absolutely indignant, and not only get indignant when
                    they were lied to, but vindictive.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I spent a great deal of my time having to get these officers to understand it's
                    not really that awful. You treat it, you deal with the problem; you don't say,
                    “I understand,” and issue the visa. You may refuse the visa, but you have to
                    keep it in perspective. One of my major jobs, I felt, was to act as a counselor
                    or psychiatrist when a young officer is up against the pressures of immigration
                    and what it does to him or her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the themes that is coming out of a number of things
                        that you have discussed with regard to this theme in your several
                        assignments, is what I would call the training function of the
                        consular-officer-supervisor. One gets the impression that a lot of work is
                        done by supervisors in training, or at any rate, it should be. I wonder if
                        you could expand on that topic a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. I would say it's probably the major function, because when you
                    reach a certain point, you're no longer interviewing prospective immigrants.
                    It's not a bad idea to go in from time to time and test the waters, to keep your
                    hand in. I have to add that I've never found it easy to say “no” to a person.
                    It's not much fun, and it's hard work because of the need to say “no” to a lot
                    of people, insofar as, “No, I can't give you a visa because you, for one reason
                    or another, don't qualify.”</p>
                <p>We have usually two types of officers. One are the regular officers, brand-new,
                    one of their first or second assignments is in the consular section, rather
                    naive about the world and, as I mentioned before, overly indignant if lied to or
                    somebody's trying to put it over on them. The other one is that we still have a
                    good number of officers who are brought in for other reasons. I'm talking about
                    there are still officers who are not as qualified as the bright examination-type
                    officers, the ones who passed the examinations, but the ones brought in for
                    other reasons, minority programs, keeping husbands and wives together, promotion
                    within the clerical ranks, and the like. These officers of the second category
                    can be rather unsure of themselves and stick to the rules and regulations. The
                    visa rules are such that it's quite easy to say “no,” but the thrust of our
                    immigration policy is really to say “yes.” It's very difficult to bring these
                    substandard officers to understand that they have to use their judgment and they
                    have to be able to make reasonable exceptions in order to have a fair visa law,
                    rather than to say “no.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder now if we could go to your assignment as consul
                        general in Seoul from 1976 to 1979. The statistics show that in the 1970s,
                        Korea became a very large source of immigrants to this country. My
                        impression is that that's fairly new. Could you give some indication of what
                        operational problems and policy problems this posed for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. In the first place, you have to look upon immigrant visas coming
                    from some countries, why they grow. There's always the change. The European
                    demand has gone down; the Asian demand has gone up. It takes a while for the
                    people in a country to get their visas. What happened in Korea would be that a
                    G.I. would marry a Korean woman; she eventually would become a citizen; she
                    would, getting her preference as an American citizen, send for her brothers and
                    sisters. When they get to the United States and they become American citizens —
                    it could take five years — then their husbands and wives of these brothers and
                    sisters would then send for their brothers and sisters, also of the family, but
                    it was the brothers and sisters who really drive the figures up. And when they
                    became citizens, they would again send for their brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many officers and employees did you have, and how did
                        you divide their functioning as far as the various consular services were
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'm guessing a little bit as far as the staffing pattern. I had one
                    officer during non-immigrant visas, one officer doing American services,
                    including protection of welfare passports, and about four to five officers doing
                    immigrant visas, and then myself and a deputy. That was more or less the working
                    pattern, and we had maybe 30 Koreans who were divided proportionally about the
                    same, mainly in the immigrant visa process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice you had a deputy. Did you, the way you managed
                        that section, delegate management of the section largely, while you did
                        other things? If that's the way it was, what were the types of things that
                        specifically occupied you as consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I've never held myself to really being a visa expert. I know the law.
                    But I was lucky, I had two deputies, one was Olin Whittemore, and then Sunao
                    Sakamoto, both of whom knew visa work and they knew it well. So I left the
                    day-to-day supervision of those functions to them. I spent more of my time on
                    looking over the major management things. We were trying to automate the system,
                    and we volunteered to be a post to try an early Wang computer, to see if we
                    could automate it, because we had over 100,000 names in our files. I'd say 60%
                    of them, the last names were either Kim, Yang, Park, or Chou. A very difficult
                    problem to sort out who was who. We worked with the computer, but it never quite
                    panned out, because in those days — things have changed so much — the computer
                    capacity was just too small to really handle the information. The other reason
                    was that the thrust of this was not coming out of the visa office, but out of
                    the central — I think it was called ISO — the central computer people in the
                    Department. That meant that we didn't have the full cooperation of the Visa
                    Office. I wasn't aware initially that there was this problem, that we were
                    actually asking for help from the wrong place. The visa office eventually did
                    come up with their own program and duplicated very much what we were trying to
                    do, and did it better.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much fraud in Korea? If so, how did you deal
                        with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: To use a good old American term, “oi ve!” Fraud was the name of the game
                    in Korea. Koreans wanted to go to the United States. We had this peculiar law
                    that disqualified all sorts of people, and the Koreans are very pragmatic
                    people. For example, there was a section of the Immigration Law saying that an
                    unmarried son 21 years of age could receive a high priority to get into the
                    United States, however, if he were married, he couldn't come into the United
                    States for a long time, so they'd divorce. They'd turn around and come in, come
                    back and remarry. People would make up false labor certificates. You really
                    couldn't trust birth certificates. Relationships are very tangled in Korea at
                    the best of circumstances, because often a family would, say, without males,
                    sort of absorb a cousin's male children into their family if they have enough
                    money. That type of thing.</p>
                <p>Then there's just plain outright fraud of families paying a G.I. or someone else
                    to marry a daughter, supposedly, to go to the United States, where she would
                    leave her so-called spouse, but maybe stay long enough to get quick citizenship,
                    three years, then turn around and bring the rest of her family.</p>
                <p>There were ways of getting into the United States if you had the cooperation of
                    the Korean clerks within the visa function. When I was there, we had a major
                    scandal. I was then concerned about what I felt were signs that there was fraud,
                    but I didn't know. I asked the Office of Security to send in a special team,
                    which they did do, and we dismissed about four people. It was the first, I
                    think, really major discovering of fraud in our embassy, but I found out, after
                    I'd been gone for several years, just when I was doing this, a whole new fraud
                    of fake petitions was being started, just when I felt I was cleaning out the
                    shop. I talked to my successors, and it's unending.</p>
                <p>Here I want to tell of an effort on my part to get some control over the
                    documentation process in Korea. The Canadian Consul, Con Adams, and I had
                    discussed the problem that we had with all the “fly-by-night” visa brokers in
                    Seoul. These were operators who would take a prospective visa applicant and do
                    all the necessary work in getting documentation for both visas and passports.
                    there was a legitimate need for this type of work. Getting documents in the
                    complex bureaucracy of Korea was difficult and very time-consuming. It was
                    particularly difficult for American soldiers trying to get everything for their
                    brides. These were usually girls with little knowledge of the way to work within
                    the Korean bureaucracy and it was only natural to hire someone to do it. The
                    problem, as we saw it, was twofold. First, the brokers often charged outrageous
                    sums for their services to Americans; and secondly, they often cooked up
                    documents and fraud was endemic, not only with the G.I. bride visas but with
                    regular Korean visa applicants. The motto of the visa broker was “can do” as far
                    as making anyone eligible for a visa.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>When we would discover a case of visa fraud we would report it to the police and
                    there would be an investigation, but the visa brokers often would pay off the
                    investigators or just close their offices and move down the street and open
                    another with a new name.</p>
                <p>The Canadian Consul, Con Adams, and I approached the Foreign Ministry with a
                    complaint and a proposal, the complaint was about the corruption in the
                    visa/passport process and the proposal was that the Korean Government should
                    somehow get some control over it, that it was embarrassing the Government.
                    Within a few months the Koreans came back with a plan. Essentially it was to
                    make some officially sanctioned visa broker offices. No one could get documents
                    without going through one of the three private offices. Everyone in those
                    offices would be registered so that blame could be assigned in case of fraud.
                    Also a firm set of fees would be published so that the G.I. or the Korean visa
                    applicant would know exactly what he or she had to pay. We insisted that
                    allowance be made for those who wanted to do all the running around for the
                    documents themselves, which a few did, very few.</p>
                <p>This procedure, after some negotiation over particulars, was put into effect. It
                    did not cure the corruption/fraud process, but it did put some brakes on it
                    since we could and did nail people who were caught. No system can work smoothly
                    in a country where payoffs are expected and there is pressure to get certain
                    services, but it did help channel our investigations and to keep the American
                    serviceman from being bilked.</p>
                <p>I should mention here that one problem that we did not have in Korea was with
                    fake students. In many other countries, especially in the Middle East , young
                    men will apply for visas to go to some rinky-dink school of flying, woodcarving
                    or the like. They were really not going to study, but paid a fee to a marginal
                    school for its paper of acceptance in order to get student visas and then go to
                    the United States and work. In Korea the Government would not give
                    undergraduates visas, only graduates and they were going to the top schools,
                    MIT, Cal Tech, Harvard and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you believe that this terminates what we need to talk
                        about as far as Seoul is concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Just one more thing about Seoul. One of the things I had to get across
                    to my young officers, who would often be upset about the pressures and the fraud
                    and all, was that despite it all, despite the fraud, despite the work pressure
                    and all, not to take it too seriously. You tried to do what you could, but the
                    main thing was that the Koreans coming into the United States, for the most
                    part, really turned out to be the most admirable people, hard-working, made good
                    citizens, and so you enforce the law, but at the same time, you had to keep in
                    mind that no matter how they got in, we were probably coming out with a fairly
                    good product.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your last overseas post in your career was consul general
                        in Naples from '79 to '81. I know that at one point, Southern Italy was a
                        major immigration source for the United States. I also have the impression
                        that this was not the case when you were there. Could you discuss that for
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. I think to all of us in the Foreign Service, Naples has always
                    stood as being one of the great immigrant posts, but by the time I arrived
                    there, it had fallen on, you might say, sad days, because having come from
                    Korea, where we were issuing 30,000 immigrant visas a year, I found it somewhat
                    of an anticlimax to come to Naples, where we were issuing less than 2,000, just
                    around 2,000 at the time. The numbers seemed to be decreasing each year.</p>
                <p>The reason for this was that people in Europe were no longer immigrating to the
                    United States in great numbers. The law had changed; it was harder for them to
                    come; the pressures weren't as great; life in Europe was getting much better. In
                    Italy, to be specific, Southern Italy was still a very poor area, but what they
                    were doing was, they were going up to Milan or Turin. They had what they called
                    internal migration. They were going to the north to work in automobile
                    factories. Then they could always come home for Easter, for Christmas, for the
                    holidays. It served them far better than going to the United States. It was a
                    little bit sad to go and look at the big halls of the Consulate General that you
                    knew thronged with people waiting to go to the United States, and to see them
                    almost deserted, except for some nonimmigrants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think another problem that you might have been faced
                        with was third-country visa applicants in Naples. I know, for example, that
                        in 1979, the Iranian revolution happened, and you were there for the first
                        two years of the revolution. Did that impinge in any way on your work? If it
                        did, could you expatiate on some of the problems or issues involved with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: A little bit on the background. Anybody who served in Europe, this is
                    before the Iranian revolution, learned to — the word may be strong, but it's
                    appropriate — detest Iranian students. Iranian students were a set of young men,
                    mostly — I can't think of any women — who would shop around. I know in Belgrade
                    I had them, in Athens I had them. They were everywhere I served. They were
                    looking for ways to get into the United States as so-called students, but once
                    there, they would often get jobs or dig themselves in so they had their green
                    card for one reason or another, and then often go back to Iran, but keeping
                    their American ties, so they could get out of the country any time they wanted.
                    So with that as background, we were very suspicious of Iranian students, because
                    we knew that their student visas really were designed just to get them in,
                    settle in and work.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The Iranian revolution sort of rolled on. It was not a one-shot deal; it went
                    over a few years, while various things were happening. In the United States,
                    there was, and is, a rather large Iranian community that's also very wealthy. So
                    there was a great deal of pressure, particularly in areas of California and New
                    York and all, on Congress to let as many Iranians get into the United States as
                    possible, as refugees, really. The visa law said we had to make sure we were
                    giving them a non-immigrant visa to go to the United States, only for a short
                    period of time and return. How do you give a non-immigrant visa to somebody who
                    is obviously getting the hell out of the country, and with very little chance of
                    his wanting to go back?</p>
                <p>We were getting very peculiar instructions from the Department of State.
                    Obviously a great deal of political pressure was coming from Congress to issue
                    visas to these Iranians: “Don't question them. Give them non-immigrant visas.”
                    At the same time, we all, almost to a man or woman in the consular service, knew
                    that these were refugees, and if you wanted to get them in as refugees, you give
                    them refugee visas. Well, this is before the hostage crisis. The visa office
                    didn't want to get into the refugee business because it wasn't an act of
                    Congress. They could not order us to issue illegal visas, but they sure wanted
                    us to, and they wanted us to in the worst way. They were sending us almost
                    specific instructions to issue the visas, and all over the world, consular
                    officers were saying, “No.” We were turning them down. It was quite a state of
                    affairs.For one thing, we also got very nervous about Iranians, because we
                    didn't want a lot of them around, particularly after the hostages were taken at
                    our embassy. There were stories floating around that the Iranian students were
                    going to try to seize consulates or maybe assassinate us, and given the state of
                    anti-American hysteria in Iran at the time, this was not without some logic. So
                    we just didn't want them in our offices. There was a great deal of conflict in
                    the policy between the posts abroad and the visa office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this particular thing with the consular officers'
                        “revolt,” which we've heard about, did the embassy in Rome basically support
                        what consular officers in the Italian posts were doing? Or were there some
                        people in the embassy, perhaps, who for political reasons wanted the
                        consular officers to do that which the consular officers felt they couldn't
                        do because of law? In other words, were there internal struggles in the
                        American Foreign Service posts overseas, or was the overseas establishment
                        united, if you will, against the Visa Office sending these instructions to
                        the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: From my experience — and I'm only speaking from my viewpoint as consul
                    general in Naples — I think the consular operations overseas were united against
                    the Visa Office in that they were not going to give visas without question to
                    the Iranians. I felt no pressure at all from our embassy in Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>There were some exceptions, and these usually were posts run by relatively junior
                    officers who were getting streams of sort of ambiguous but very pointed
                    instructions from Washington and would give in. I think Switzerland had some
                    officers there who were willing to issue visas rather easily, and the Iranian
                    flood churned toward these posts, they could smell it out faster than we could.
                    So I think this is what happened, but I don't think the embassy was supporting
                    the visa office at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see your next to last assignment in the Foreign Service
                        was a rather interesting and curious one. You were the State Department
                        liaison officer or political advisor to the Commission of the Immigration
                        and Naturalization Service from 1982 to 1984. If my memory serves me
                        correctly, there never was such an assignment before you, nor has there been
                        one since you left in 1984. I think we'd like to know something about that
                        assignment, how it came about, how you were picked, and how it worked and if
                        it worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The answer to how it worked, it didn't. How I was picked was I happened
                    to be a free officer. I came back when it was a time of a surplus of senior
                    officers. By that time, I was at the rank of Minister/ Counselor, and there were
                    only one or two jobs that would be possible for a person of my rank with
                    consular experience, and they were filled. So the problem was what to do with
                    me. Diego Asencio was Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, and had the very
                    valid idea that since the Immigration Service and the consular services worked
                    so closely together on visas, and actually on citizenship matters, that there
                    should be some form of liaison. He talked to the head of INS, Alan Nelson, to
                    accept an exchange of officers. Nelson rather reluctantly, I think, was talked
                    into it. He went along with the idea.</p>
                <p>An INS officer was sent on a three-month tour to the consular affairs office in
                    the State Department, and I went to INS. It never worked. Diego Asencio did
                    involve the Immigration officer in policy considerations and all this. He made a
                    valiant effort. But INS never took me to its bosom. Perhaps it was my fault,
                    that I didn't do the right things or show enough initiative, but I think it was
                    endemic to the situation. The Immigration Service has always been very leery of
                    the State Department; they feel that the State Department is an elite
                    institution with a bunch of swift talking officers who just don't understand the
                    Immigration officer's point of view, and they feel like they're country cousins.
                    So I think they are inclined to deal with us very carefully. There was another
                    problem. Alan Nelson, a very friendly man, but basically his top men were all
                    outsiders. They came from the Reagan Administration. But they were going to run
                    it without much help from INS professionals from within their own organization,
                    so that the actual serving Immigration Officers really had very little say at
                    the time I was there in the high command, and they weren't going to listen to
                    their own professional officers they sure as hell wouldn't listen to a Foreign
                    Service Officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>There just was very, very little cooperation between the State Department and the
                    Immigration Service. One thing in particular, I was trying to get our computers
                    to read their computers. We were trying to get a system so that any person that
                    came into the United States on a non-immigrant visa would have a computer
                    number, sort of a bar code that you could read by computer, by wand, such as
                    they use for library books or in supermarkets. And you'd know exactly where
                    somebody was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like the holography system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, of that system. Each person would get a unique number as they came
                    in. We'd already started this with our passport system, and wanted to develop a
                    system so that we issued a visa and you could track a person all the way
                    through. But INS went their own way, so there was no compatibility and no
                    attempt at compatibility. There were other examples of where we tried to get
                    together.</p>
                <p>After Diego Asencio left in late '83, the life went out of this liaison, and I
                    left shortly thereafter and began to make plans for my retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look back on your consular career now, are there
                        any things that strike you with particular reference to movement of
                        peoples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Looking at it, I feel more comfortable with the law that we have today;
                    I'm talking about 1986. Basically the law had changed in 1967, prior to that
                    there were very stringent quotas on Asians. Most Asian countries were only
                    allowed 100 immigrants; now we're getting thousands from the Philippines,
                    thousands from Korea and India, beginning in China, both beginning to weigh in
                    with their thousands, too. I think we're a better country for it. I feel more
                    comfortable without that blatantly discriminatory policy.</p>
                <p>I do feel that our visa, refugee, the whole movement of peoples laws, though, are
                    administered without really having any knowledge of what do we want. If we have
                    to pick and choose who comes in and who doesn't, which is what we were doing, I
                    would prefer it would not apply just to relatives, but tie to need, people who
                    could do the best in the United States, rather than including brothers and
                    sisters. Our visa laws are still, some of them, unfair in that people who lie or
                    sneak across the border are able to adjust their status in the United States,
                    and get ahead of those who have waited legitimately, maybe for years, for their
                    visa priority number to come up. I liked supervising young FSOs, visa work for
                    them was often a traumatic experience for them, being exposed to the real world,
                    and the school teacher in me enjoyed helping them come to understand how to
                    administer a difficult law with fairness and compassion. I also enjoyed dealing
                    with the visa applicants and trying to help them. I did feel, however, that our
                    immigration policy and procedures are not a very well administered, or well
                    thought out.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying, in effect, that the operational message
                        from the legal and regulatory and procedural matrix of movement of peoples
                        into the United States is governed by the theme “dishonest does pay”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Dishonesty pays, political pressure pays. It's not that it's a horribly
                    corrupt system. There is, obviously, corruption there, dishonesty in the form of
                    corruption. I don't think this is a major one. It's more a matter of laissez
                    faire, “What the hell. If Juan gets in by slipping across the Rio Grande, let's
                    see if we can give him a break.” So in a way, it's an unwillingness to say no or
                    to be tough, rather than absolutely dishonest.</p>
