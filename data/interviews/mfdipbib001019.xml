                <p>DONNA HERSEY SANDIN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 11, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing Donna Sandin in her office in the State
                        Department on Wednesday, July 11th, 1990, and this is the 30th anniversary
                        of Donna's entrance into the Service, 1960, as Assistant Agricultural
                        Attach� — the first woman ever to hold that job in Europe. And maybe that's
                        a good place to start. I know how you got the job because I read all of your
                        material but why don't you just briefly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: In 1960 I started with the Labor Department working on cost of living
                    surveys, and through a quirk I acquired a job in the Department of Agriculture.
                    A co-worker wanted to go into the Peace Corps instead of taking this offer, so
                    she said, “Why don't you go over and apply. This man wants someone to do price
                    review on Public Law 480, commodities in the Department of Agriculture, and work
                    on farm export pricing. So why don't you go over and try for the job?” Which I
                    did, and I just went along peacefully doing my job there for a couple of years
                    until — Orville Freeman was the Secretary of Agriculture, and he appointed
                    Dorothy Jacobson as his Assistant Secretary for International Affairs. And I
                    later found out that she said, “Why are there no women in the Agriculture
                    Attach�'s service?” which was then a small independent service of maybe 70
                    officers, something like that. They said there are only maybe two who are
                    qualified. So out of the blue, they approached me with this idea, and I accepted
                    right away and the next thing I knew I was on my way to The Hague. I never found
                    out who the other person was who might have been qualified. They tried to get
                    quite a lot of press mileage out of this. This was, of course, 1965, and
                    Agriculture did a lot to promote their appointment of a woman in this job.</p>
                <p>That sort of thing wouldn't happen now, but that was one of the things...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you written up in Mademoiselle Magazine? That
                        must have been earlier when you were in San Francisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: No, that was later when I was in Caracas, my second post I believe that
                    was, or sometime between the first and second post that article came out.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>But that was just one of the things I was asked to help do so Agriculture could
                    promote their progressiveness, because Agriculture was an old southern
                    organization. The men were all from the south. When I had to make a business
                    trip to New York — it was in my domestic job before going overseas — one of my
                    bosses said, “Well now, be careful in the subways. There have been riots there.”
                    It was a time of a lot of demonstrations. He almost didn't let me go; he may
                    even have postponed it. This was the attitude. But it didn't bother me at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were young and fearless.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I mean it wouldn't bother me that he took that attitude. So I went
                    anyway. I think I had to talk to the grain exporters. I knew nothing about grain
                    exporting, and my job in The Hague was never going to involve that, but I went
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you mentioned that you only ran into real
                        resistance from one Dutch man you talked to about tobacco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: There was one time I took a visitor around in The Hague, he went to talk
                    to somebody on tobacco, and I noticed the Dutch fellow sat so he didn't even
                    have to keep me in his field of vision while talking to the other man. That's
                    the only time I really noticed it. In general, people seemed to be very
                    welcoming. One of the things that did happen was that I spoke Dutch, I had been
                    given good language instruction. Agriculture was impressed with my aptitude for
                    languages that they had found out through testing. They gave me excellent
                    teachers so I know that helped a lot. But I did a variety of things in The
                    Hague.</p>
                <p>I never knew what subject I was going to be writing on next. I did a lot of
                    reports, answering a lot of questions, letters, checking up on regulations for
                    chewing gum for the Adams Company, and going to see oranges unloaded in
                    Rotterdam. We had a very nice local employee staff. We had very qualified
                    people. So I think one of my obstacles actually was a woman who had been there
                    for a long time — she wasn't a secretary really, well she probably was the
                    secretary in charge of the agricultural Attach�'s office, but she had
                    accumulated a lot of other responsibilities, some reporting, some agriculture
                    intelligence and I think she probably saw me as a threat. I apparently got along
                    with her but afterwards I'm sure she had some things to say. I never looked for
                    problems. Years later I might find that, “Oh, you so offended her when you did
                    this or that.” But I didn't know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said something — was it in The Hague or was it in
                        Caracas later — where you were told not to type because that would
                        immediately...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Oh, that was something. When I took the agriculture job after leaving the
                    Labor Department, the Agricultural job that eventually led to my going overseas,
                    my boss said, “I don't ever want to see you at the typewriter because if these
                    two senior secretaries find out you can type not only will they give you all
                    kinds of typing to do when we really have a crunch of getting some documents
                    out, but they wanted your job. Both of them felt they were capable of doing it.
                    And I said that was a job that could only be done by someone with a university
                    degree, and somebody should be an economist. But they maintained they could do
                    it quite well, and they really wanted to be considered for the job.” So he said,
                    “I don't want you to do anything to diminish your image as a college
                    educated-professional.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really walked right into some office politics, that
                        you had to handle at a very young age.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It was a small office too, maybe 10-15 men, and some secretaries. We had
                    a definite mission to do, and it was an interesting office and people were
                    always doing things. Nobody was sitting around, there were no incompetents just
                    filling chairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been double-edged, that in one way you were a
                        novelty, and they were delighted to have you there. You made good publicity
                        I see from some of the things I've read. But on the other hand, there must
                        have been some of the older entrenched men who took a somewhat dim
                        view...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I'm sure they did. My first boss overseas was very nervous, I realized
                    after I'd already made some goofs. He was very concerned that I not do
                    anything... that I not date the wrong people, that I not act improperly in any
                    way. He filled me in on a lot of the background of diplomatic things that people
                    need to know — how to know who outranks you, and so forth. What to do in
                    presenting calling cards, which I think it was decided I should do, after quite
                    some discussion. They actually had me make formal calls on the embassy wives,
                    like the spouses did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because that was unusual for a woman to be in your
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. They had in The Hague one other woman on the diplomatic list and
                    that helped there. Where I ran into more problems, but then I was prepared for
                    it, was when I went to my next post because there I was going to work for an
                    Hispanic American, and he apparently had lobbied hard to get me not assigned to
                    that job. I didn't know that, of course, until I started looking through the
                    files in an effort to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, the correspondence...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SANDIN: He had sort of polled every other officer in the Embassy before the
                    assignment was final, especially a woman officer, and she'd said, “It wasn't a
                    good idea to send a woman to this job.” And this was funny because our contacts
                    with the Venezuelan government were quite a few women in a lot of high places.
                    Even our main contact in the Ministry of Agriculture was a woman. And why that
                    wouldn't have carried some weight... I had no trouble in Caracas although I
                    wasn't there that long.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately I wasn't mature enough to realize... to figure out how I could have
                    worked better with this man. I got along fine with him, but we really didn't
                    accomplish much. But what I realized later was that he didn't know how to write
                    well in English because Spanish was his original language. Yet he had all the
                    information which I did not have. If I'd gone in and said, “Look, Carlos, what
                    do we want to say? Tell me this, tell me that and I'll write it up and give it
                    back to you and if you like it, fine.” We would have been great partners, and
                    all the reporting would have gotten done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was too proud to ask.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Well, no, it wasn't that. I'm sure he just didn't perceive this. We
                    didn't have enough time, because he was near the end of his tour. I didn't
                    perceive that that was the way to go. And as much experience as I had, later
                    when I was a wife in Bahia, I had some difficulties because I wasn't sure of
                    myself in the wife job as I would have been now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Caracas a minute. I noticed that you kept
                        on working after you were married, but that was just for a short time at the
                        end of the tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: What happened was we had a very short courtship and we got married within
                    a few months of my arrival at post. We got married in March and my husband
                    thought he had at least until the end of the year to go on his Caracas tour. So
                    I said I wanted to keep working, and Agriculture didn't want to lose me either.
                    That position had been vacant before, and they didn't want it vacant again, and
                    also they didn't want to lose me. So the Ambassador had to be consulted to see
                    if I was allowed to work, and he said I could since... (phone interruption)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Caracas and I asked how you kept on working
                        after you were married because that was most unusual at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: The Ambassador said, “Well, since your husband isn't in the same agency,
                    in fact not even in the same building, I don't see why you can't work.” But, of
                    course, the Ambassador could have said no, and in those days that would have
                    been the final word.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Maurice Bernbaum. Anyway, Agriculture said the way they would get around
                    it was that they would have me as a locally hired American citizen, or
                    something. So that's how they got around it.</p>
                <p>There was no lengthy paperwork, everything was taken care of right away, but then
                    I only worked for a few more months because then Bob got assigned to Brazil. So
                    I did work and when my original boss left a new man came, and I took him around
                    to the different officials. I really didn't accomplish much but as I said, I was
                    only there for about eight months in that post. The Venezuelan government was
                    having elections that year so they were inaugurating a lot of new farm projects,
                    so they were glad to trot us out to look at the ribbon cuttings, and to have me
                    go along. I did nicely there, but I really didn't do much reporting, or much
                    agricultural intelligence. I don't know how things could have gone... I
                    certainly wasn't as effective as I was in The Hague. But then we didn't have all
                    the local employees we had in The Hague either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Dutch FSNs (Foreign Service Nationals) are
                        extraordinary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: The Dutch are organized. With their statistics you can get almost
                    anything you want in the way of information. Of course, the businessmen are
                    experienced businessmen, they aren't going to tell you things they don't want
                    you to know but some was intelligence work and I just don't know where we would
                    have started in Venezuela to get the information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then when you got to Bahia there was no question of
                        working because there was no Agriculture office at the consulate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: No, there was no Agriculture. Perhaps if we'd gone to Rio, which was
                    still the Embassy, they would have loved to have hired me but I didn't know any
                    Portuguese — well, I knew Spanish. I just don't think I would have done it. I
                    wasn't that keen to continue. I just sort of knew I would give it up eventually.
                    It didn't bother me to give it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me. You said you had troubles adjusting as a spouse
                        in Bahia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Oh, well, we had a very small post. There was another woman officer...
                    see, the troubles were with women... a very aggressive single woman officer in
                    the same agency as my husband, and she had some contacts in Brazil. She had
                    taught English to a lot of people who had been in high positions in government,
                    and she believed she knew how to entertain. She didn't like the way I
                    entertained. She didn't like the fact that I didn't entertain very much. And I
                    could have easily answered her back. She wanted my husband to do more contact
                    work. She under ranked us, so I wasn't worried about this. But I should have
                    been, because later she really torpedoed his whole performance report and
                    everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your husband outranked her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: He outranked her but she was always around the inspectors when they came
                    through, and she would damn us with faint praise, is what it was. She was an
                    expert at that. I should have known how to deal with her, and nowadays I would
                    know how to deal with her, and she would have just kept quiet, and I would have
                    probably inspired her respect in some ways. But I didn't know how to entertain.
                    My husband is also a shy person, he's not that great on contact work. I
                    entertain successfully enough, but not to her standards, and she felt that
                    entertaining was a great deal of our job. We had a new baby but, of course, we
                    had servants so that was no excuse. The Consul's wife also was a kind of flashy
                    entertainer. I mean, their act there is still hard to follow 20 years later. So
                    you can see we were between two people who really made a social splash. And in
                    the third year we were there things by then went a lot better because by then I
                    had my little role, we had our own little spheres where we all were successful.
                    In retrospect I realize it would have been great if I had the self confidence
                    that I only gained years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I think in retrospect too that you entertain best in a
                        manner in which you are comfortable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. Of course, this particular woman didn't have any regard for my
                    distinguished background. I probably didn't bring it up enough. Nowadays you
                    would. Because after all, I retired at a GS-13.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's exactly what you should have done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: By then I was totally in the wife role. I'd completely put my past
                    success behind me, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you stayed in... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SANDIN: We stayed in Bahia for three or four years, then we came here. Then we
                    went to Montevideo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you were back here you were just taking care of
                        one child or two children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: When I was back here I took care of one child. Then I had another child.
                    I did some freelance writing for a contractor who had a contract with Commerce.
                    So I was working out of my home when I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you live then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: We lived in Arlington. My husband was really helpful. As soon as he came
                    home, after dinner he would do the dishes and I would go up and write. The kids
                    were little so I could write during their naps, and later I did send them out
                    once or twice a week to a babysitter. But I had just answered an ad in the
                    newspaper that my husband had found for me, in fact. I found a nice writing job
                    where they liked my work. I could do it all at home. All I had to do was drive
                    to Rockville every now and then to deliver their stuff. So it was ideal. And
                    again I found... all the jobs that I've found have been by chance, really,
                    starting with the Agricultural job. A girl on the desk near me in the Department
                    of Labor knew that I was interested in leaving the Department of Labor after
                    traveling for them for two years. Coming to the home office in Washington, the
                    job was kind of dull, so she suggested me for Agriculture, and I immediately got
                    hired. It's all serendipitous really because in Montevideo we had a nice post
                    there, and I didn't work right away but I did get interested in the commissary
                    that was undergoing a sort of overhaul, and I dived right in and determined what
                    products were selling and which weren't, and did a lot of work on that. And some
                    of my actions resulted in the firing of one of the managers so then, of course,
                    everybody wanted me to be the manager but the DCM said, “No way. You helped get
                    her fired so you can't take over the job.” Luckily for me, the woman took the
                    job but the couple was transferred away after a decent interval and then I got
                    the job, which was the most fun job I ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that in Bahia you were a spouse before the 1972
                        Directive, and you came back to Washington just in the midst of the feminist
                        movement — '72 to '75. And then you went to Montevideo again after the '72
                        Directive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder did that make any difference in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SANDIN: I wasn't aware that my performance as a wife was even being evaluated
                    when we were in Bahia. I guess I knew that it could be, but I wasn't at all
                    worried that I was not doing a good job, and I didn't have anybody asking me to
                    do things which they couldn't ask you to do after '72. We didn't have any of
                    that, that problem didn't exist, partly because you had so many servants. And
                    perhaps because the person who was doing the most entertaining relied on her
                    private industry friends — third country people. Her buddy used to help her and
                    she didn't regard me as a buddy, or anybody who would be an asset, I think. So
                    in terms of entertaining, she didn't think I would be any good so that's
                    probably why she didn't lean on me. And after '72 I read about it and so forth
                    but it never had really affected me and by the time I got to Montevideo it was
                    sort of all in place. Of course, my reaction to it was that it was too bad, I
                    felt I would rather be rated. I would rather have some role to play. I had heard
                    of terrible abuses — people who outranked others asking them to do all kinds of
                    stupid things you wouldn't want to do. But I definitely felt that people should
                    have something to do and be asked to participate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's interesting that you who had had your own
                        career would have liked to be included in your husband's...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes, definitely. I definitely felt we were all in the same cause, and
                    were working for it, and people who didn't have enough to do were usually not
                    happy at the post. I mean, you would think the American woman when she goes
                    overseas and has servants and so forth would be happy. But my observation of
                    private industry women in Sao Paulo and other places, is that that is not always
                    the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's partly because they don't know how to manage a
                        household.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It's tough managing a household, and the things they might like to do,
                    they don't have the language to do with. In many countries you can't get far
                    without the native language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, the resources may not be available for
                        what they're interested in doing too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: That too, but where people would say, “Well, I don't want to make
                    brownies, or something...” Why don't they make brownies? They don't have
                    anything else to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's exactly what my husband always said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: But you see this time and time again.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He said, “What would you have been doing in Sierra Leone
                        if you hadn't been a part of the Embassy in that manner?” And he's right to
                        a certain extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Of course. What is nice now is that there's more effort to employ the
                    spouses in the embassies. This I think is really good because it gives people a
                    knowledge of what's going on in the community. And also, I think, in many posts
                    the wife entertained, did a lot of representation — at whatever level you were,
                    you used to do a lot of representation. I think there's less of that now.
                    Certainly if you go to a big city like Sao Paulo you might as well be in New
                    York as far as social life. Except for the Consul General, it's not a big
                    factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of that might be because there is so much else to do
                        there that you're not thrown on each others resources for what you're going
                        to do on the weekend.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Well, it's like I used to say, everybody scatters after work in
                    Washington, and at some of these big posts they tend to scatter too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The women need things to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: They need something to do, so if they're working in the embassies and the
                    consulates then they're constantly aware of the mission, and that helps them
                    represent the country better. And also my own daughter benefitted from the youth
                    summer employment program. She had a wonderful time when she was a rising eighth
                    grader, and quite bilingual, by answering the phones during the lunch hour, and
                    helping to deliver the mail around the Consulate. She loved that. She didn't
                    mind at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Sao Paulo just about the same time we were in
                        Recife so you were there with the Arnolds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. Terry Arnold was succeeded by Jack Leary, and the Ambassador when
                    we got there was Sayre, and he was succeeded by Tony Motley, and we left about
                    the time the Motleys left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Montevideo you were involved with the commissary. You
                        said that was a lot of fun. Of course, that was just your field really —
                        products and commodities.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SANDIN: It was fun just knowing people — you had to decide how many cans of
                    tomato soup can you sell versus how many cans of mushroom soup. And you had to
                    know well ahead because you had to order so far ahead. And I tried to order
                    things... I knew people would like the American lunch boxes. The American lunch
                    boxes were expensive but I knew we had enough kids to sell a case of 15 of them.
                    And people really appreciated the little efforts I made to order this or that,
                    something different — I'd always have something different. I had to survey the
                    cigarette smokers to find out what kind of low tars were coming in they might
                    like, but nobody knew because nobody had been around. So I found an article in
                    the Wall Street Journal that said what the best selling brands were, and I
                    ordered those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in your field. It must have been great fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It was a lot of fun. Then I got a better offer I couldn't refuse. I was
                    on the beach one day in Montevideo and I walked up to a woman who looked
                    American — or maybe she was even speaking English to her child — and we talked,
                    and within a few weeks she asked me if I ever did translating. I said I never
                    had, but I'd done a lot of writing. And she said, “My husband is in charge of
                    the International Labor Organization office here in Montevideo and he really
                    needs another assistant to work on projects, and to do some translating.” She
                    said, “I would be perfect for it, but I'm his wife so I'm not allowed to be
                    employed by him, so why don't you go?” And I worked for about year there, and
                    that's how I got into translating — just a chance encounter on the beach. So I
                    had to give up the commissary to this other, although they were both part time.
                    Had I not had children, and had a better maid situation — the maids were always
                    failing to come back from their weekends — I probably could have done them both.
                    I hated to give up the commissary but this other proved to be my ticket into
                    translating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask — you must really have a great language
                        ability because you learned Portuguese in Portugal, and Spanish in
                        Caracas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I had some courses in Spanish but I didn't have much formal education in
                    Portuguese. And I didn't know that I had any talent for languages. When I was in
                    college I just got by — had qualified in French from high school, which was all
                    that was taught in our high school, French and Latin. So, forget languages was
                    my policy. So I didn't know until I started studying languages to speak them
                    that I apparently had some aptitude. I don't have a good accent, but I learn the
                    language quickly.</p>
                <p>My father came down to visit us in Sao Paulo, which is a pretty advanced place.
                    As far as hardships, there aren't any really. Even so, he said, “It's just
                    amazing the things you just accept.” And I didn't think I was a very accepting
                    person, as soon as something breaks down at home, I want it fixed — I'm going to
                    arrange for it to be fixed. And when the water would fail in Bahia, I used to
                    get kind of exercised about it...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't much you could do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: You couldn't do anything about it, but as soon as I determined there
                    wasn't anything I could do, fine. But if there was anything I could do I would
                    try to do it. But there's something that happens when you know you're going to a
                    foreign culture, and you know you're going to be there. You tend to go out and
                    learn quickly how things are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you have a tendency to go along with the way things
                        were there because there was no point in getting all exercised when there
                        was no water in Recife, for instance. Because it would come back on
                        eventually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: If you knew you were going to go home every year like the private
                    industry people do, I really don't think they settle in as much. They think of
                    themselves as spending nine months... and they really don't learn the road
                    signs, and things like that right away. I remember in The Hague thinking, “Well,
                    I've got to remember this, this means that, and I'm going to need to know this.”
                    If you were a tourist, you could get by without this information, and if you're
                    going for a very short term, I think you think of yourself as a tourist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Sao Paulo? Did you do any translating
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Oh, in Sao Paulo I ran up against this new business of foreign
                    governments are supposed to allow spouses of diplomats to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it's the same thing Beth High was going through at the
                        same time [Beth High, spouse of the Deputy Chief of Mission in Brasilia,
                        worked as a full time volunteer therapist for several years during her tour
                        in Brazil. The Brazilian officials granted her a work permit about six weeks
                        before the Highs were transferred].</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. It was the same time, we were going through the same thing. I was
                    there in Sao Paulo a few months, and I thought I should be doing some freelance
                    translating. So I trotted down to the American Chamber of Commerce. They told me
                    they couldn't put an ad in their newsletter because I was only looking for part
                    time work and the ads were all for full time work. But they said, “Go over to
                    this law firm. They've been after us for quite a while. They want a native
                    American or British to do translating there.” So I walked in and I took their
                    test, and they loved me, and so forth. And I said, “Look, there is a procedure
                    in place. I'm sure I can get my work permit.” So they hired me — this is a high
                    powered law firm, if they couldn't get it for me, nobody could. I didn't get
                    anywhere with the visa thing, and I think the reason the Brazilian government
                    used, which might have been true now that I know a lot about Brazilian labor law
                    — they could not prove that I had the educational background to be a translator.
                    I had never studied translation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that gave them an out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: That gave them an out. The fact that the law firm wanted me was not
                    enough. I really didn't have the professional qualifications on paper. So that
                    was the out they used. But the owner of the firm said, “Oh, well, we're still
                    going to keep you.” He paid me cash out of his pocket every month. Somebody else
                    pointed out to me much later, and I didn't realize, he was undoubtedly paying
                    income tax on it before he had to give it to me! I stayed with them for almost
                    four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably worth it to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: He was very keen on me, and I proved to be enthusiastic, and all those
                    good things. So I worked half days and we really worked hard there. We put out a
                    lot of translating work, so I learned to work fast, and also to work accurately,
                    and I learned a lot about Brazilian law.</p>
                <p>So that's the basis for my career today which I continually thank this nice
                    gentleman for. In fact, I was there in April and thanked him again. I said,
                    “Thanks for giving me the chance.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fantastic. So you're working and your husband is
                        retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. Now I'm working three days a week here. I was lucky again, only by
                    chance when I was doing contract translating for State, just by chance they
                    found out that I was willing to work here in the Department, but I wasn't
                    willing to work full time. At that point they were willing to hire somebody for
                    just three days a week. Now they probably wouldn't do it. But I got in and they
                    even urged me to take this test from Spanish. They give tests here, I had to
                    take the Portuguese to English. It was hard and I thought I failed it but it
                    turned out I apparently passed with flying colors, But nobody remembered to tell
                    me for about four weeks. Everybody thought everybody else had told me. Then they
                    urged me to take the Spanish. I didn't know that they had in the back of their
                    mind offering me a job, But you have to know two languages to be hired, so I had
                    to take the Spanish. And then they hired me for three days a week, But I keep up
                    a freelance business too because I didn't want to come downtown five days a
                    week. I still have one kid at home. So again, I have the best of both worlds,
                    and it came about by being in the right place at the right time. So I feel very
                    lucky, I really do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're being modest because I think it's your
                        qualifications too, and your ability has a great deal to do with it. [Is]
                        your husband working at all, or is he a support system for you now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: He's a support system during the week, and on the weekends he works for
                    USIA in the press file that they send out — any breaking news stories they send
                    out to the foreign posts during the weekend because they found out that
                    newspapers overseas want these stories seven days a week. So they hired three or
                    four retired officers to do this. So it's ideal for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's keeping his hand in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: He's keeping his hand in and during the week he's doing a lot of the
                    errand running, and dish washing and stuff because I do put in quite a few hours
                    a week on freelance work too. Well, here we are both older than we should be for
                    putting kids through college. We should be saving our money for our retirement,
                    or being out on the golf course by now. But since we got a late start we have to
                    finance the kids through their expensive years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're helping do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: So that means that I accept whatever assignments I can get. Whenever I
                    get in translation, I never turn anything down, and fit it in somehow and the
                    other stuff somehow goes along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's nice that he's willing to do the support system,
                        otherwise it would be an awful burden for you, wouldn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes, it would be because I like to have a clean house, and I like to have
                    the laundry done regularly, that sort of thing, and things fixed, and going to
                    the dry cleaning, the bank and post office. So I would be very much under
                    pressure — I couldn't say, “To heck with the house. I'm going up to my little
                    ivory tower.” So I would really be pushed if it weren't for him. He's always
                    been very supportive of everything I did. He was always very proud of the jobs I
                    had in Caracas, and anything else. So he's always been supportive, which is
                    good. I guess a lot of people don't have that. He wouldn't have minded if we'd
                    been a tandem couple at all, had that existed at that time. The other thing that
                    worked against my wanting to continue working, I think, after I got married was
                    that by then I was already probably 29 or 30, and if we were going to have
                    children, I didn't want to be spreading myself too thin. I always found
                    something to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say, you always found something to do
                        with the children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: In Bahia I worked for an American Society which was getting organized.
                    Shopping was the big effort there. I mean life in Bahia required — as you
                    remember from Recife — if you wanted to go shopping you had to go to every store
                    to fill out your whole list because there are always shortages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I used to take a Danish friend of mine — we had a lot of third country
                    people there, it was a nice community — we used to go to fashion shows which was
                    the thing to go to, and we did some charity work in connection with UNITAS, the
                    joint Brazilian/U.S. Navy fleet visits. We distributed basketballs to
                    orphanages, and tickets to the Holiday on Ice — we filled the stadium with kids
                    from different orphanages. And there again, knowing the language was a big
                    factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to ask you if you did any traditional
                        spouse things, and you just told me that you did in Bahia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I did in Bahia. And in Montevideo I did in the sense that I was involved
                    in the commissary. But by then I guess there weren't as many of these hail and
                    farewell parties which in the old days took up a lot of time and which were very
                    valuable. So as I remember it, I don't think we had as close a community as I
                    remember The Hague. The Hague community was wonderful, The Hague embassy people
                    were great. It was very nicely closely knit, and that was because every section
                    made an effort to get to know everybody else. Anybody new, at whatever level,
                    was invited and given many chances.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a nice size embassy. It's not too large.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It was, and it's probably the same size now. In Uruguay the embassy was a
                    nice size too but for some reason I don't remember there being the sense of
                    community quite that there was in The Hague. But it could be because of the
                    passage of time, and I definitely think there weren't very many of these
                    welcoming parties, and goodbye parties like mission-wide parties for whoever was
                    new that month. They weren't doing that in Montevideo, and I think...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's universal because we went back to Rotterdam
                        — we were Rotterdam in 1958 for two years then we went back in '73 and we
                        were there from September until December before anyone invited us to
                        dinner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It's just the way things have gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I didn't really think anything of it because... I
                        picked up the phone after 15 years and called Dutch friends. You couldn't do
                        that in every country but in Holland you could. And yes, we'd arrange a
                        bridge game, or something. So it really didn't make an impression on me — as
                        big an impression as it would have if I had been there without knowing
                        anyone, and knowing my way around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: All you need to spoil this whole system that used to exist is to have one
                    or two section wives who won't go along with it. I'm willing to even meet people
                    at the airport — I understand there are people not even being met at the
                    airport, even in some smaller posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's something a CLO can do now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I think the CLO is a great help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the CLO has institutionalized what we used to do as
                        volunteers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Right. And it just makes sure that its somebody's job to do it, so it
                    definitely is going to get done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That works two ways too. Because the CLO is being paid to
                        do it, there are wives that won't do it as volunteers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's good that it's institutionalized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It's really important to get the new people; to guide them through those
                    first weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I think that makes a difference in their
                        attitude.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Because otherwise if they get jaundiced about the whole place, it doesn't
                    work so well. And then you know everybody and feel a part of the community. I'm
                    not very skilled at interpersonal relations by any means, But I can see that
                    makes a big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't say that. You keep telling me that, and I keep
                        looking for signs of it, and don't see it. I think you're just very
                        modest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I have a friend in one post — she has hardly gone over to the embassy at
                    all, and I thought, “Gee, how could you be there a couple of months and hardly

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: And she was somebody I shared a career with in the early days. Oh, that
                    was funny. Somebody who met us both, a young woman of a tandem couple was
                    talking to us both...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Recently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Recently. And she was amazed to find out that we'd been co-workers in the
                    Labor Department years ago. She couldn't believe... she knew my friend better
                    than she knew me, But she just didn't realize that there would be some women who
                    are not working now, But who in the past, had had a career. She was quite
                    impressed that we still kept up with each other, that this particular woman was
                    an economist. She had had no idea this woman was an economist, and I suppose she
                    thought, “Why the heck did she give it up?” But in those days you did. So the
                    younger woman, I think, was quite impressed with this. I mean it raised my
                    friend a few notches in the young woman's eyes. It was funny to realize that
                    much time has passed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that in your early years you were so
                        interested in what you were doing, and so well qualified and everything,
                        that you really sort of breezed through, not totally aware of all of the
                        little resentments, and office politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I sure wasn't aware of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't affect you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I wasn't looking for it. I guess I was naive and thought that everybody
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that must have been so refreshing to the people you
                        worked with really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: They once or twice had a sharp word for me. I was too defensive when the
                    subjects would come up, I guess they thought I was too defensive, to eager to
                    say “We did this because...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just that you had all the information and you
                        wanted to transmit it to them, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I just wasn't looking for the politics because in my first job — when I
                    first started with the Labor Department, I really don't think there was a lot of
                    politics. We were all involved in one project, and we were all being sent to
                    different places, and I was just so impressed when I first came to Washington
                    with people talking about what I considered were important issues, and really
                    doing something. I wasn't aware they probably were also trying to jockey for
                    higher positions. And even now I hear from people about cutthroat competition
                    among officers, and I didn't see it. I remember in Montevideo one of the
                    secretaries was telling me that, and she thought it was terrible. And then I did
                    later see what was happening to a couple of people that I thought were probably
                    good officers. I did see the effect of politics happening but I never have been
                    one to look for that. So it's fortunate that I didn't. I think I went out of my
                    way to look for things to do in Holland. There were things to attend and I
                    attended them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about filling in at the Ambassador's dinner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Oh, that's right. I forgot. I'm glad you mentioned it. Oh, it was
                    awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you said you had no car and couldn't get in.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SANDIN: There was a new language course, it's a total immersion type course and
                    they thought I'd be a good candidate to try this course out on, to use it on
                    future officers. So I went out to a beach resort, not too far from The Hague —
                    unfortunately during a very rainy summer — and I was in this course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Noordwijk aan Zee, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Noordwijk, yes. I was in a class with a few Turks, and a few Canadians,
                    and a French or two, and I came back to the embassy one day to check the mail or
                    something. (End of Tape 1, Side A)</p>
                <p>William Tyler was the Ambassador to Holland then, he hadn't been there too long,
                    I think he was an appointee of Kennedy and had worked in some high position in
                    the State Department before, so he was a career Ambassador. He called on me, and
                    said, “En principe,” (which I didn't know what that meant) “would you be able to
                    come to dinner at the residence next week?” And I didn't answer right away... I
                    said, “Gee, I guess so, But I'm out at Noordwijk, I don't have any way of
                    getting in to the city.” “Oh, we'll send a car for you.” And I realized much,
                    much later that when the Ambassador says “come” you say, “Of course, sir,” and
                    you work out your own arrangements afterwards, But of course I didn't
                    realize...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I love your naivete. It's wonderful, it works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: He didn't take offense. I'm sure he knew... and it was perfectly true
                    that I didn't know how I was going to get in from out there. I was supposed to
                    be immersed in this course, and I wasn't counting on coming back to The Hague.
                    But the dinner itself was extremely formal and luckily I'd been raised in
                    reasonably cultured surroundings, I knew what fork to use and so forth. But I
                    was just nervous, and Mrs. Tyler was extremely formal. She was more British than
                    American, in fact, I think she was British, and I think she owned vineyards in
                    France, and so did he. It was definitely old-line, and it was a small group.
                    After we got up from the dinner table she said, “Shall we retire,” or something
                    like that. She meant go into the living room and leave the men to themselves. I
                    thought she wanted to know if anybody wanted to use the rest room or something.
                    But I guess I followed suit. I knew enough not to sit on the right hand end of
                    the sofa, that I did know. Then I think at one point I spilled a little cognac
                    on this dress I was wearing because my hand was shaking. I suppose people
                    noticed but nobody commented on it, of course. Other than that I probably got
                    through it pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I know there are a lot of delightful Ambassadors' wives, and some real American
                    types. Well, I didn't have any; they were almost always foreigners with a
                    different background. I can see why each Ambassador's wife would be a challenge
                    to every officer, because in Mrs. Tyler's case she probably was only liked by
                    the women who were European, and there were a lot of wives who were European.
                    She just probably thought Americans were too informal. In Caracas, Mrs. Bernbaum
                    had a habit of knitting at every public ceremony she went to with her husband. I
                    guess the Latins didn't care much for that but her attitude was, so what. And
                    Mrs. Siracusa, in Montevideo — I had these beautiful earrings — she asked in a
                    reception line if they were really IUDs! She thought that I had earrings made of
                    IUDs, to be a feminist, I guess, or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a reception line she asked you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes! I don't think there were any local officials there, perhaps it might
                    have been just women coming over for coffee. I don't remember the occasion. I
                    mean she would say... she was outspoken in all kinds of ways. I was just as glad
                    I didn't have to deal with some of these people on a close daily basis. She was
                    really only there at the beginning of the tour. And we had the U.S. Bicentennial
                    in Montevideo — and we had quite a bit of community cohesiveness.</p>
                <p>In the Netherlands, going back to that, I got through that first dinner. The
                    other woman on the diplomatic list was the Labor Attach�, an older woman, and
                    she, I guess, was included in quite a few things. But another time somebody came
                    from the State Department, he was a Deputy Assistant Secretary, or an Under
                    Secretary for something, and for some reason they were going to discuss the
                    future of Indonesia which was pretty pertinent in 1965, and they had a dinner in
                    the upstairs room of the Des Indes, a hotel restaurant. And for some reason the
                    Dutch officials were bringing their wives so this official from the State
                    Department needed to have a female companion to match up the tables, so I went.
                    I really enjoyed it because they were discussing some of the things at the table
                    which were real policy, and I thought, “All these people are really getting
                    somewhere, and they're going to accomplish something, they're saying intelligent
                    things.” I guess lots of it took place when the women had left — you know, the
                    women and men separate after dinner and the men smoke cigars, and women talk. So
                    a lot of it took place then. But the occasion was a high point. But by then I
                    wasn't nervous about this at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been through it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: And I knew the language, and I knew my way around. But that was a good
                    point about being a woman on the diplomatic list. Now when you don't have to
                    match up tables anymore, that probably isn't an advantage. There were things
                    that you had to go to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: And I wasn't trying to compete.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I have to give credit — my boss in The Hague was really great. Lou Smith
                    and his wife were always very good to every newcomer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that L-O-U, or L-E-W?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: L-O-U — Louis M. Smith, Jr. His wife's name was Sue. They retired to
                    North Carolina. I suppose he might even be deceased now. I often thought I
                    should write to him after all these years. Anyway, they were delightful people.
                    And the other Assistant Agriculture Attach� was a single man from Texas, which I
                    guess gave some people a chance to wonder — you know, single officers, one man,
                    one female. Why didn't they get together, or something? But he was a confirmed
                    bachelor. There were several single people in The Hague, and we all went touring
                    together and that was another thing that helped because that was a bad place for
                    single persons. It was what they call a family post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: So there were three or four single people, one of whom I'm still in
                    correspondence with. And I had very good Dutch neighbors, they sort of took me
                    under their wing, an older couple. So a lot of things I learned about Dutch
                    culture, I learned from them. But I did have an unfortunate time early in my
                    stay there when I dated a local employee in the Embassy. That was frowned on. No
                    one ever told me it would be, you know. A clerk from Budget &amp; Fiscal, a nice
                    looking Dutch fellow — not younger than I am or anything but that was a... Then
                    he thought we could still date if he wasn't working at the embassy anymore. So
                    he left the embassy. He was real upset when I said we couldn't continue
                    dating.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you told by the embassy?</hi>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: My boss definitely wanted me to meet my future husband. I think he
                    thought he might even get rid of me that way.</p>

                <p>SANDIN: Actually I think it was to make sure I had somebody to go out with
                    probably. But he didn't tell me the fellow was single. I still remember when we
                    had lunch together thinking that my future husband was not single, we were just
                    going out to lunch...</p>

                    in Mexico and he almost married a Mexican girl but after that he decided he was
                    going to be in the Foreign Service he shouldn't marry a foreigner. For some
                    reason he really wanted to marry another American, But I guess he just hadn't
                    met...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he was always overseas and there weren't women
                        officers abroad in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I guess he thought it was better to marry an American than to try to
                    bring a foreigner into the American Foreign Service.</p>

                    look it, and he'd never been married so his family was glad to see him get
                    married. My family was probably glad to see me get married in those days.</p>

                        out as a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate. How exciting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes. It's Blueprints For Memory. He's been teaching memory by association
                    in memory systems as a hobby, as an avocation for many years. He's traveled a
                    lot, he's given courses to civil servants. He even gave a course in Brazil when
                    I went down there to see him. He wrote a book about improving your memory about
                    20 years ago, But this is a much better book. My mother did a lot of the
                    editing, and that's one reason it's a better book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me know when it comes out because I could use
                        it, believe me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: It's a thin book fortunately, and its got a lot of tricks for memory
                    including a number code for memory, real systems for memorizing specific
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's something that the OBC might be interested in
                        because we need to remember faces, and names especially in a foreign
                        language. I always found it harder to remember — harder to remember what I
                        read in the newspapers in French, or Dutch, or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Oh, it is, and of course the foreigners don't introduce themselves well
                    like Americans do. They mumble their names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or no name at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: They mumble their last names, if anything. While the memory experts tell
                    you to confirm it by repeating it yourself, or saying...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then immediately associating...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Yes, just doing that leaves it in your mind better. I don't know how you
                    can always do that. And it's possible when they say the name you won't get it
                    anyway.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've always thought that living in Sri Lanka, would have
                        been something else again with all of those difficult names — seemingly
                        difficult because I don't know anything about them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I see these lists of officials that the government puts out; lists of
                    officials in different countries, I wonder how people ever manage. The Muslim
                    names, for example.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: My kids enjoyed the Foreign Service. My theory with that is to take the
                    kids out early into the Foreign Service but once you come back to the States if
                    they're in junior high or high school, you almost can't go out again. If you
                    take them out early, and keep them in foreign schools — the American schools
                    overseas — they'll accept that as normal and they'll be happy in it. But if you
                    bring them back and throw them into all the American activities they have never
                    been in before, then it's going to be hard to take them out again. And yet you
                    find people worrying about, “Will my child do well in the first grade if she
                    doesn't go to school in America for her first grade?” I say, “To heck with it,
                    send them to the first grade, bring them back for the eighth and upward.” That's
                    when they really need it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: Take them while they're little, go because you have built-in babysitters
                    and everything like that. Don't worry about whether they get general science and
                    a gifted level fourth grade or not. My daughter keeps that poem that was
                    published quite a few times in the State Department magazine about Sears, and
                    Penney's clothing, versus the designer clothing. Something about new children in
                    the American schools overseas. She said that's so true, because I guess she went
                    to school with a lot of kids of private industry parents who go back every year
                    and bring back all the Jordache and Reeboks and we have everything from the
                    Sears catalogue, or the Penney's catalogue.</p>
                <p>Which is another aspect of the experience in Sao Paulo where there is an
                    excellent school. My kids were classmates of people they wouldn't meet in the
                    States necessarily — children of high-ranking officials of General Motors and
                    that sort of thing. So that was an introduction to another aspect of American
                    life that she might not necessarily get — whatever that might be worth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of my friends who is in Sao Paulo said that you can
                        always tell a Foreign Service wife — she has real jewelry and homemade
                        clothes. So that's the equivalent of the children with their Sears and
                        Penny's.</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SANDIN: Some people don't know how to dress. When we came back on a cruise ship
                    to Sao Paulo, there were some Americans on the cruise ship who weren't sure I
                    was American because of the way I was dressed although I bought all my clothes
                    in the U.S. Because my daughter and I immediately learned what kind of clothes
                    looked too American in Latin America, and we just didn't buy them. I couldn't
                    believe that a high ranking wife in the Sao Paulo community would wear a cotton
                    bathing suit with blue and white checks with “little-boy-shorts” legs. I never
                    wore a bikini but I tried to wear stylish one-piece suits. A lot of people, I
                    thought, just didn't make any allowances for what foreigners expect a well
                    dressed person to wear. Part of this is our American practicality. If the dress
                    is still good, why not wear it. We say “Certainly this pocketbook was bought 15
                    years ago but I still like it and it may be way out of style, But it's a good
                    pocketbook. You can't just throw it away and get another one.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of that may be defiance of a culture they couldn't
                        quite accept.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: That could be. I think a lot of it was they just weren't going to be
                    foolish and follow fashion, But people we're dealing with in other countries do
                    follow fashion. This doesn't mean you have to get everything new, But you should
                    really look at your wardrobe with a jaundiced eye and say, “That is too
                    American.” “That is too much unlike what other people are wearing.”</p>
                <p>I've tried to include in some newcomers guides I might have written, or some Post
                    Reports, I've tried to explain that American men's sport coats are just never
                    seen in Latin America, maybe the blazers, But certainly not the plaids and not
                    the green pants, and the rust colored pants and that sort of thing. And certain
                    other things, American shirtwaist dresses never used to be seen, no peter Pan
                    collars, no basket handbags. We became very aware of it. I hardly buy any
                    clothes overseas. But we'd go through the American stores and say, “No, that's
                    too American, that's too American,” and we wouldn't buy it, we'd select
                    something else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I had to walk through Sao Paulo center every day to work and I guess I
                    walk too fast to be attacked by purse snatchers. Once I did have a chain taken
                    off my neck but it was a costume jewelry chain. But I realized that I must have
                    stood out — well, short hair, light skin. In Sao Paulo we had to dress up for
                    work. But I really realize now that I still was probably kind of dowdy. I didn't
                    have a real sense of style even then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought it was a shame that the Brazilian women didn't
                        wear their own lovely semi-precious stones. At least in Recife it wasn't
                        chic to wear their lovely stones, you were supposed to be dripping with
                        gold. Maybe Bahia was the same way — very large print dresses on small
                        rather round women, and nail polish one color, lipstick another color,
                        toenail polish another color.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: That was probably just in Recife because I was chided in Brasilia for
                    telling a manicurist — she was changing the colors of my fingers... yes. But
                    don't bother with the feet, “Oh, but you can't have toes and finger nails not
                    match.” We used to notice how the missionaries often wore their hair in styles
                    which were easy to pick out because they had the bubble teased haircuts of the
                    '60s. When they made clothes, they thought in terms of what had been in fashion
                    when they were last in the States, which in many cases was quite a few years
                    before. But people didn't mind — missionaries were expected to dress strangely
                    but diplomats, I guess, should try to dress differently. And, of course, they
                    attach a lot of importance to clothes, and a lot of Americans think that's too
                    frivolous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was one of the troubles I knew I would have when I
                        went down to Brazil when we were assigned there, because I always wear
                        casual shirtwaists. I said, “I know they're not going to like the way I
                        look.” And I went with silk pants, and there were times in Recife when I
                        would be the only woman in an evening pants suit, the only woman on the
                        floor talking to the men. I refused to paste myself into a chair around the
                        edge and sit and talk about babies to the woman on my left, and diets to the
                        woman on my right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: But they accept a lot of that from foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was fortunate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: And you probably had things they recognized were nice clothes even if
                    they weren't the styles they liked. The combinations some people of the lower
                    levels came up with were of obvious cheapness, or homemade, and coupled with
                    lack of style was just too much probably.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Oh, yes. In the wives' course I learned, which I had already learned from other
                    sources, that American women don't put out enough food sometimes when they're
                    entertaining; that in most other cultures they like to see a lot of food out.
                    They want to feel that they can eat all they want and that you're not being the
                    least bit stingy. That was brought to mind because someone who is employing a
                    maid that I know here in the States is rationing her food. And I know a friend
                    of mine in Montevideo lost a maid because she wasn't providing enough food. She
                    said, “Well, we're providing the same thing we eat.” I said, “Yes, Julie, But I
                    know in your household if all the hamburgers aren't eaten at lunch, they are
                    going to reappear at dinner.” I mean you've got everything more or less, as the
                    Brazilians say “counted out”. You figure out how much people are going to eat
                    and you're only going to cook that much, and that doesn't go in Latin America.
                    It doesn't go with your maids, it doesn't go with your foreign guests. When I
                    gave a party for the Uruguayan employees, it was a buffet, and I put this, this,
                    and this — a Christmas party or something — “Well, now I think that is enough,
                    but I better put out two or three more things to make sure it's enough.” And
                    didn't I hear afterwards it wasn't at all like a gringo party, it was great,
                    there was plenty of food! That's one of the things that people ought to realize,
                    too.</p>
                <p>I remember someone once gave that in a wives' course, and somebody said, “What do
                    you do with the extra food?” She said, “You freeze it and eat it later as a
                    family, or in some houses you have so many servants that you have to start
                    parceling it out.” But that's another thing that goes against the grain of a lot
                    of Americans — waste not, want not, and the same thing goes with clothes. I
                    think it is one thing that a lot of people have to be made aware of before they
                    go overseas, they may run into this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's part of transporting overseas our very practical
                        American approach to things, and just not quite being able to adapt. And I

                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: I think so, and certainly there are a lot of people are unhappy

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there are now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SANDIN: The ones that are unhappy, I think, are the single secretaries. I think
                    they are still unhappy. I think the wives may be finding more ways to occupy
                    themselves, and they're more aware perhaps that they might be unhappy, so it
                    doesn't come as a surprise to them. But I think it's unfortunate that the single
                    secretaries, and the Marine Guards of course in many posts, have a real lack of
                    social life. Those are the people that I find so left out.</p>

                    lobby for our rights as women, we didn't get involved in causes. So perhaps
                    that's why I didn't resist when the Ambassador had to approve my continuing to
                    work in Caracas and probably that's one reason it didn't bother me. Because I
                    accepted things, that's the way they were. It's still the old line of doing
                    things. If the higher ups said “no,” well, that's it.</p>

                        time that we had confidence, prosperity. He said the decade of the '50s was

                        had optimism after the depression and the war, and we were building homes,
                        about 15 million housing units were built in the decade which was almost a
