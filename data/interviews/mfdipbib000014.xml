                <p>AMBASSADOR G. NORMAN ANDERSON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: J. P. Moffat </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 18, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview of Ambassador G. Norman Anderson on
                        June 18, 1996. The interviewer is J. P. Moffat. Why don't you give us a
                        little of your background, before you came to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Basically I studied Russian while in the Navy and also went to graduate
                    school at the Russian Institute at Columbia. So my main background, oriented
                    towards the Foreign Service, was in Russian language and Soviet affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you came in to the Foreign Service in 1960, the
                        Foreign Service did not immediately choose to avail itself of this
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, I had of course requested a tour in Moscow, but I was told first
                    tour officers could not go there. However, the State Department did suggest I
                    study Arabic, a hard language. I chose Arabic because at the time the Soviet
                    Union was very active in the Arab world. So I thought Russian and Arabic would
                    be a good combination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the only one to have this combination, or was
                        this a regular thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, I think I was the first person to have such a combination. There
                    were people who had combined Russian and Chinese, but not Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this took most of two years in Washington to start the
                        Arabic training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Before I was assigned to Arabic I went to personnel, to the office that
                    assigned people to language training. That was part of the deal, they got some
                    work out of me before they sent me off to language training. but then I went to
                    Beirut in 1961, early 1961, for Arabic. I just stayed on because the ambassador
                    there, Armin Meyer, asked me to stay as his aide. So I stayed there for another
                    three years, four and a half years all together, in Beirut.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you cite for us the situation in Beirut in that
                        period between '62 and '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The situation was a bit unstable. When I arrived in Beirut for language
                    training there had just be an attempted coup against the government. The PPS,
                    which was a pan-Arab socialist group, had tried to overthrow the government. So
                    there was a great deal of tension. The main event during my stay there was the
                    presidential election, which took place in 1964. It was something of a landmark
                    because it was the first time there had been a peaceful transition through an
                    election. It came off quite well. Armin Meyer, the ambassador, worked very hard
                    on that issue and I helped him out, so we felt a certain achievement there,
                    after that election went very peacefully and smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Remind us who won the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was Charles Helou who came out as the new president. The president
                    had been Fuad Chehab, who had been the commander of the Army. A lot of people
                    thought he wanted to stay on for another term, but as things turned out he did
                    step down, and then that made possible a peaceful transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often junior officers have been used as a way to get to
                        elements that more senior people may not want to be closely identified with,
                        for one of a number of reasons. Were you used in any sort of capacity like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, we in the Political Section of course tried to keep open contacts
                    with some of the more radical elements in the country. For example, some of the
                    Palestinian radicals and Shiite radicals and people of that sort were in my
                    bailiwick, as well as the Egyptians, who at the time were quite hostile towards
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you form long lasting attachments that lasted through
                        the years, or was this a tumultuous period where you met someone and then
                        didn't see them again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Unfortunately I didn't see some of these people again. Many of them
                    were killed during various periods of fighting in Lebanon. One of our friends
                    became the PLO spokesman in the country. His name was Ghassan Kanafani.
                    Unfortunately he was blown up in a car-bomb attack at one point. So, many of
                    these people simply disappeared during either the fighting involving the
                    Palestinians or through other unfortunate events.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as you look back with the benefit of hindsight, do you
                        feel that the embassy and you yourself were able to discern the trends that
                        were going to lead the country to so much anguish in the years
                        following?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think we did recognize some of the problems just beneath the surface.
                    There was a great deal of hostility between the Moslems and Christians, and the
                    Shiite population in the south was especially unhappy. So the seeds of future
                    clashes were there the whole time. There was quite a lot of feudalism in the
                    country. Various patriarchs ran parts of the country and they had their own
                    militias. So I think we saw the seeds of destruction. We were working to try to
                    promote a more democratic society, but unfortunately the pressures on the
                    country were just too great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And do you believe that back in Washington this situation
                        was recognized or were you lonely voices out in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think a lot of the problems of Lebanon came from the outside
                    actually, even though there were internal stresses. For example, there was a
                    great deal of pressure from Syria, Egypt, Palestinians, and Israel. From the
                    southern part of the country, various attacks took place into Lebanon which were
                    very disruptive. I went to Tel Aviv at one point and had talks at the Foreign
                    Ministry as a very junior officer, and I pointed out at that point that the
                    raids into Lebanon were undermining the democratic situation there, but I don't
                    think my voice carried much weight. Other serious pressures were from
                    Palestinians coming into the country. There were already refugee camps and then
                    later on more Palestinians came and set up their own more or less independent
                    areas there. And at the same time some of the Moslem and Christian groups were
                    setting up their own militias. So, all in all, the country became more and more
                    divided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you returned to Russian training at Garmisch, it must
                        have been a pleasant year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That was a very nice year. Our first activity was a week devoted to
                    learning. We had a very good group of Russian former officers, who had mostly
                    defected during World War II. Previously I had studied Russian in the Navy with
                    various princes and counts who had defected or left in 1917. So this second
                    group was an entirely different group, brought up under the Soviet system. So it
                    was complementary to the earlier training.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In any case, after a year in Garmisch I went to Moscow as a rotating trainee,
                    became the assistant administrative officer and later political officer.
                    Actually, administrative work gave us more contact with Russians than political
                    work. I was the liaison officer with the so-called UPDK, which was the
                    organization that took care of all the servicing of embassies, including
                    providing local personnel. So I had to spend much of my time at UPDK
                    headquarters negotiating for drivers and maids and various services. And when
                    the Ambassador's plane came to Moscow I had to organize the unloading of the
                    aircraft, which meant dealing with the KGB, whose officials were all over the
                    cargoes and made life difficult for us. The KGB, for example, came up with new
                    rules for cargo every time the plane came in. Without notice, for example, we
                    were told to list everything on board, all the equipment and things of that
                    kind. Some of the equipment was very sensitive and couldn't be listed, it was in
                    sealed containers. In any case, we very often had a stand-off during which we
                    had to wait at the airport for many hours, but finally the cargo was always
                    released after the KGB had inflicted what pressures it could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you impressed or unimpressed by those elements of the
                        KGB with which you came in contact with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I found them very heavy-handed and very blatant. We of course were
                    followed and watched and our apartment and offices were bugged, but it was all
                    extremely blatant. For example, in our apartment building the shifts from the
                    listening room came down every eight hours in the elevator, so you always knew
                    they were coming from the upper floor. That always reminded you, of course, that
                    you were not alone in your apartment or office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this was in the Brezhnev era, and perhaps the
                        most exciting thing that must have happened in the period was the
                        Czechoslovak affair. Were you at all touched by this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, I was in the political section at the time and the ambassador,
                    Llewellyn Thompson, had sent in a message to Washington regarding what the
                    Soviet Union might do. As I recall, he estimated that the chances were 50-50
                    that the Soviet Union would take military action. Well, one day in August I woke
                    up and listened to the BBC, which I did every morning, and I learned that the
                    Soviet Union had invaded Czechoslovakia. So of course, I rushed to the embassy.
                    There was no sign of activity in Moscow, however. We all met in the political
                    section and mapped out our activities for the day. We were sent out into town to
                    try and put our finger on the pulse of what was going on. The only unusual event
                    was that Pravda did not come out that morning on time, and this had not happened
                    since the death of Stalin in 1953. As we were out in town Pravda did come out
                    and it was tacked up on various bulletin boards. Not too many people noticed
                    that on page four there was an article saying that the Czechoslovak party had
                    requested fraternal assistance from the Soviet brothers. But anyway, this was
                    the announcement of the invasion, which was not exactly spelled out very
                    clearly. The reactions in Moscow itself were practically invisible. There were
                    no protests to speak of. One very small group of about three or four people
                    protested in Red Square, but they were immediately carted off by the KGB. But
                    aside from that there were practically no reactions whatsoever. This held true
                    in the following days also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that this was because of repression or do you
                        think that people didn't care? What passed for public opinion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think some dissidents did express their opinions very quietly, but it
                    was very dangerous at the time to speak to foreign diplomats. So I think most
                    people just did not want to be arrested and carted off. Anybody who spoke to a
                    foreigner was at considerable risk. At one point, for example, we got lost
                    driving to our destination near Moscow and a truck driver stopped and asked
                    whether he could help us. He probably didn't know we were diplomats. We noticed
                    as we were driving off that our KGB follow car stopped the truck, and obviously
                    the driver was taken away for interrogation. So, it was not easy to speak to
                    foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think Washington was adequately prepared for this
                        move into Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think Washington was probably pretty well informed because I believe
                    our embassy had signaled the serious possibility of military action. Of course,
                    in retrospect it is hard to know what we could have done about it, probably not
                    very much. Just as there wasn't much we could do in the case of the Soviet
                    repression of Hungary, which had taken place earlier, in 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...common knowledge that what few dealings there were
                        during such a difficult period with the Russians often took place in
                        Washington, leaving the embassy out in left field. Was this the situation
                        during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: It was hard for me to judge since I was rather a junior officer at the
                    time. I know that very frequently it was hard to get appointments with high
                    level officials in Moscow. They made appointments very difficult to obtain. I
                    assume that a lot of business was done through Ambassador Dobrynin in the United
                    States, who had access to the highest levels, it seems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviet Union/Eastern European and the Arabic speaking
                        world came somewhat together in your next four or five years when you went
                        to the Soviet desk and then the Egyptian desk. Can you give us an overview
                        of what you worked on during these periods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: On the Soviet desk I was involved in Soviet foreign policy, mostly in
                    the Middle East, but also U.N. activities. I did many, many briefing papers
                    during that particular time. Actually, when I shifted to the Egyptian desk it
                    was something of a carry-over because Egypt at the time was very much under
                    Soviet influence. I think there were something like 15,000 or more Soviet troops
                    or technicians in Egypt at the time. Bases and missile systems had been
                    installed. During the first part of my tour on the Egyptian desk, the United
                    States only had an interests section in Cairo with a handful of people, but then
                    came the 1973 war and, following that, peace efforts. Finally we did renew
                    diplomatic relations with Egypt during that time. So, it was a very active
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the shift to the Nixon administration were you on
                        the Soviet desk or the Egyptian desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I was on the Egyptian desk during much of that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any effect at your level? Did you notice any
                        changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Of course, Henry Kissinger became Secretary of State during the time I
                    was on the Egyptian desk, and I think that he brought in a very noticeable
                    difference. He was quite interested in Egypt, and he made a great number of
                    trips there. Also, President Nixon went to Egypt during the later part of my
                    time on the desk. There again we, of course, did many, many briefing books. For
                    the first Kissinger trip to Cairo, I think he did depend on us a great deal, but
                    as time went on he neglected to report back what he was doing in Egypt. He
                    probably found our input much less useful as time went on. But in any case, we
                    did quite a lot of, one might say, legwork for Kissinger. I remember one case in
                    which he decided that the United States would donate a large sum of money to a
                    charity being run by Mrs. Sadat. I was given the task of implementing this
                    decision, which was not too easy to do, since there were all sorts of laws that
                    were involved. It involved donating some surplus currency in Egyptian pounds to
                    this particular charity, and that required a presidential determination that
                    this was in our national interest. The decision thus had to be authorized by
                    President Nixon. We sort of had to pick up the pieces as Henry Kissinger went
                    through his diplomatic activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he rely on alternate sources of wisdom as time went on
                        or did he appear to do it entirely on his own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think that he liked to have various analyses, but when it came to his
                    own contacts with the highest levels he was the person who knew most about them.
                    There wasn't much we could tell him about what had gone on in these contacts
                    since we were not privy to the exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...expertise must have come into play when the
                        Soviet/Egyptian friendship treaty was signed. Were you involved from both
                        sides or from one side or the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, we were asked to analyze the significance of this treaty. I was
                    on the Soviet desk and Walter Smith, another Soviet hand, was on the Egyptian
                    desk. The two of us put together our analysis and we agreed completely that we
                    should not overreact to this particular friendship treaty. We didn't think it
                    would have much practical effect. We thought it was mostly a propaganda move.
                    However, our analysis was edited as it went up the line. The outcome was an
                    analysis by our superiors that this was a much more dramatic development. By the
                    time it ended up this was a tremendously important treaty. Actually, I believe
                    Walter Smith and I were right about it because the whole thing fizzled out as
                    time went on and eventually the Egyptians threw out the Soviet technicians and
                    military personnel there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...firmly into the Arabic speaking world with your
                        assignment as political counselor to Rabat in 1974. That brought you there
                        in time for such excitements as the Green March. Can you set the stage a
                        little for us about your time in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: The Green March was a very interesting event. King Hassan announced
                    that Moroccans would start marching on the Spanish Sahara, claimed by Morocco
                    but occupied by Spain at the time. Of course we were all wondering whether he
                    could actually pull this off, but he did send hundreds of thousands, I think it
                    was 300,000, people down towards the border. They were to march across with
                    their Korans in hand without any arms. So, it was a rather clever propaganda
                    move. Indeed, as time went by, Spain did relent and set up a tri-partite
                    transitional government in the Spanish Sahara. The Mauritanians, Moroccans, and
                    Spaniards ran the Sahara during the interim period. At just that particular
                    time, the embassy was invited to send someone down to visit el-Ayoune, the
                    capital of Sahara. So, I was designated to go down there. The Moroccans took us
                    all around. Their point was to demonstrate that everyone in the Sahara wanted to
                    be Moroccan. So, they had organized all kinds of rallies and we went to a
                    session of parliament and so forth. Everywhere we turned people came up to us
                    and informed us that they wanted to join Morocco. We were sent out in
                    helicopters to some outposts in the desert. We did notice that Moroccan troops
                    were quite nervous at these places. They seemed to be on the alert for attacks
                    by the Polisario, a movement favoring independence. They breathed a sigh of
                    relief when we finally left these outposts. In any case, I think King Hassan
                    very cleverly was able to absorb the Sahara and he did withstand the many
                    attacks by the Polisario over a long period of time. He had staying power, which
                    seems to be the main factor there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that your first ambassador there, Ambassador
                        Neumann, and his colleague in Algeria engaged in a battle of telegrams that
                        would electrify Washington. Can you bring us up to date on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, some people thought there was a bit of localitis involved in the
                    reporting back and forth, and I suppose that was probably true. I think a lot of
                    the people assigned as ambassador to Morocco, as you point out in your own
                    paper, were enamored with the king. He was extremely charming and won people
                    over. It was very hard to be critical of the king. Also the king, I think, had
                    the nasty habit of getting rid of ambassadors he didn't like. So he more or less
                    assured that he had a favorable voice at the embassy. I'm not to sure what the
                    situation is today, but I wouldn't be too surprised if this continues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As your time there went on the question became more and
                        more one of U.S. military assistance for Morocco. Were you deeply involved
                        in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: No, not really. I think those questions were handled on a higher level.
                    We mostly were involved in the political contacts, especially with some of the
                    opposition parties. The ambassador, for example, probably didn't want to be too
                    deeply involved with those because King Hassan would notice and take such
                    contacts amiss. Of course, I think Morocco was very important in American policy
                    because it was one of the few friends we had among Arab countries and King
                    Hassan pursued a very moderate policy on the Arab/Israel issue, so that made him
                    quite valuable, I think, to American policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was also, was he not, involved in African

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right, I think he had much greater influence on the
                    international level than some others, in a very constructive way, so that made
                    him quite valuable. Also he took a very enlightened view regarding the Jewish
                    community in Morocco, allowed many Jews to leave the country and those who
                    remained, I think, felt quite secure as long as King Hassan was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overseas you returned to what could have been a highly
                        politicized job as the Department's liaison to the Jewish community, is that
                        correct, in 1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Yes, when I returned I was called for an interview with Ed Sanders, who
                    was the senior adviser to President Carter on liaison with the Jewish community.
                    He, I think, felt it was useful to have a career foreign service officer to keep
                    him informed on developments, especially concerning the Soviet Union and the
                    Arab world, so because of my background in both of those areas he chose me to
                    help him out. Basically, he had two offices, one next to the office of the
                    Secretary of State, and that was the office that I was assigned to, that's where
                    I sat, and then he had his office in the west wing of the White House, and he
                    commuted back and forth. As time went on, though, I think he found that he was
                    more influential in the White House, so he spent virtually all his time there.
                    So, I was called over to brief him in the White House on a daily basis, and that
                    was very interesting. In any case, my job was to read through all the telegrams
                    and hear what was going on regarding various issues touching on the Jewish
                    community and the Soviet Union, for instance the question of emigration. At the
                    time the Soviet union had been allowing more people to leave, which was
                    positive, but on the other hand not as many as wanted to leave, so there were
                    pressures for greater emigration. With regard to the Middle East, of course, Mr.
                    Sanders was very interested in negotiations on Arab-Israeli peace efforts, so I
                    tried to keep him abreast. Also, we helped to brief groups of visitors to the
                    White House and State Department on these matters.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I think it was a very valuable position because it helped to keep this
                    senior advisor to the president informed about the facts of what was going on,
                    otherwise he might form opinions that were based on incomplete information or
                    information that could be less accurate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the more frustrating experiences where you were, as
                        I understand, trained in the Ukrainian language in preparation for being
                        assigned as Consul General to Kiev, a post to be opened. Unfortunately, this
                        was interrupted by the Afghan war. Did you find it as frustrating an

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: My wife and I were in Ukrainian together, and we got to know the
                    Ukrainian community in Washington quite well, a very nice group. However, at
                    Christmas in 1979 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and President Carter decided
                    not to open the post that we were going to the following summer. So, this was
                    quite frustrating; however, we were shifted to another Slavic language,
                    Bulgarian, and we ended up going to the area, at least, to Sofia, where I was
                    DCM.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were always brought up on the truism that Bulgaria was
                        the closest state to the Soviet Union in the outside world, and yet now,
                        since the disappearance of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria has been very
                        surprisingly successful as an independent state. Do you have any wisdom to
                        share on what makes Bulgarians tick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Bulgaria in the early 1980s was not quite the overt police state that,
                    say, Romania was. The president at the time, Todor Zhivkov, was able to keep
                    very tight control, but not through having a lot of policemen in uniform in
                    evidence, and there were no Soviet troops in the country. I think the Bulgarians
                    did show a certain fondness for the Russians because the Russians had liberated
                    them in 1878 from the Turks and Russia lost something like 200,000 troops killed
                    in that campaign. So, there is a very long term historical relationship. At the
                    present time Bulgaria still, I think, resembles Russia more than a lot of the
                    other states in the area. Although most Bulgarians have studied Russian, for
                    example, some of the other people of the area, such as the Yugoslavs, have not
                    done that. But even today, the Bulgarians have reverted to rule by their
                    Socialist party, which is made up of former Communist leaders. So, in a way, now
                    they're more Russian than the Russians. The Russians have turned to greater
                    democracy, and recently voted against the Communists.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: We were trying to broaden our relations with Bulgaria, to try to wean
                    it from the Soviet Bloc. This was obviously a very long term effort. It was not
                    going to happen overnight. But we did, for example, try to develop commercial
                    relations. Various American companies became involved, Pepsi Cola for example,
                    became involved with Bulgaria and started buying Bulgarian wine for sale in the
                    United States. There was a trade fair in which American companies took part in
                    Plovdiv. All in all, though, progress was extremely slow, the control of the
                    Communist party over the country was very, very firm, despite the fact that such
                    control was not overt. It was pretty subtle. We spent two years there and we
                    were never once invited into a private home. Whereas recently we happened to go
                    back to Bulgaria several times and were invited to homes practically every
                    day.</p>

                    and many people thought the Bulgarian secret service, which was called the DS,
                    was involved in it at the behest of the KGB. I think the situation is a bit
                    unclear, as to whether that was actually true or not. Undoubtedly the two secret
                    services—the KGB and DS—were very closely involved and the Russian ambassador
                    was a God-like commissar figure in Sofia. So the connections were very, very
                    strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to have good relationships with your Soviet
                        colleagues there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Actually I did have quite a good relationship with the Soviet DCM
                    there. There were two different DCMs. The first one was quite friendly and we
                    had many conversations. The second one was more of an ideologue, and he had
                    written a book about the United States. He'd never been to the United States,
                    but he wrote a book about capitalist exploitation and repression of the masses,
                    from the far away vantage point of Moscow. The Soviet Embassy people
                    nevertheless were relatively friendly and we did get together quite a bit. Q:
                    Well now a counterpoint in your career reappears and you're off to the Arab
                    world again as DCM in Tunis. Can you set the stage for us on your time in Tunis
                    from 1982 to 1986?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Tunisia was similar to Morocco in that it was a friend to the United
                    States, a rare friend in the Arab world. In fact, President Bourguiba had been
                    very pro-American ever since Tunisian independence in 1956. He'd been granted a
                    visa to the United States even before that at one point when he was under
                    pressure from the French authorities. So he remembered it with great fondness.
                    He was probably the most pro-American leader in the Arab world. We rewarded
                    Tunisia with a great deal of economic and military assistance. So the United
                    States had a very close relationship with Tunisia.</p>
                <p>What stands out in my mind were some of crises that took place while I was there.
                    For example, the Israeli Air Force bombed PLO headquarters in Tunisia. Usually
                    when that kind of thing occurred, the mobs formed up downtown and marched on the
                    American Embassy because they held the Americans responsible for such
                    activities.</p>
                <p>Just to backtrack, when I first arrived in Tunis in 1982, the embassy was
                    surrounded by a cordon of buses, military personnel with dogs on guard all
                    around the embassy, because at that time, Israel had invaded Lebanon and was
                    crushing the PLO in Beirut. Finally the PLO leader, Arafat escaped to Tunisia
                    and was saved. But in any case, every time tension arose between Israel and the
                    Arab world, the United States was blamed. Another crisis was the raid by the
                    United States against Libya. That was also held against us, of course. Mobs
                    again formed up and marched on the embassy; fortunately, the police were
                    effective enough to keep these mobs at some distance.</p>
                <p>Another crisis was the bread riots. Bourguiba, who was becoming quite elderly at
                    the time, decided suddenly to double the price of bread. This set people off
                    into the streets and over a hundred people were killed in this rampage. Law and
                    order completely broke down and it was a very tense situation. I happened to be
                    Charg� d'Affaires at the time. Bourguiba called me to his palace in Carthage to
                    try to explain what was going on . I remember the trip out there quite well. It
                    was around six in the evening. Everywhere smoke was billowing from fires and
                    burning tires in the streets. We drove out the long distance to Carthage with a
                    driver and a security man and on the way there was a group of people throwing
                    rocks. They hit our windshield, which was shattered immediately. We sped away.
                    We finally got to the palace and Bourguiba explained that everything was under
                    control. He had just instituted military law. After he explained the situation,
                    I got on the telephone to the embassy and we relayed the gist of the
                    conversation back to Washington. Meanwhile, our security officers had been very
                    busy trying to protect the American school and get the children back into the
                    hands of their parents. The embassy of course was right downtown and various
                    mobs were marching back and forth being shot at by the police before our eyes.
                    We had to spend the night in the embassy because of a curfew. This was one of
                    the more harrowing experiences I've had in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to deal with Arafat or his assistants?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: No we didn't have any contacts with the PLO during the time I was
                    there. Later, however, the embassy was authorized to carry on a dialog with
                    Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The diplomatic vineyards led to your elevation to be
                        ambassador to Sudan in 1986, a year after the overthrow of Nimeiri and a
                        very difficult time. Could you set the stage for us on your time in
                        Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The situation was somewhat shaky when I arrived out there. The new
                    government had just taken over, the democratic government of Sadiq al-Mahdi who
                    was prime minister. This had been preceded by a year under a transitional
                    military council. During that particular year of transition there had been some
                    events that hurt relations with the United States. For example, Nimeiri, the
                    dictator, had been quite a friend of the United States. He supported peace in
                    the middle east, he supported President Sadat and the Camp David agreement. He
                    was very anti-Libyan. He was quite an enemy of Qadhafi. In a third area, he'd
                    also been quite helpful, he was secretly involved in smuggling Jews, Falashas,
                    Ethiopian Jews from Ethiopia, by way of Sudan to Israel. Well, this particular
                    airlift became public in the transitional period. So there was a severe reaction
                    against the U.S. and its role.</p>
                <p>The transitional military council put on trial various members of the Nimeiri
                    regime for involvement in this airlift of Falashas. During the trials, which
                    were televised, the role of the United states was depicted and this led to
                    numerous anti-American demonstrations. Before I arrived there, in November 1985
                    the embassy was reduced; there were something like 225 Americans there at the
                    time and that number was cut by perhaps 10%. These were people involved somehow
                    in the Falasha issue.</p>
                <p>Then just before I got there, this was in April 1986, Libyan terrorists attacked
                    an American staff member and shot him in the head. He survived, but
                    unfortunately was incapacitated. That led to another evacuation, so when I
                    arrived in Khartoum there was only a skeleton staff of about 52 people. This was
                    way down from the Nimeiri period in which the Embassy had been quite large. The
                    main problem facing me on arrival was the question of terrorism.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>One of my first jobs was to look at the security situation and decide whether we
                    could bring back some of the other employees plus the dependents who had been
                    evacuated. It turned out that there were a lot of reports about impending
                    terrorism against Americans but some of the information, as it turned out, had
                    been fabricated. Informants had given all kinds of reports in exchange for money
                    from the US. Some of them had even passed lie detector tests. So I guess the lie
                    detector was not infallible in this particular instance. Because one of these
                    informants finally let it out that he had fabricated all the details, such as
                    what kind of vehicles were going to be used for kidnapping Americans and where
                    they were going to be taken and so on and so forth. Reports about snipers
                    waiting here and there to ambush people. All these things were completely
                    fabricated. Anyway after a few months there we got permission from Washington to
                    bring back some staff members. By the end of the year, this was about four or
                    five months later, we were allowed to bring younger dependents back. So finally
                    toward the end of 1986, we were operating at more or less a normal level again
                    after very much disruption.</p>
                <p>Of course the disruption had affected all of our programs there, such as economic
                    aid and military assistance. Without staff there, obviously we couldn't carry on
                    some of these activities and a lot of money in the aid pipeline for Sudan was
                    being held up pending an improvement in the security situation. So finally by
                    the end of 1986 we were able to resume some of these activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sadiq al-Mahdi was certainly one of the more enigmatic
                        figures. What is your reading of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: I always found him extremely charming and affable, a very polite
                    individual. He was the great-grandson of the Sudanese Mahdi of the 1880's, who
                    was really the first Islamic nationalist in Sudan. He set the tone for the
                    country for many years afterward..</p>
                <p>Sadiq al-Mahdi was the leader of the main religious sect in the country, the
                    Ansar sect, these had been the followers of the early Mahdi. The Ansar sect was
                    the basis for Sadiq's political party. Well, no party won a majority in the 1986
                    elections, so Sadiq al-Mahdi had to forge various coalition governments during
                    his time. The main other sect in the country the Khatmiyyaa sect, had also
                    become the basis for a political party, the Democratic Unionist party. These two
                    parties, Sadiq's party, which was called the Ummah Party and the DUP, the other
                    sectarian-based party, were the main parties in the coalition government. Then,
                    the opposition was made up of the National Islamic Front, which was more
                    militant. The three groups were in intensive competition with one another, which
                    made democracy unstable.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>You asked about the personality of Sadiq al-Mahdi. Actually, he probably should
                    have been a university professor, because he liked to talk very much. Whenever I
                    had to go see him, I always had to rush through my talking points, before he
                    started talking, because once he started talking, it was very difficult to
                    insert any ideas. So I had to make sure my presentation was concise and to the
                    point. He was always very good at listening for a very short period of time and
                    he did absorb what was said to him. But then he liked to philosophize and give
                    his point of view at length. He was always very charming. Of course, his
                    loquaciousness made him somewhat difficult to deal with, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile the trouble was brewing down south which erupted
                        in 1983 into what became one of the more intractable civil wars. From up in
                        Khartoum were you fully aware of the depth of feeling and the problems that
                        were going on down south?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: The civil war and then the famine that resulted from the civil war were
                    two of the main issues we dealt with virtually every day. Every single demarche
                    I made in Khartoum had something to do with these issues. The war had been going
                    on for quite some time. It really started in 1955. Then during the Nimeiri
                    period it was resolved for a time in 1972 by an agreement between Nimeiri, who,
                    of course, was a dictator, and the leader of the rebel movement, Joseph Lagu.
                    The settlement was quite a good compromise, and it lasted for 11 years, until
                    1983, when the war resumed. But Nimeiri himself undermined the agreement by
                    whittling away at it. He undermined southern autonomy. Then also he instituted
                    Islamic law in 1983. The war resumed in 1983, actually it resumed just before
                    Islamic law, but Islamic law was a contributing factor in preventing a new peace
                    agreement. Nimeiri started implementing some of the Islamic punishments, such as
                    amputation of hands, and this made it all the more difficult to reinstate a
                    settlement of the war and the war just got worse and worse.</p>
                <p>We were very much aware of it because it had an effect on our relations, of
                    course. In every respect it undermined our aid program. It was very hard to
                    bolster the economy when the economy was being drained by the war, which was
                    very costly. Some people thought it cost about a million dollars a day, which is
                    a terrible drain on a very poor economy. Then also, people were starving in the
                    south. So we instituted a tremendous relief program, but it was difficult to
                    implement it because neither side in the war really endorsed the relief program
                    very much for one reason or another. So then our military assistance program was
                    affected because we didn't want to provide arms that could be used against part
                    of the population in the south. The United States was very active in peace
                    efforts. We tried to put the two sides together again and again. A lot of people
                    blame Sadiq al-Mahdi but the rebel leader, John Garang, was very difficult to
                    deal with and not particularly amenable to peace efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his motivations? He's a very controversial
                        figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: When the war broke out again in 1983, he was in the Sudanese army. He
                    was a colonel stationed in Khartoum. He's quite intellectual, he'd studied in
                    the United States, went to Grinell college and the University of Iowa, and got a
                    Ph.D. In any case, he was on leave in his hometown in the south when a
                    rebellion, or mutiny broke out in that hometown, which is Bor, and the rebels
                    asked him to lead the movement. He agonized over this decision for some time but
                    finally decided he should be more loyal to his fellow southerners than to the
                    dictator Nimeiri, so he did take up leadership of the rebellion. This movement
                    was called the SPLM, Southern Peoples' Liberation Movement. The military branch
                    was the SPLA, for army. The SPLA or rebel army became quite strong quite fast.
                    The numbers grew and all during the Sadiq al-Mahdi prime ministership in
                    northern Sudan, the southern rebels took over more and more territory and
                    finally ended up besieging the few southern towns remaining in government hands.
                    The Sudanese army remained in control of several of the larger towns but all the
                    rest of the area was under rebel control. The rebels refused to let food into
                    these towns, so a lot of these people were starving in the towns and in the
                    countryside. Because of the civil war, farmers were unable to grow crops. There
                    were not just the army and the rebels fighting, but all kinds of marauders and
                    tribal militias and what not were rampaging around the countryside. So nobody
                    could provide adequate food for the population either in the towns or in the
                    countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for al-Mahdi's political demise and his
                        replacement in effect by Turabi, am I correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. This was in June 1989. It happened that we had been in
                    Washington, my family and I, for consultations and we arrived back at Khartoum
                    airport at two a.m. on June 30. Well, it just so happened that two a.m. was zero
                    hour for the coup. We were just about the last flight to arrive. We didn't
                    notice anything at the time, we got into our car and drove off. But literally
                    minutes later the airport was taken over by the rebels, by the mutineers I guess
                    you would call them, not the southern rebels. We drove past army headquarters on
                    our way from the airport and that was very quiet. Well, moments later the coup
                    plotters took over the military headquarters.</p>
                <p>I was called out of bed after a very short sleep that night and went into the
                    embassy. We'd heard on the radio that a coup had taken place. There was nothing
                    very noticeable on the road, everything was very, very quiet. So I drove to the
                    embassy without incident.</p>
                <p>We had very good contacts with the Sudanese military. First of all because we'd
                    had a long-term military assistance program, particularly under Nimeiri. Our aid
                    was quite large. Many Sudanese officers had trained in the United States, so we
                    able to contact these people to try and find out what was going on. We had good
                    sources on what was happening and we also listened to the radio.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Well, it was very surprising that the population seemed to acquiesce in the coup,
                    even though it meant the demise of democracy. Unfortunately, Sadiq al-Mahdi had
                    disappointed people very much. He hadn't resolved any of the country's serious
                    problems, he hadn't resolved the civil war, he had many, many economic problems.
                    He didn't institute reforms, so that the country became poorer and poorer as
                    time went on. Also he had a sort of non-aligned foreign policy which catered
                    mostly to Libya, Iran and Iraq. In the end, everybody was quite disillusioned,
                    so nobody stood up and tried to save the democratic regime.</p>
                <p>The military officers who took over imprisoned all the political leaders,
                    including Hassan Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front, which had
                    been one of the main opposition parties, but had also participated in the
                    government at various times, too. Turabi had been Minister of Justice with Sadiq
                    and he'd even been Foreign Minister. So he'd been part of the government. One of
                    the problems that Sadiq had had to face was trying to balance between the more
                    extreme Islamic elements and the more moderate elements. He ended up making
                    everybody unhappy. He couldn't really satisfy anybody, so he ended up without
                    very much support. Anyway, Turabi and the National Islamic Front, volunteered to
                    help the military coup leaders as time went on. They provided many of the
                    officials, especially the middle ranks in various ministries. With time they
                    really infiltrated the government and became a very powerful force. But that was
                    not the case from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of ink has been spilled on Turabi as a somewhat
                        sinister figure in the area. What is your appreciation of him as a man, a
                        leader, an ideologue? How do you come down on him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: He was certainly the most impressive political personality in the
                    country. Sadiq al-Mahdi was quite impressive and very well educated himself—he'd
                    gone to Oxford and studied economics. But Hassan Turabi was even more of an
                    intellect and scholar. Really on an international level. He was certainly one of
                    the most clever politicians and impressive ones. He's not at all what you'd
                    expect from an Islamic leader. He's not a mad mullah or anything of that sort,
                    he's very suave and sophisticated. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor and
                    is extremely good at dealing with foreigners. Of course, he's extremely
                    ideological, has answers to every question based on Islamic ideas. During our
                    time there, he really portrayed himself as a moderate. I think compared to say,
                    Khomeini, he was a moderate indeed. He always seemed quite rational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But since your time he appears, has he not, to have become
                        more and more involved with the no-goodniks of the international world and
                        to foster terrorism and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: I'm not sure exactly what the evidence is implicating him in terrorism.
                    I did see him in Washington several years ago and he had not changed very much.
                    He was still expressing quite moderate views. He is more enigmatic, I think,
                    than most of the other leaders there. He never expressed extreme Islam, I mean,
                    he didn't favor wholesale amputations or anything of that kind. His basic
                    platform, I think you'd say, was more in the moderate range than the extremist
                    range. Now what his role is behind the scenes is very hard to gauge. I don't
                    really know to what extent he may have encouraged the presence of terrorists. I
                    just don't have a basis to judge that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were certainly at a post that raised interesting
                        policy questions and they were certainly criticisms as well as plaudits for
                        what we were doing in Sudan. How do you view your time there now, with a
                        little perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: My main regret, of course, is that democracy was overthrown. We did try
                    very hard to influence Sadiq al-Mahdi in the right direction on various issues
                    such as ending the war, famine relief, economic reform and also foreign policy.
                    Unfortunately, Sadiq was never quite decisive enough on any of the issues. For
                    instance, there was a very good opportunity to end the war. In 1988, one of the
                    coalition parties, the Dul, signed an agreement with John Garang, which was
                    quite moderate. It suspended Islamic law, for example, thereby overcoming one of
                    the most controversial issues. Sadiq al-Mahdi unfortunately did not
                    wholeheartedly endorse this agreement. At the time, he was trying to keep the
                    National Islamic Front in the government. He couldn't have it both ways. He
                    couldn't keep the Islamic extremists in the government and also promote peace,
                    because the Islamic extremists were against any tampering with Islamic law. Yet
                    the agreement with the rebels was reached by one of the other Islamic leaders,
                    who headed the other sect. So if one Islamic leader could accept freezing
                    Islamic law, why couldn't the others? Well, Sadiq wavered between these two
                    elements—moderates and extremists—and he failed to support this possibility of
                    real peace and then it was lost, unfortunately.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Also on the question of famine, Sadiq didn't exert the leadership that was
                    needed. The rebels didn't like the idea of sending food to the south because
                    they felt the army in the towns would benefit and as a result be able to hold on
                    to the towns. Also in the towns were many, many southerners who had taken refuge
                    from the chaos in the countryside. They were the ones starving. These were not
                    northern Arabs, they were southern Sudanese. The rebels were thus willing to
                    sacrifice their own people. The army in the north also didn't like famine relief
                    because it felt that if food went to southern areas occupied by the rebels, this
                    food would fall into the hands of the rebels and strengthen them militarily. So
                    nobody liked famine relief. Sadiq, unfortunately, recognized that the army could
                    overthrow him at any time, so he didn't want to push too hard himself on famine
                    relief when the army was opposed. So that's why it was extremely difficult to
                    get these various relief operations going. We negotiated, for example, for a
                    whole year to get an airlift by the ICRC (the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross). The only reason we finally succeeded was that during one of the five or
                    six cabinet reshuffles, a very good Minister of Defense came into the job. The
                    man had worked for Nimeiri. In any case, this defense minister, was extremely
                    forceful and decisive, and he decided to allow the ICRC to fly relief to both
                    sides of the fighting. But without his forceful decision, even this airlift
                    probably wouldn't have worked out. Famine relief was very difficult to implement
                    because everybody was against it and made even agreements hard to implement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to another exciting country when in 1993 you were
                        nominated to represent the then CSCE in Macedonia. Or as we should say once
                        for the record, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This was a
                        somewhat unusual assignment reflecting in many ways a changed world. Can you
                        tell us how you came to be selected and what role you played in
                        Macedonia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: President Bush had taken the initiative for sending a mission to
                    Macedonia. Two missions were sent out by the CSCE, the Conference for Security
                    and Cooperation in Europe, in 1992. One went to Belgrade and had branches in
                    what was left of Yugoslavia, in Kosovo, Voyodina and Sandjak. The other mission
                    was sent to Macedonia. Macedonia at the time was under a great deal of pressure
                    and nobody knew whether it could maintain its independence. It had declared
                    independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, at the same time as Slovenia, Croatia and
                    Bosnia did. Of course, everyone was worried that the war in Bosnia might spread
                    to Macedonia.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Now the United States had not officially recognized Macedonia and some of the
                    European countries had not either. There was no international diplomatic
                    presence there. The CSCE was actually the first international presence. The CSCE
                    mission was started by another American diplomat, Bob Frowick, who is now in
                    charge of the elections in Bosnia, so I'm sure the Macedonian experience was
                    very useful. In any case, I replaced an American out there. Bob Frowick had only
                    been able to spend about two or three months there. The State Department wanted
                    somebody to spend a longer time. So I was asked to go out and replace another
                    person, Bill Whitman, also an American, who'd also been there just a very short
                    time. I went out for six months, but ended up staying two years.</p>
                <p>Our job was to try to promote stability and the territorial integrity of
                    Macedonia. That was our mandate, but how to go about it was not spelled out. We,
                    first of all, had to determine what the threats to stability were and also what
                    to do about these various threats. In reality, there were all kinds of threats
                    to stability and we had a very broad mandate. We became involved in one way or
                    another in all these different issues. Meanwhile, the UN also sent troops to
                    Macedonia. The CSCE mission was started toward the end of 1992 and UN forces
                    arrived in January 1993. I finally got out there in March of 1993, so the UN was
                    already in place when I arrived. No American troops were yet there though. Later
                    on, about 500 American troops were added to the UN contingent. All for the sake
                    of stability. Well, the CSCE had the first international political presence
                    there. It was welcomed by the government because it was a sign of international
                    support for independence of the country.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, there were various threats to stability, some of them were
                    external threats and some were internal. The main threat the international
                    community had in mind was the threat of Serbian military intervention. The fact
                    was, the Serbs could roll into Skopje, the capital, within about two hours and
                    nobody could stop them, not even the UN. The UN didn't have heavy weapons, it
                    was a very lightly armed observer group. It was enough of a trip wire to keep
                    the Serbs out and they were busy elsewhere. Some of the other threats came from
                    other neighbors.</p>
                <p>Bulgaria for example didn't really feel that Macedonia should be a separate
                    entity. Bulgarians to this day believe that Macedonians are really Bulgarians.
                    Now, the Macedonians don't agree with this, so there are tensions with Bulgaria.
                    Also with respect to Albania, a large part of the population in Macedonia is
                    ethnically Albanian and some of the Albanian elements there believe in Greater
                    Albania, so there is always a threat of Greater Albania, which causes problems
                    in the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Finally, Greece may have been more of a problem to the country than any of the
                    other neighbors because the Greeks felt that there was an irredentist threat
                    from Macedonia. Back in history Macedonia had been a much bigger country and
                    part of it was northern Greece. The Greeks did not want to recognize an entity
                    that had once extended all the way to Thessaloniki and most of northern Greece.
                    The Greeks did not accept the name Macedonia. They objected to membership in
                    international organizations. However, a compromise was reached on the UN and
                    Macedonia came into the UN as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The
                    Greeks did not want Macedonia to be a member of the CSCE, or the European Union.
                    At one point Greece closed the border and cut off supplies of oil to Macedonia,
                    which created severe economic strains and in effect destabilized the country.
                    Those were external threats.</p>
                <p>There were also internal threats, ethnic tensions among various groups there,
                    especially Albanians, there were Serbs, Slavic Muslims, gypsies (roma, as they
                    were called) plus other groups which did not always get along well. So there
                    were problems of ethnic tension. Finally, the economy was in very bad shape. A
                    lot of people were out of jobs, had no way to support themselves. There was
                    potential for unrest on the economic front. So in all these areas we monitored
                    and tried to help the government maintain its stability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather in a sense, that it's quite a success story,
                        Macedonia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Fortunately, Macedonia had good leaders, especially President Gligorov,
                    who is very moderate. Ironically, most of the leaders there are former
                    communists. It turned out that they were the most moderate elements in the
                    country compared to some of the right wing nationalists who indeed did want to
                    go to Thessaloniki and take over, ideally speaking. The right wing elements were
                    a very serious threat to the stability of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your job was really in large part exhortatory and
                        representing the US and international, well more correctly the international
                        community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: That's right. We represented the international community. The United
                    States later recognized Macedonia and right now, in July 1996, is sending its
                    first ambassador out there after having had an interest section or liaison
                    office, as it was called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... credit for bringing about this happy situation,
                        particularly deeming the elections to have been free and fair.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ANDERSON: Our CSCE mission did, I think, contribute to stability. For example, we
                    helped to conduct a census which was very politically sensitive there. The
                    Albanian ethnic group in particular thought it was undercounted. But we helped
                    to monitor the census so it was conducted properly, along with the European
                    Union.</p>
                <p>Finally in 1994, presidential and parliamentary elections were held and our
                    mission was charged with the task of monitoring the elections. We called in a
                    lot of outside observers from CSCE countries and set up monitoring. We also went
                    around urging the various political groups to participate. The right wing
                    elements, who were a something of a threat to stability, did participate in the
                    first round of elections because we exhorted them to do that. They had been
                    telling us that the elections would be rigged. So finally, they maintained that
                    the first round was rigged and refused to participate in the second round.</p>
                <p>The CSCE found that the elections, even though there were some irregularities,
                    were basically fair and free. We in our final report and press conference on the
                    matter, we stated that, despite some irregularities, the elections were valid.
                    Now the right wing parties did not like that pronouncement and they organized
                    various rallies and demonstrations. But we urged them not to resort to violence
                    and I think we had an influence in keeping the situation calm. In any case, the
                    elections were fair and free. I believe they did lead to a further period of
                    stability in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You, certainly, next perhaps to Jack Matlock must be the
                        premier linguist in the recent Foreign Service what with Arabic, French,
                        Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Macedonian to your credit. Is
                        there any hope for others to follow in such a pattern? To what do you credit
                        you linguistic ability?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Well, it was all by chance, in a way, according to assignments. I
                    think, obviously, languages are very useful. You don't need them until you
                    really need them. You could probably get by with English in many situations,
                    these days, but in a crisis, you may not be able to get by with English and you
                    may have to rely on some exotic language. For example, in the coup in Sudan, if
                    you didn't understand the Arabic radio broadcasts, you didn't know what was
                    going on. Also the new leaders did not speak English, so my contacts with them
                    had to be in Arabic. A foreign language is definitely a window on the culture
                    and thinking of such leaders and makes for a much better understanding of
                    developments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well thank you Mr. Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANDERSON: Thank you.</p>
