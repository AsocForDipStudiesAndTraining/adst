                <p>An interview with Steven W. Sinding</p>
                <p>Interviewer: W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 27, 2001</p>
                <p>Overview of Career</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is February 27, 2001 and the interview is with Steven
                        W. Sinding. Let's start off with a thumbnail sketch of your career. How many
                        years were you with USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Nineteen, from 1971-1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the main assignments you had during the
                        19 years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The first four years I was a social science analyst in the Office
                    Population, a GS employee. I converted to the foreign service in 1975 and went
                    to Pakistan. I served in Pakistan until early 1978 when, because of Pakistan's
                    decision to develop a nuclear device, the aid program began to close down. I
                    came back to Washington and had a brief stint in the Studies Division of the
                    Office of Evaluation in PPC. And then, later that year in the fall of 1979, I
                    became the Population Officer for the Asia Bureau. A year later in 1979 I was
                    Chief of the Population, Health and Nutrition Division (PHN) division; and, in
                    1980, I went to the Philippines as Chief of the PHN Office in the USAID. I was
                    in the Philippines from mid-1980 until early 1983, when I was called back to
                    Washington to become the Director of the Office of Technical Resources of the
                    Asia Bureau. I was in that job only for a few weeks when I was asked by the
                    Administrator's office whether I would be willing to take over as the Director
                    of the Office of Population in the then Science and Technology Bureau for
                    reasons that I will come back to when we talk in more detail. So I was the
                    Director of the Office of Population from April 1983 until August 1986. And then
                    I went to Kenya as Mission Director in Kenya from August 1986 until left USAID
                    in July 1990.</p>
                <p>Early years, education and work experience</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's now go back to where you are from, where you grew
                        up, your education with a slant on what influenced you to go into
                        international development.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SINDING: I was born in Orange, New Jersey. My parents were both Hitler refugees;
                    German immigrants from Berlin. At the age of five, I moved to Winchendon,
                    Massachusetts, a little town near the New Hampshire border in central
                    Massachusetts. My father was an industrial engineer and worked for a small
                    company in Gardner, Massachusetts. In 1952, at age nine, we moved back to
                    central New Jersey to a little town called Pennington. I completed primary and
                    secondary school in Pennington. I went to Oberlin College. There are two things
                    that I should mention in that history that had an influence on my subsequent
                    career. One is that I had a Colombian uncle and my godfather, my father's room
                    mate before he married my mother, was a itinerant journalist reporting on the
                    arts. He used to travel around the world on tramp steamers and do free lance
                    work for the Christian Science Monitor and for various radio stations in Europe
                    and the United States, reporting on the arts around the developing world. He had
                    such an exotic life and an exotic career. The combination of this Colombian
                    uncle and my god father, Henry Koller, got me interested in a very early age in
                    international travel and developing areas. The second thing is that when I was
                    at Oberlin each class selected a faculty member to give a speech to the senior
                    assembly. The one that our senior class selected was given by a history
                    professor named Robert Niel, and he entitled it “The Mushroom Crowd.” It was the
                    first talk that I had ever hearthis was the Spring of 196about the population
                    explosion and the global threat of overpopulation. It had a profound influence
                    on me, although I didn't realize it at the time. I went on the graduate school
                    at University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in at Oberlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Government and history but my declared major was government or political
                    science. I got my Ph.D. at Chapel Hill in Political Science.</p>
                <p>I went to UNC intending to get a Masters in Latin American studies with an
                    emphasis on political science. But because of the Vietnam war and the likelihood
                    that I would be drafted if I left school and the fact that there was lots of
                    money around for graduate education in those daythe National Defense Education
                    Act and all that, I was easily persuaded by a couple of faculty members in the
                    Political Science Department to stay on and get a Ph.D. My dream had actually
                    been to become a foreign correspondent. My role model in life was Tad Szulc, who
                    was the Latin American correspondent for the New York Times. I thought, if I
                    could have that job, it would make me happy forever. So that was what I was
                    aiming at, and I had thought for many years that I would be a journalist, but
                    that all changed probably because of Vietnam. If it hadn't been for the near
                    certainty that I would have been drafted had I left school, I would probably
                    have left without a Ph.D. and my life would certainly would have been
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not enthusiastic about Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SINDING: I certainly didn't want to carry a rifle; I demonstrated against the
                    war, but I can't say that I was an antiwar activist. I was opposed to our
                    involvement but not to the extent of being willing to be arrested or beaten
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was you thesis about? You must have written a
                        doctoral thesis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, in fact, I went to Chile in 1968 as a Latin American Teaching
                    Fellow. That is a relevant part of the story and how I wound up at USAID. My
                    doctoral thesis was on the relationship between political participation, public
                    expenditure policy and inflation in Chile. I looked at empirical data over a
                    forty year period - 1928 to 1968 - roughly that period of time, trying to track
                    whether you could discern patterns of political participation that produced
                    inflationary expenditure patterns on the part of government, and what effect
                    that had on electoral outcomes and on subsequent economic growth and economic
                    policy. It was really a dissertation on political economy.</p>
                <p>My major in graduate school was really in political development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was a conceit of political science that, if there was such a thing as
                    economic development, there must be something called political development. But
                    what it was really about was the politics of developing areas. I had only one or
                    two courses in political development; that was all that was offered. I took
                    courses on development economics and basically courses in comparative politics
                    and the politics of Latin America. But Latin American politics was a
                    particularly strong area at Chapel Hill. There were two internationally known
                    experts FredericGil and John Martz who ran that program. I feel that I got a
                    very good graduate education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were fluent in Spanish at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SINDING: I went to Mexico is 1968 with a grant of some kind and studied intensive
                    Spanish. I had done Peace Corp training between my junior and senior years of
                    college but never went into the Peace Corps. Peace Corps for a couple of years -
                    maybe for one year - had something called the “Senior Year Program.” It was an
                    experiment to see if you trained people between their junior and senior years,
                    and they used their senior year academically to prepare for Peace Corps, you
                    would get volunteers who were better prepared than people who had only regular
                    Peace Corps training. I think that the conclusion was that it didn't work. For
                    one thing, they had an extraordinary drop out rate. But also academic training
                    has no particular utility for Peace Corps assignments. And so they dropped the
                    program. But I did it actually to avoid getting drafted, because I had dropped
                    out of college in my junior year to try out journalism. I worked for a
                    newspaper. No sooner had I dropped out than I got my notice to take a physical
                    and was within weeks of being inducted when Frank Thompson, my Congressman,
                    interceded with the selective service system in Washington to prevent my
                    actually getting my draft notice. But in the mean time I had discovered that by
                    going into the Peace Corps training program I could regain my deferment. So
                    that's what I did. I would have gone into the Peace Corps, but I had a choice
                    between graduating from college on time which would have meant taking summer
                    courses after my class graduated or going into the Peace Corps and deferring
                    graduation until afterward. I decided I didn't want to go into the Peace Corps
                    without my B.A., which was probably was a mistake, but anyway I didn't go into
                    the Peace Corps. I went to graduate school instead and did spend that summer
                    after graduation getting my B.A. degree. I married my wife Monica, who becomes
                    part of the story. That combination of getting married, having a good fellowship
                    to go to graduate school and her lack of enthusiasm for going to Boliviall of
                    that contributed to the decision to go to graduate school and get the Ph.D.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the dissertation was about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Interestingly, before I went off to Chile to do my dissertation I got a
                    call from the head of the Carolina Population Center asking me whether I would
                    like to do my dissertation on a population subject. Because he had lots of money
                    from USAID to support graduate theses in the population field, particularly in
                    population polica man named Moye Freymann who had been with the Ford Foundation
                    for many years in India and was a one of the early leaders of the population
                    movement. I declined that. That was my only brush with population up to that
                    point. There was one other event that was of some interest. To pay the rent
                    between my second and third year of graduate school, I took a job with another
                    professor in the School of Public Health. He had a Ford Foundation grant to
                    study the process through which states individually were liberalizing their
                    abortion laws. This was before the Roe versus Wade decision and the pro choice
                    community in the United States was providing assistance to advocacy groups in
                    the individual states to liberalize the abortion laws. They were going state by
                    state - California was one of the first; North Carolina was one of the first.
                    New York was, of course, early on. Georgia, Colorado. Those are the ones I
                    remember. This guy, Sagar Jain, who was later a big grantee of USAID, had Ford
                    Foundation money essentially to document that process of abortion law
                    liberalization. I wrote the North Carolina case study. So that was my third
                    brush with population. The first was the speech at the Senior Assembly at
                    Oberlin; this was the second - the abortion law study - and third was this call
                    trying to entice me to do my dissertation on a population topic. But since I had
                    good money from the Latin American Teaching Fellowship and a thesis topic which
                    I had defended in my prelims, I wasn't prepared to change my thesis at that
                    point. So off I went to Chile and did the dissertation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Fascinating. It was the last year of the Frei regime. Things were
                    heating up for the election of 1970, which produced Salvador Allende. And my
                    thesis in a way predicted the Allende election, because it was the end of a
                    process of growing political participation which was incrementally moving the
                    system further and further to the left as more and more marginalized groups
                    became politically active. And I could see the Allende election coming as that
                    process was playing itself out. We left Chile about three months before Allende
                    was actually elected. It was a fascinating period.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense that the Allende regime was leading
                        into a communist regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The U.S. Ambassador at the time was Edward Korry, who had been a Kennedy
                    appointee; he had been Ambassador to Ethiopia before he went to Chile. I think
                    he was an editor at one point for Look magazine. A colorful character. Korry was
                    certainly sending cables to Washington that were pretty alarmist about Allende,
                    and the CIA certainly was active. In fact, they tried to recruit me and several
                    of my colleagues. Not to become CIA employees but to become informants, while we
                    were in Chile, on what our Chilean contacts were saying and doing. I remember,
                    in fact, being invited to dinner at the home of the Special Assistant to the
                    Ambassador, who later turned out was - I don't think he was the station chief -
                    but he was clearly a CIA guy with Embassy cover. And being grilled about what
                    our Chilean colleagues at the University of Chile and the Latin American Faculty
                    of the Social Sciences and other hot beds were talking about. I remember going
                    to what were called in Chile “boites” the French term for a kind of cabaret or
                    night clulistening to protest folk music sung by Victor Jara, who later became a
                    symbol of Pinochet's violence. He was killed in that first wave of executions at
                    the time of the coup. None of us ever believed that, if the Chilean military was
                    finally impelled to move, it would do so with the violence that it did. I
                    believeas did everybody who studied Chile dithat it was a stable democracy and
                    that there was enormous tolerance and flexibility within the system to deal with
                    dissent. Then through the Allende years, which I basically observed from here. I
                    could see increasingly that the pressures were building for the military to
                    intervene because of the collapse of the Chilean economy and the widespread
                    disaffection of the middle class. I never imagined, and certainly, on the basis
                    of my time in Chile, could not have imagined, that the Chilean military would be
                    as brutal in its actions as it was. That caught everybody by surprise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on from graduate school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Finished graduate school and took, for me, what was a disappointing
                    teaching assignment. During my last couple of months at grad school I had gotten
                    inquiries from first rate universities and fully expected that I would wind up
                    with my first teaching job at a place like Michigan or Princeton which were two
                    of the schools that had inquired. I wasn't on the job market and so I had said I
                    will be on the market next year. When I did go on the market in 1970 basically
                    the academic job market had collapsed, and there just weren't may good jobs in
                    any field, and, in Latin American politics that was certainly the case. There
                    were three decent jobs: Duke was a good one; Indiana, which was ok; and
                    Kentucky, which was the weakest. And I didn't get either of the first two. I got
                    the Kentucky job. I went to Lexington and, although I enjoyed my colleagues and
                    I enjoyed teaching that year at the University of Kentucky, I felt totally
                    isolated from the people and issues that interested me. There was very small
                    contingent of Latin Americanists; very small group of people who had
                    international interests of any kinmost of them were in the agriculture school. I
                    felt that I was in a provincial place. I had always been on the East coast; not
                    at Oberlin but Oberlin is a very cosmopolitan place and a very sophisticated
                    place. I felt that I was in a backwater; frustrating.</p>

                <p>Joined USAID/Washington in the Population Office - 1971-1975</p>
                <p>In the Spring of 1971, I came to Washington on something called the
                    ScholarDiplomat Seminar, which was something the State Department was running in
                    the early '70s as a way, I think, of trying to win the affections of disaffected
                    academics. A lot of us out there were critics of Vietnam policy and, basically,
                    of American foreign policy. And the ScholarDiplomat Seminar was an opportunity
                    to sit on a desk at the State Department for a week. We had been precleared with
                    access up to and including Secret communications. We had a program of lectures
                    and conversations and so on with some fairly senior State Department people and
                    a chance to sit on the desk and read the cable traffic. I was on the Chile desk,
                    and I read a lot of the cable traffic in the 197071 period and, of course, the
                    stuff that I had access to wasn't the good stuff which is now coming out which
                    did reveal the extent of American involvement in the Pinochet coup. But it was
                    pretty clear from reading the cable traffic where the sympathies of the State
                    Department lay and the concerns about where Allende was going. This was just a
                    week. The reason it was relevant was that I stayed with a fellow, who is still
                    in USAID, David Mutchler. David and I had both been Latin American Teaching
                    Fellows in Santiago at the same time. We had been good friends, played
                    basketball together, trips together, our wives were very good friends. So when I
                    came to Washington for that week I stayed with the Mutchlers and David, who had
                    been teaching at Federal City College (now the University of District Columbia),
                    had just joined USAID in the East Asia Bureau in the population program. He was
                    office mate of a fellow named Tom Reese, who subsequently made quite a name for
                    himself in the agency, and Mutchler said to me, you know, there is this brand
                    new population program that has oodles of money, and I think they are looking
                    for a political scientisrun by this crazy guy named Ravenholt. You ought to go
                    over and talk with him. So Mutchler made an appointment for me; Ravenholt
                    couldn't see me; he was traveling and wasn't around, but he made an appointment
                    for me to see James Brackett, who was the chief of what was then called the
                    Analysis and Evaluation Division. He was a demographer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the population office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SINDING: In the Office of Population in the old TAB, Technical Assistance Bureau.
                    Brackett offered me a job on the spot. He said if you come to Washington, we
                    will put you to work. Monica had come east with me, and she and our nine month
                    old daughter Kate had gone up to Princeton to spend that week with her parents
                    and my parents. They both lived in Princeton at the time. And so she came back
                    down to Washington at the end of the week to pick me up to drive back to
                    Lexington. On that long drive back to Lexington, Kentucky we debated should I
                    take this job in Washington after one year of teaching at Kentucky? I was doing
                    pretty well. I had just been elected to the Faculty Senate, and I had my first
                    publication coming out. I clearly was on a track to what I think would have been
                    a respectable academic career. So it wasn't an easy decision. But, in the course
                    of that week in Washington, I had really contracted a severe case of Potomac
                    fever. I really wanted to be in the center of the action. I actually didn't
                    think much of USAID and as a student of Latin American politics there was much
                    about what the U.S. Government was doing in Latin America which I highly
                    disapproved of, including what we were doing in Chile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USAID ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Not USAID so much. In fact, I had a couple of friends at USAIBob
                    Maushammer and Jean. We became good friends, and we did things together. But
                    institutionally I thought USAID was part of an American foreign policy toward
                    Latin America that was short sighted, inclined to support repressive regimes. I
                    was a typical '60s leftist and did not think highly of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned in passing that you had your first
                        publication. What was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was from my dissertation. It was a chapter of the dissertation.So we
                    made a decision on that trip back to Lexington in our 1967 VW squareback that we
                    would take a flyer. I remember going in the next morning and telling the
                    chairman of the department that I was going to leave and take this job in
                    Washington. I can't believe in retrospect how naive I was. I had nothing in
                    writing. I had no idea that USAID couldn't just hire people off the street like
                    that. I took Brackett at his word so I called him up and I said I was going to
                    come. And he said: “Oh, well... You'll will probably have to work for the first
                    few months for the Census Bureau. We have a PASA with them, and so we will get
                    them to hire you, but you will actually sit here in the USAID offices, and you
                    will work for me, but you will be a Census Bureau employee.” So my first day of
                    Federal employment was in Suitland, Maryland where I went to actually fill out
                    the paper work to become a Bureau of Census GS12 employee. Then the next day I
                    went to Rosslyn to start my career in the Office of Population.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>As I was saying in retrospect if I had known then what I know now about what it
                    takes to become a Federal employee, I never would have given up my tenure track
                    position at Kentucky on the basis of a verbal commitment from Jim Brackett. But
                    it all worked out. It took a while; it took a year and a threat of resignation
                    for Brackett to get the USAID system to convert me to GS, and I said with my
                    Ph.D. and experience that I qualified for a GS13, and I insisted on that as
                    well. And they all happened. I remember Don Anderson was the head of the
                    personnel division in TAB at the time. Brackett had to go and plead with Don
                    Anderson to make all this happen. But it did happen; that was 1972. I joined in
                    August 1971, and it took almost a year for the conversion to come though. So I
                    was a social science analyst in the Analysis and Evaluation Division of the
                    Technical Assistance Bureau. The Office of Population had become a fullfledged
                    office a couple years earlier. It had been part of the old War on Hunger before
                    that. But TAB got organized around '7071. Joel Bernstein was the first Assistant
                    Administrator; he was the AA when I joined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was TAB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was a central technical bureau of the agency. The theory was that
                    USAID did its work through field missions backed by regional bureaus. The
                    regional bureaus all had technical offices, but there was a sense that while
                    those technical offices were good for supporting mission programs they were not
                    at the cutting edge of what was happening in each of the substantive fields. So
                    that in addition to the regional bureaus' technical offices, it would be good to
                    have a central bureau staffed by people who would be at the cutting edge of what
                    was happening in agriculture, health and population, rural development,
                    education - the various development sectors of that time.</p>
                <p>The job in population was then already different. It was different in a couple of
                    very important respects. One is that by an agreement, an experiment, which Bob
                    Nooter explained to me (former Deputy Administrator of the Agency), because of
                    the congressional interest in population and the intense pressure that the
                    agency was under somewhat against its will to move aggressively into population,
                    the powers at the top of the agency felt that this would be a good place to
                    experiment with an idea, that was around but looked on with considerable
                    disfavor by the regional bureaus in the State Department, to have a centrally
                    managed global program. So unlike all other sectors, the Office of Population
                    had the authority both approve the assignments of population officers in the
                    field and to have veto power over bilateral population projects. You couldn't
                    obligate funds or get a project approved in a country unless Ravenholt said it
                    was ok. By the same token you couldn't get assigned to work as a population
                    officer in the field unless Ravenholt approved the assignment. So the Office of
                    Population, in addition to its own budget, had effective control over the entire
                    agency budget in population. It was the only example in my experience with USAID
                    going over 30 years of a true unified global program in which the regional
                    bureaus were secondary to a global strategy run out of the central office.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it had big budget as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It had huge budget - a budget that was growing by 2550 percent each
                    year. Between 1969 and 1974 the Office of Population budget grew from $25
                    million to $125 million - in $25 million increments or more over that
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That included all the mission projects as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: That included everything, but that was a huge amount of money at that
                    time. It was, in fact, more money than the agency could intelligently program
                    through its normal processes. So that there was a lot of money sloshing around
                    in Washington available for young entrepreneurial types who wanted to get things
                    going. Because the Missions weren't asking for funds and Washington could only
                    force a certain amount of money into mission budgets, Ravenholt had a huge
                    amount of money for central programming. His solution for that problem was to
                    find existing organizations in the population field that would agree to take
                    USAID money in return for carrying out projects. So lots of aid intermediaries
                    were created at that time. Some of them were existing organizations that took
                    money; some of them were created out of whole cloth like Family Planning
                    International Assistance program of the Planned Parenthood Federation of
                    America, which was created to become a channel moving USAID money to local NGOs
                    in the developing world that were doing family planning work. Many of them
                    religiously based organizations. International Planned Parenthood in London, the
                    Pathfinder Fund in Boston, the Population Council in New York, several of the
                    universities which had created population centers around the United States.
                    These all became big recipients of USAID money. The Centers for Disease Control
                    and the Census Bureau were PASA partners in the population program. That was the
                    way in which a great deal of the money was moved in those years. And, of course,
                    an enormous amount was used for the purchase of contraceptives, because
                    Ravenholt had a deep seated belief that the principal constraint was the supply
                    of contraceptives not the demand for them. This was a radical view and not a
                    widely accepted view at the time.</p>

                <p>SINDING: Originally, in my first year I was in the Analysis and Evaluation
                    Division, Jim Brackett was the chief and a fellow named Tom Lyons was the deputy
                    chief. Jim was a demographer and Tom was also a political scientist. Tom was in
                    charge of the population policy side of things. There were a couple of
                    economists in the division; there were two or three demographers; there was
                    another Census Bureau employee who basically worked on vital registration
                    systems and that sort of thing. Originally, I was given the task of managing
                    grants to the University of North Carolina for a population policy research
                    project. The National Academy of Sciences through which we were channeling funds
                    to something called the American Universities Field Staff. This was an
                    organization supported by a set of the U.S. universities which wanted to have
                    people in developing countries writing free lance reports basically on whatever
                    interested them that was going on in the developing world. They tended to be
                    anthropologists and journalists. They wrote really interesting stuff; we made a
                    grant to them through the National Academy of ScienceI can't remember why we
                    went through the NAS. I think it went through the NAS, because Ravenholt had a
                    brother who was a member of AUS staff. But anyway the NAS managed this for
                    USAID; I, in turn, managed the relationship with the NAS. And then I also
                    managed a grant to the Harvard Population Center.</p>
                <p>But during that first year, I did a lot of reading. I began to familiarize myself
                    with the social science literature in the population field, and I became aware
                    that there was a raging debate going on about demand and how inclined families
                    in the developing world were to limit the number of children they had. There was
                    a landmark article written in 1967 by a Berkeley demographea President of the
                    Population Association of American named Kingsley Davis, in which he had argued
                    that it was very much in the interest of parents in resource constrained
                    settings with no social security system and high infant mortality rates to have
                    as many children as they could both to ensure a supply of labor and a number of
                    surviving children and old age security. I found Davis' arguments very
                    compelling. The more I read articles by sociologists and economists and
                    demographers the more convinced I became that there was much more to population
                    issues and the population policy issue than just putting pills and condoms out
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>This was what basically Ravenholt was pushing. Ravenholt was, in many ways, his
                    own worst enemy. He understood that there was more to population than pills and
                    condoms, but by his own utterances he allowed himself to become a caricature of
                    what he actually believed which is more sophisticated than that. But I don't
                    want to imply that he believed that population funds should be used to create
                    the conditions for smaller families sizes - the indirect determinants of high
                    fertility. He did believe, however, that population funds should be used to put
                    in place delivery systems so that it wasn't just a matter of dumping pills and
                    condoms on countries. He believed that there needed to be mechanisms in place to
                    deliver those pills and condoms to the community and the household level. He
                    didn't have much use for health systems, and he was not willing to wait for
                    health systems to get to the point where they became the service delivery
                    mechanism. And, in many parts of the world, that put him at odds with the health
                    establishment in USAID because everybody in Africa and Latin America believed
                    you could not deliver family planning services except in a context of maternal
                    and child health. Ravenholt believed in an Asia model which didn't depend on
                    health delivery systems but rather moved quickly with free standing systems. He
                    basically didn't believe in clinicbased systems. He wanted to get pills and
                    condoms to the household level in villages bypassing the health system
                    altogether. There are very few places in which that approach has ever worked.
                    But it did work in a few Asia societies including, for example, Indonesia. He
                    believed that it was a good model.</p>
                <p>Views on the beginnings of the population program</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pause a minute and get another running start on this
                        subject. What was your understanding of where this population issue came
                        from and how far back did it go. What is your understanding of how the U.S.
                        became involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SINDING: There is actually a very good book on that subject; two good books:
                    Phyllis Piotrow's “World Population Crisis: The U.S. Response” and Peter
                    Donaldson's “Nature Against Us.” Phyllis takes the story from the mid'50s or
                    even earlier up to the early '70s; Peter picks the story up about that time and
                    carries it up to about 1990. Those two books together tell the story of how the
                    U.S. became engaged in the population issue. But to answer your question, John
                    D. Rockefeller had been an early proponent and pushed the issue. And a man named
                    General William Draper, who had been a decorated World War II hero, was asked in
                    the late '50s by President Eisenhower to do a report on the U.S. military and
                    economic assistance programs. The Draper Report, which came out in 1959, made a
                    major point that unrestrained population growth in the developing world was
                    undermining all prospect of development, and that the U.S. ought to give major
                    emphasis to population in its foreign assistance program. He was measured in his
                    language. It was very clear that he didn't want us imposing population
                    assistance on countries that didn't want it. He was quite clear that we should
                    provide assistance to countries that requested it and so on. But he thought it
                    should be a very substantial part of U.S. foreign assistance. Eisenhower
                    rejected the Draper recommendation; he said in a quote which is pretty close to
                    this: He did not believe “population or family planning was an appropriate
                    subject for the U.S. Government.” So that put the matter to rest. Kennedy didn't
                    want to do anything about population, although there were many in his
                    administration who did raise the issue. But when Johnson became President, he
                    was persuaded, after a year or two, that this was really an important issue.
                    There are couple of things that contributed to that: one is that Senator
                    Gruening of Alaska held a series of hearings on the global population problem
                    which provided a Washington forum of fairly high visibility for leading
                    population advocates to make the point that this was a pressing global problem.
                    And Gen. Draper created the Population Crisis Committee and began to press hard
                    on Congress and the Executive branch. In 1965 Johnson made the decision to allow
                    USAID to include a population line item in the budget for the first time. Then,
                    after that, once the dam had been breached, an enthusiastic Congress pumped
                    money into the program quite quickly.</p>
                <p>So, the Agency began its work in population, and as I mentioned earlier, this was
                    over the fairly strenuous objections and deep concerns on the part of many
                    career professionals that we were pushing host countries into a realm of
                    activity that they were very disinclined to enter. With the exception of a few
                    countries in Asia the vast majority of aid recipient countries were not
                    interested in population and considered it a controversial and difficult
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the U.S. side we have had a lot of controversy since
                        then, but was there no controversy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SINDING: Not much. It was very interesting. I think in the mid and late '60this
                    was the time when Paul Erlich's book “The Population Bomb” came out. There was a
                    fairly widespread consensus in the political establishment that population
                    growth was a major international issue. It was viewed in much the same way that
                    the environment came to be viewed in the '80s and '90s as something we had to
                    pay attention to or it would create very severe long term problems for us and
                    everybody else. It wasn't until well into the '70s and '80s that the question as
                    to whether population deserved so much attention was seriously challenged. There
                    were big challenges to how USAID was approaching the issue; as to whether our
                    strategy was the right strategy. But there was very little question in the late
                    '60s and early '70s when the program was gearing up as to whether this was an
                    appropriate subject for government action. Either that or the opposition had not
                    yet organized, and when it did organize, it really rallied around the abortion
                    issue not around whether population was a serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that hadn't surfaced at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No. Interestingly, when I did my abortion study in North Carolina there
                    was practically no organized opposition. Roe vs Wade in 1973 was what really
                    galvanized the opposition. When the Supreme Court declared abortion a right, the
                    antiabortion movement finally had a rallying pole. But before '73 and during the
                    period we are talking about when support for international population program
                    was developing, it was not that controversial. Likewise on the domestic front,
                    when Title X of the Health and Human Services (HEW) created subsidized family
                    planning services in the U.S., it was not a controversial subject. It was only
                    after '73 that the subject became controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the beginning of the program in
                        USAID.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The build up of the USAID population programand early differences in approaches
                    1970s</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SINDING: I was there during the big build up. There had been a handful of earlier
                    veterans. Ravenholt had real difficulty finding people. And the first generation
                    of population officers were basically Vietnam and public safety program
                    retreads. They were people who had been in the agency and whose jobs had become
                    redundant, in some cases superannuated. Ravenholt offered them the opportunity
                    to go back to school and, in some cases, get masters degrees in public health.
                    And a lot of people took him up on that. They went to places like Hopkins,
                    Michigan, North Carolina, Berkeley, Chicago, Pittsburgh. They got masters
                    degrees and came, as retreads, as population officers. And a lot of them went
                    out to the field and were extremely loyal to Ray because he had, in effect,
                    given them a second life in USAID. Some of them were very good; a lot of them
                    were pretty mediocre officers to begin with and remained pretty mediocre. It was
                    a curious hodgepodge. There were some young hotshots who had come in from the
                    outside; there were some established health officers who really believed that
                    population and family planning were tremendously important, who signed on
                    because they believed in it and always had. And there was this middle category
                    of people who had been doing other things, who saw this as a chance to
                    revitalize their careers and move on. It was funny group of people. But the
                    intensity of their loyalty too Ravenholt was really quite a remarkable thing.
                    Something I never quite understood; I couldn't understand why there wasn't more
                    of a challenge to his thesis or more open debate within the office about whether
                    the approach he was advocating, which was so controversial in the agency was, in
                    fact, the right way to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let's go back to that now and some of the main lines of
                        approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Let me tell you how I got into it, and how I took Ravenholt on because I
                    was one of the few in the Office of Population who was willing to do so. And it
                    is part of the reason I eventually became Director of the Office of Population.
                    I was starting to say that I was reading a lot of the literature on social
                    science and one of things that I was discovering was that there was a real
                    absence of research in developing countries that would be directly relevant to
                    the formulation of population policy. There was very little information
                    available to policy makers in specific countries about both the effect of
                    population growth on development in those countries or about what kinds of
                    population policies broadly defined would likely to be effective in bringing
                    reductions in population growth rates. I was convinced that family planning
                    alone in most developing countries was not sufficient. There was already a
                    literature that suggested that primary education, especially for girls, was
                    crucially important. There was also literature that suggested that employment
                    opportunities for women were important; that lowering infant and child mortality
                    was an important contributor to the decline in fertility. And so I thought that
                    we should develop a project that would support research in developing countries
                    by developing country investigators which would be directly relevant to the
                    information needs of policy makers who were wrestling with the question of
                    whether they should have population policies and what they should consist
                    of.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So I developed a project with the Smithsonian Institution with a small program
                    there called the “Interdisciplinary Communications Program.” It turned out that
                    Smithsonian and the ICP was a very poor choice as a place to locate this
                    project. And a lot of people asked me at the time why did you choose ICP. It was
                    because I was naive. I thought the Smithsonian was a very prestigious place to
                    have this project There was a guy there named M.C. Shelesnyak who was actually
                    it turned out on his last legs bureaucratically and was desperate for something
                    to do and who latched onto this project. But he was a catastrophe as project
                    director. The Smithsonian project was not, in the event, terribly effective or
                    successful, although it did support some very interesting research. It provided
                    grants to some people who subsequently became real leaders in the field. But the
                    express goal of producing research and getting policy changed did not work very
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have support for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Ravenholt was willing to let me do it. I think that, if resources had
                    been more constrained, he would have been much more negative about it. But he
                    was under some pressure in the likes of Bob Muscat and Ron Ridker, Barbara Herz,
                    Alex Shakow in the Bureau of Policy and Program Coordination (PPC), and within
                    his own bureau, both Joel Bernstein and Sam Butterfield who were in TAB at the
                    time [and by the way he was just written a fascinating chapter on the history of
                    the population program in the book he is doing on the history of aid.] Bernstein
                    himself... a lot of the development professionals in the agency were putting
                    pressure on Ravenholt to do things like what I was supporting. So he found
                    letting me do my thing, a relatively easy way of accommodating those outside
                    interests without costing money that he desperately needed for other things. He
                    had more money than he knew what to do with. He suffered me, but it was clear he
                    didn't support what I was doing. He was hoping that...laughingly he would come
                    around every once in a while and he'd knock in my door and say, “Steve, how many
                    population policies have you changed this month?” That was kind of what he
                    thought about the whole thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Anyway one of the things that the Smithsonian project did was to recruit two
                    people who have become important figures in the field. One was a guy named Bill
                    McGreevey. He was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Berkeley who had just
                    been passed over for tenure and was looking for something to do. And the other
                    was a young woman named Nancy Birdsall, who subsequently has had a spectacular
                    career first at the World Bank and then at the InterAmerican Development Bank,
                    and now at the Carnegie Endowment. Bill and Nancy joined the staff there.
                    Sometime in late '73 or early '74, for reasons I can no longer remember, it
                    became important to do a study on the determinants of fertility and the
                    contribution of family planning programs to fertility change around the world. I
                    can't remember whether someone else in the agency had asked for this or why it
                    seemed so important to do this piece of work. I turned to the Smithsonian and to
                    Bill and Nancy specifically, and I said, “would you do a literature search and
                    pull together everything that has been written on this subject and give a kind
                    of stateoftheart review essay on what is known about fertility change and the
                    contributions of family planning to it.” They did produce that paper. It was
                    very reflective of the burden of evidence at the time which was that it was hard
                    to demonstrate that family planning programs were making much of a difference -
                    that most of the fertility change was occurring because of social change,
                    declining infant and young child mortality and improving education levels and
                    rising incomes and so on. To the extent that you could attribute change to
                    family planning, it was a secondary influence. So when this study came out,
                    Ravenholt absolutely hit the ceiling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just the opposite of his views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Absolutely the opposite of his view. The study came out on the eve of a
                    USAID population officers conference in Honolulthe Asia population officers
                    conference in the fall of '74. I was scheduled to present the results of the
                    study at that meeting. The old Technical Assistance Bureau, by that time, had
                    been transformed into the Population and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (PHA
                    instead of TAB), and there was man named Jarold Kieffer who was the head of it.
                    My boss was a guy named Carl Hemmer. I forgot to mention in all this that in '72
                    the Policy Development Division was created as a spin off from the old Analysis
                    and Evaluation Division -Tom Lyons was the chief of it and I was the deputy.
                    Tom, after a year, had gone off to Nigeria as the population officer. He had
                    been a GS employee and was converted and subsequently went to Kenya and died at
                    a very young age of lung cancer. Very tragic; he was a great guy and one of my
                    most important mentors in USAID. But Carl Hemmer had become the chief of the
                    Policy Division; Carl was an economist, and I was his number two.</p>

                <p>Ravenholt saw that I was on the program and had just read the study and forbade
                    me from taking the study to Honolulu and presenting it to the Pop. officers.
                    Carl stood up to Ray in a staff meeting in which Ray was fulminating about this
                    thing. And he said Ray, “this is a good study; some day you will be proud to
                    have supported this study, and it is intellectually dishonest to try to suppress
                    it.” I will never forget that that was key moment in my life. It was the first
                    time that somebody, who was my boss, had actually had the courage to stand up
                    and protect me. It meant a great deal to me that Carl did that. Carl retired a
                    couple years ago, and I wrote a letter (couldn't attend his retirement party) in
                    which I told that anecdote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe this is a good point to ask the question: What was
                        the basis for Ravenholt's view; how did he come to his view? What was it
                        based on; what research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I have actually written about this. In a paper that I am going to give
                    next month at a meeting at Brown University. I think that Ray came to his view
                    in two ways: one which was broadly a reflection of his training and his world
                    view, and the second was a direct result of his exposure to field programs. He
                    was an epidemiologist by training; he had been in the epidemiologic intelligence
                    service of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); the shock troops of the CDC
                    service. He was very much in the tradition of vertical categorical interventions
                    to solve specific disease problems. And Ray saw high fertility as a communicable
                    disease basically; he felt that like any other disease this was a condition the
                    people, who had it, didn't want. And if you provided the appropriate therapy you
                    could prevent it. So he really viewed providing pills and condoms as the
                    equivalent of vaccinations or immunizations against an unwanted medical
                    condition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a presumption that the demand was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The presumption was that the demand was there. The presumption was that
                    this was a condition that those afflicted didn't want. And it was reenforced by
                    the second thing which was an early field visit to India in which, from visits
                    to the villages, he became convinced in interviews with women that this was the
                    case; that, in fact, they did not want to be pregnant all the time; that they
                    were having many pregnancies that they didn't want. And I have to say, although
                    the conventional wisdom in the '70s and certainly in the '60s was that there was
                    high demand for children, history has shown that Ravenholt's instincts in this
                    regard were much more correct than people then thought they were. People largely
                    discounted the preferences of women in favor of the family economic arguments
                    that seem to support the need for large families. But that was male
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a cultural resistance to family size
                        limitations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SINDING: There was all of that sure; there were mothers inlaw with strong
                    pressures on the children to produce children, and there were religious leaders
                    who viewed family planning as contrary to the culture, and there was all this
                    belief of the economists, especially the microeconomists, the socalled new home
                    economics, that rural substance families needed large number of children for
                    basic survival and a basic survival strategy. But Ravenholt's instincts that the
                    women didn't want to have all these children, and they didn't want to be
                    pregnant all the time, were right. What I am saying was essentially a male view.
                    And the women's perspective which was what Ravenholt saw in that visit to India
                    was not widely known at the time and, to the extent it was, it was discounted.
                    The professional opinion viewed Ravenholt as a radical outlier. And I was among
                    those who viewed him that way. I'm getting ahead of the story. In retrospect, I
                    think his instincts were more right than wrong. We will come back to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make your presentation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I don't know how Jarold Keiffer found out about this. I suspect that
                    Carl Hemmer called him. He had a deputy named Harriet Crowley and one or the
                    other of them found that this episode had occurred. Keifer called me at home. I
                    was younearly 30and for the AA to call me at home was an intimidating
                    experience. He said Steve, “I heard what happened today. I want you to get on
                    the plane tomorrow.” This was a Friday, and we were leaving Saturday for a
                    meeting that was starting Sunday evening in Honolulu. “I want you to get on that
                    plane tomorrow. I will see to it that the papers will get there, and I want you
                    to make that presentation. I will guarantee you that Ravenholt will not give you
                    a lot of trouble.” So I went to the meeting; I made the presentation; Ravenholt
                    was in the audience. He immediately stood up at the end of the presentation and
                    started attacking its premises. He believed that he and Jim Brackett together
                    had collected a lot of data which demonstrated that there was widespread demand.
                    I no longer recall what their evidentiary base was, but Ray stood up and said,
                    “this study is not based on the most uptodate information, the latest data. “I
                    know that a lot of the data came from Jarrett Clinton's program in Indonesia and
                    other USAID field program experience. So that a lot of it was service statistics
                    from Asian programs which were showing contraceptive off takes rising rapidly;
                    the prevalence was going up and so on. In fact, it was, and, in fact, the
                    literature that my Smithsonian colleagues had collected did not make use of that
                    information because it wasn't published. At the end of that session, a fellow
                    named Bill McIntyre who was the Population, Health and Nutrition officer in
                    Pakistan, came up to me and said, “I listened to your presentation with great
                    interest.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>There were two Mission Directors at that conferencJoe Wheeler from Pakistan and
                    Tom Niblock from the Philippineand Bill said, you know, Joe Wheeler and I were
                    talking afterward and we wondered whether you would consider coming to Pakistan
                    to work with us on the program. Well, I had been having some conversations with
                    Monica over the course of the last year sort of saying: I don't know whether I
                    am going back to academia or not, but, if I do, I need to do it soon. And if
                    not, we need to go overseas, because, if I am going to make development
                    assistance my career, then I need some field experience. Being a GS employee in
                    USAID, I was beginning to discover, was not wholly satisfying. This thing came
                    out of the blue from Pakistan. I thought that this was a great opportunity; it
                    is a country with an important population problem; it is Mission that wants me;
                    and it has an open mind about some of these issues. So yes, I said that I would
                    be very interested; let me go home and talk to my wife about it. So I went home
                    and talked to Monica. She had a very good job at the National Academy of
                    Sciences; she was study director on one of the NAS committees and was enjoying
                    her career. We had just had our second daughter. The last thing in her mind was
                    to go overseas. But we talked about it over a period of a couple of months, and
                    I guess I wore her down so that by the end of the year we decided that, if we
                    could make it happen, we would like to go to Pakistan. So I got back to McIntyre
                    and Wheeler; Wheeler had actually been part of the second conversation. It was
                    important to me that the Mission Director had said that he would like to have me
                    to come to work there. I didn't know much about Joe Wheeler at the time; it
                    turns out to have been one of the great decisions of my life to go work in a Joe
                    Wheeler mission. Joe has remained a close friend up to the present day. Bill, as
                    I am sure you recall, was killed in the bombing of the Embassy in Beirut a few
                    years later.</p>
                <p>First overseas assignment to Pakistan with the USAID Mission's population program
                    - 1975-1978</p>
                <p>Let me tell how I got to Pakistan. Because Ravenholt had veto power over the
                    assignment of population officers, his considerable skepticism about whether I
                    would be a useful addition to the Pakistan mission had to be overcome. He was
                    very resistant to letting me go to Pakistan, despite Wheeler's and McIntyre's
                    appeals. Finally, I remember a conversation in his office in which - I guess,
                    Carl Hemmer was present; I don't recall who else was there - Ray made me promise
                    that I would conduct what he called a thousand household study, if he let me go
                    to Pakistan. What Ravenholt meant by thousand household studies was
                    demonstration projects which created the ideal service delivery environment of
                    household distribution of pills and condoms. He was convinced that, if you could
                    put that in place, it was possible to demonstrate in almost any setting that
                    there would be a significant level of demand for those commodities. He, in fact,
                    had established in Bangladesh what he called a thousand household study. It
                    became the famous Matlab contraceptive introduction project, which had
                    demonstrated in Bangladesh (which had been East Pakistan) that even in the most
                    backward setting through good delivery of services at the household level you
                    could increase contraceptive prevalence. So he made me promise that I would do a
                    thousand household study.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>We arrived in Pakistan on the 13th of September 1975; I remember because it was
                    my wife's birthday. When we arrived at the Karachi airport, and she saw what she
                    had gotten herself into, she was just beside herself. She thought she knew the
                    developing world from our living in Chile and travels through the Andean region,
                    but she was not prepared for the subcontinent. So we got off the plane in
                    Karachi; McIntire had flown down from Islamabad to meet us. I remember at the
                    Midway Hotel, McIntire took me off by the pool and wanted to start talking
                    business; it was Monica's birthday, and she cried her eyes out. It was one of
                    those moments with these two little kids ages three and five. So that was the
                    beginning of our foreign service career.</p>
                <p>The first thing I did when we got to Islamabad was to go and see the director,
                    actually he was the codirector of the family planning program, he was joint
                    secretarone of the two joint secretaries in charge of the program. A man named
                    Maqbul Sheikh. And I said to Maqbul Sheikh, “Dr. Ravenholt (who he knew) asked
                    us to do what was necessary to carry out a thousand household study, and I would
                    like to talk with you about how to make that happen.” And Maqbul looked at me
                    like I was crazy and he said, “Thousand household study! We are doing a
                    contraceptive inundation program in the whole country.” He said, “We are testing
                    the supplyside Ravenholt hypothesis on a national basis; why do you want to do a
                    thousand household study?” He said, “two years ago, we did the Sialkot
                    experiment in which we inundated the district with contraceptives, and it was on
                    the basis of that experience that we decided to go ahead with the national
                    inundation program, which USAID is lavishly funding.” These are not his exact
                    words, but this was the spirit of the conversation. “So what are you doing
                    coming here; who are you coming in here talking about a thousand household
                    study; it doesn't make any sense.” Well, I made the mistake of not reporting
                    that back to Ravenholt; I kind of let it sit there.</p>
                <p>I meanwhile got busy with all kinds of things in the mission. McIntyre decided
                    that it would be a good idea alongside the mainstream inundation program - and
                    it really was a contraceptive inundation program - that it would be a good idea
                    to have an R&amp;D program that was kind of experimenting at the edges of what,
                    in addition to contraceptive inundation, might be needed to bring down birth
                    rates in Pakistan. And this included consideration of a lot of things that were
                    in the literature and the wind at the time, like no birth bonus schemes, and
                    other kinds of incentives. Ron Ridker and Bob Muscat both had written papers -
                    both economists in PPC - and essays, and there was in the literature the
                    suggestion that there were measures “beyond family planning,” as it was called,
                    that could bring down birth rates to the level that they needed to get to in
                    order for population growth not to be a development problem. So I was designing
                    what was called the “Population Research and Development Project” to create a
                    mechanism for experimenting with some of these things. In retrospect it was a
                    ridiculous undertaking; I mean there was very little capacity in Pakistan to do
                    any research at all, much less highly sophisticated interventionist research of
                    this kind. But I worked away at designing this thing and, meanwhile, became more
                    and more convinced that the contraception inundation approach was not going to
                    work in Pakistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Contraceptive inundation meant importing enormous quantities of pills and
                    condoms, training a cadre of young field officers - young men and young women -
                    who would work as teams going villagebyvillage to introduce contraception. A
                    vertical program completely unconnected to the health system and managed out of
                    Islamabad in a country that was federal in nature, where the provinces were
                    supposed to have the responsibility for the implementation. So it was deeply
                    resented by the health establishment at the provincial level, in fact,
                    undermined. The central government had no capacity to manage anything like this
                    logistically or otherwise. It was a colossal failure. The pills and condoms
                    piled up in the warehouses; many of them found their way into the black market
                    and actually over the border, especially condoms. There wasn't much demand for
                    pills, but condoms disappeared in massive quantities to show up later in
                    Afghanistan and Soviet Union and, in some degree, India. But most of them went
                    over the Khyber Pass and up into Central Asia. I got there in mid '75, by the
                    end of '77, it was clearly understood that contraceptive inundation was a
                    massive failure.</p>
                <p>Joe Wheeler had left in the meantime; he left in the summer of '76 and came back
                    to become the Assistant Administrator for the Near East and South Asia. McIntyre
                    left a year after that. I was in the mission when two things happened
                    simultaneously. First, Dick Cashin came as the Mission Director from Indonesia
                    where he had been highly regarded and a very successful Mission Director and
                    presided over probably USAID's most successful population project up to that
                    point. Second, the nuclear reprocessing issue arose, and all USAID disbursements
                    were frozen. Something else had happened at that time. Monica had worked as a
                    rupee contractor in the USAID mission. Joe Wheeler had put her in for a lateral
                    entry as a direct hire Capital Development Officer. And she was all set to come
                    in as a direct hire, and she had made that a condition of her willingness to
                    return for a second tour. Well, Jimmy Carter imposed a hiring freeze in 1977 as
                    soon as he came into office. The nuclear issue made it impossible to make a
                    credible case for a waiver for Monica, and Cashin didn't like me and didn't like
                    what I stood for. He was a Ravenholt man down the line, and he felt that I was
                    not on board. Ravenholt had written me a letter - Christmas of 1976, in which he
                    accused me of - I'll never forget the phrase - “failing to get my utilitarian
                    wheels on the ground.” That was his terminology. Ray was famous for coming up
                    with these original turns of phrase. I wrote him a letter back angrily defending
                    myself. That letter eventually found its way to Sander Levin and became part of
                    the dossier when he went after Ravenholt - but we are getting ahead of the
                    story.</p>
                <p>So I went back to Islamabad from home leave in summer of '77 with Monica - not
                    having a job and refusing to return to Pakistan, although she would follow a few
                    weeks later. There was a guy on the desk, David Levintow, who basically
                    persuaded Monica that, if she came back and hung in there, they would eventually
                    get her exempted from the freeze. So she agreed to do that. So I was back there;
                    Cashin had said to me he did not want me to work on population; he'd like me to
                    consider becoming the Mission Evaluation Officer. I didn't want to do that. And
                    besides the Pakistan Mission wasn't going anywhere; we couldn't obligate any new
                    money. And there was no job for Monica. But the only way I could get out of
                    there was by exercising my reemployment rights to the civil service. The foreign
                    service was not going to transfer me. I got in touch with friends in Washington
                    and told them I wanted to come back. Ravenholt wouldn't have me. But Joe Wheeler
                    offered me the job of pop officer in the Near East Bureau; Jack Sullivan offered
                    me the pop officer position in the Asia Bureau, and I had three offers from PPC.
                    One to go work with Barbara Herz in her social sector division; one to join the
                    new studies division in the Office of Evaluation, and I can't remember what the
                    third was, but I remember there were five. But under the rules, if I was
                    exercising my reemployment rights, I had to pay my own way home. So we flew back
                    the four of us - Monica had come back and both kids were therat the end of
                    February '78. And I joined the new Studies Division. I can remember people in
                    the Mission and people in Washington asking why in the world would you go to
                    work for PPC when you had the opportunity to go work for a regional bureau. Why
                    would you turn down Joe Wheeler. But I had it in mind to work in a place where I
                    could do something analytic. In retrospect, but maybe I knew it at the time, I
                    needed to get out of my system all of the things I disagreed with Ravenholt
                    about. Q: Before we turn to that, let's finish up on Pakistan. What was your
                    view of what we were able to accomplish in Pakistan? Talk about the Pakistani
                    government and the people you worked with and their attitudes. What was your
                    sense of the environment for carrying out programs?</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SINDING: Both at the level of the society and at the level of the bureaucracy, I
                    thought the situation was pretty hopeless. I can remember going out at one point
                    into the Punjab on a field trip and having a conversation with a farmer. I spoke
                    a little Urdu at the time. I said to him, “How many children did his parents
                    have?” and he said, “six.” And I said, “how many children do you have?” and he
                    said, “six.” And I said “if you could do it over again, would you still have six
                    children.” He said, “Oh, absolutely.” He said, “I need six children.” He said,
                    “I need one son to work with me on my land; I need one son to go to Lahore (by
                    which he meant to get a job and to earn income for the family); and I need a
                    third son in case something happens to one of the other two.” And he said:
                    “Allah blessed me with three daughters.” I said there is the explanation of the
                    six child family in Pakistan; unless there happens to be a change in that basic
                    equation, family planning is never going to be of interest to a guy like this.
                    That was my mindset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk with his wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I did not talk to his wife. Ravenholt had talked with the “wife” and
                    heard a different story. You know, I did believe that there was some demand for
                    family planning, particularly in the urban centers. I didn't think that Pakistan
                    was an utterly hopeless case. But on the other side of it was the complete
                    incompetence of the bureaucracy. They had pursued it down a road which had
                    placed the central government and the provincial government at such loggerheads,
                    so that the system was not capable of producing the kind of delivery system that
                    even would have gotten them to the point where they could have gotten
                    contraceptives out, given the social circumstances. It was a completely inept
                    delivery system.</p>
                <p>I can remember the Prime Minister's wifMegum Nusrat Bhuttat one point went out on
                    a field trip; I think Fred Pinkham had become the AA at this point in the PHA
                    Bureawhich was eventually to come the S&amp;T Bureau. Fred came on a VIP visit
                    to Pakistan, and he went off on a field trip, and, I think, Begum Bhutto went
                    with him. It was then or when Robin Duke camone of the periodic VIP visits that
                    we had. And I remember her commenting with shock when she met with the field
                    workers and she said, “These are kids. What does a child have to tell a
                    Pakistani mother about family planning?” And basically her politician's instinct
                    was right on the mark. That they had the wrong people employed by the wrong
                    agency doing a job that was essentially impossible under the circumstances. So
                    the combination of the resistance to family planning and fertility control, the
                    increasingly conservative religious environment, and a bureaucratic structure
                    that was just inept led me to conclude that the prospects for fertility decline
                    in Pakistan were negligible. When I left, I was very negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the population program was very substantial?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SINDING: It was huge. In the years that I was there Pakistan may have been the
                    single largest USAID population program in the world. Indonesia may have been
                    larger. India had, at that point, closed down because of the IndoPak war of
                    '71'72 so we really didn't have a presence in India. I don't think we had a
                    project anything like the size of the one in Pakistan; except the one in
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mission had bought into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Joe Wheeler had a gambling streak in him; he was willing to try things.
                    He thought let's test the Ravenholt hypothesis. He had an open mind; he was
                    prepared to believe that maybe it wouldn't work. I should add that I was not in
                    charge of the population project. I was responsible for designing this
                    Population R&amp;D project. But there was a population officer by the name Andy
                    Haynal, who was a physician, had been with the Ford Foundation, and was a
                    Seventh Day Adventist; a fervent believer in family planning, who subsequently
                    left the agency. But Andy was the architect and the manager of the population
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: He was a true believer. He believed that if we had been able to
                    effectively implement inundation, that is, to actually get the commodities to
                    the households at the village level that the scheme would work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't happening? So the concept was never
                        tested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: That was Ravenholt's argument always; he said you can't conclude from
                    the Pakistan experience that availability is not the key to use, because they
                    never really implemented inundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: That's one of those imponderables. There were thousand and thousands of
                    villages, and there were tens of thousands of field workers; surely the supplies
                    and the workers were present in some places. But the Pakistan fertility survey
                    was carried out in 1978 - field work in 1977 - and published in 1978, and it
                    showed absolutely no increase in contraceptive prevalence over the period of the
                    inundation project.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>In fact, there is a little bit of a story in the Pakistan Fertility Survey,
                    itself. There was an officer of the Population Planning Division named
                    Nizamuddin He was based in Lahore and became a friend of mine. Nizam had
                    received a Ford Foundation Fellowship to go to get a Ph.D. in population studies
                    at the University of Michigan at the conclusion of the Pakistan Fertility
                    Survey. But he was responsible in the meantime for conducting it. The people in
                    Islamabad, the powers that be in Islamabad, were well aware that the results of
                    the Pakistan fertility survey would essentially represent the verdict on their
                    effectiveness. So the stakes were very high. There was a new Secretary of
                    Population by the name of Zahidi. He was a little guy, less than five feet tall,
                    and a Bhutto henchman and a real thug. Anyway Zahidi understood that the
                    fertility survey was going to be the report card on inundation, and so he was
                    paying close attention to what was going on. Nizamuddin called me up in July of
                    '77 when the temperature in Lahore was 1200 F and said, “I've got the results,
                    could you come down and help me work on them?” So I flew down to Lahore, took a
                    room at the Intercontinental Hotel. Nizam and I sat there for three days in my
                    room poring over the printout of the tables, the raw cross tabs. And it was
                    absolutely clear that inundation was a failure. The desired family size was
                    essentially unchanged; the completed family size was unchanged; the
                    contraceptive prevalence was essentially unchanged. Basically nothing had
                    happened despite this massive expenditure of funds and mobilization of ....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thousand village test was never done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The thousand household study was never done either, right. In fact,
                    Nizamuddin told me that the decision to proceed with the inundation program,
                    which had been ostensibly based on this experiment in the Sialkot district a few
                    years earlier, was taken before the results of the Siakot Study came in. And, in
                    fact, the results from Siakot did not support the decision to go with
                    inundation. The decision was not really based on anything except some hunches
                    about what might work. And it was totally unrealistic in terms of what the
                    public bureaucracy in Pakistan was capable of doing. That was the worst mistake.
                    I think even worse than the mistake of believing that, if you got the pills and
                    condoms into the villages, people would use them was the mistake of believing
                    that you could get the pills and condoms into the villages in an acceptable way
                    to begin with. The Pakistan system was simply not capable; a country that can't
                    deliver the mail is not going to be able to deliver pills and condoms to
                    households under conservative religious and cultural traditions. It was a mind
                    bogglingly inappropriate set of decisions in my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you conclude as the lesson from that
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SINDING: Well, I am going to come to that, because what I went back to PPC to do
                    was directly related to that. But let me anticipate the answer by saying that I
                    think that what Bangladesh did right, and Pakistan did wrong, was to seriously
                    test out ideas before going to the large scale. Indonesia did the same thing.
                    What Indonesia discovered was that what worked in Bali didn't necessarily work
                    in West Java. And what worked in West Java, didn't necessarily work in East
                    Java. What Bangladesh discovered was that just getting the pills and condoms
                    into the villages was not enough, that you had to have trained experienced and
                    trusted field workers at the community level, you had to have a referral system,
                    and you had to have a capacity to deal with sideeffects of contraceptives. If
                    Pakistan had observed those basic rules of testing honestly on a small level and
                    learned from that before going largescale, a lot of pain and suffering and money
                    could have been saved. The big mistake in Pakistan was not actually letting the
                    Sialkot Study be completed and going ahead with a massive inundation program
                    that was highly risky. Taking the risk is one thing, but doing it without any
                    pilot testing I think was irresponsible. Subsequently, Jack Sullivan, when he
                    became the Assistant Administrator for Asia, had the courage to say that - to
                    say that the Office of Population was pushing supplies out in an irresponsible
                    manner - with this full supply mentality. There was enormous pressure on the
                    Mission from Ravenholt in the Office of Population to accept very large
                    shipments of pills and condoms. You were working in Africa at that time, so you
                    may not have been subject to such pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we had it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I remember Bud Prince (Dr. Julius Prince, African Bureau Population and
                    Public Health officer) got it. Bud was very resistant to it. But what you got
                    was nothing like what the Asia missions got. Just enormous pressure to accept
                    the pills and condoms and to test the supply side hypothesis. Partly because
                    Ravenholt had gone out and bought them, and they needed to be put to use.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was a decade later when Africa moved a bit. I can remember visiting
                    Ghana in '74, before I went to Pakistan, and I went out to visit Dr. Fred Sai,
                    at Legon at the University of Ghana Medical School, and Nancy Birdsall was with
                    me from the Smithsonian project. I remember meeting with Bud, and Bud explaining
                    to me why in Ghana, at that time, a largescale family planning program was not
                    in the cards.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SINDING: Right, it was basically an integrated service delivery model that you
                    were testing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Returned to USAID/Washington to the Studies Division of the Bureau for Program
                    Policy and Coordination and developed the Framework for Population Program
                    Strategy - 1978</p>
                <p>SINDING: So I got back to Washington in the Spring of '78, and I went to work in
                    the Studies Division which had been recently established in the new Office of
                    Evaluation. Bob Berg was the director of the office. I think he was an Associate
                    Assistant Administrator in PPC. Alex Shakow was the Assistant Administrator,
                    PPC. There was a fellow from Boston University named Allan Hoben who had been
                    hired to head the Studies Division. He was an Africanist and anthropologist.
                    Allan was confused and never figured out what that job was all about. But that
                    didn't bother me, because I was very clear about what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>I wanted to do a study of family planning program effectiveness. I had very
                    clearly in my head at that point a model and I wanted to commission some case
                    studies, get some country level information and see if this model would work.
                    The model was a very simple one; it was a four cell matrix. On one dimension you
                    had the social setting; and on the other dimension was political will or policy
                    commitment. And, basically, what I said is that, if the social setting was
                    conducive and the political will was there, a population policy implemented
                    through a family planning program could be highly effective. If neither
                    condition was there, you had a Pakistan. And in between you had these
                    intermediate cases. The B cell, in which the social setting was favorable but
                    the political commitment was not there, was typical of Latin America in which
                    you had high levels of education, relatively high levels of income, the social
                    conditions for smaller families, except perhaps in a cultural religious sense,
                    but certainly in socio...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by social conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SINDING: By social conditions I mean opportunities for women, higher education
                    levels for women, relatively low infant and child mortality. Culturally, with a
                    strong Catholic tradition, you, indeed, had some problems. But, basically, I
                    would argue that the Catholic problem was a political problem not a social
                    problem, because at the individual family level, people don't pay much attention
                    to the teachings of the church, at least on contraception. At the individual
                    level, people do what they think is good for them. But the church does wield
                    considerable influence at the political level. And so what you had in Latin
                    America was a social setting which was conducive to fertility decline, but a
                    political environment that was not supportive. In parts of Asia, you had a
                    social setting that was not particularly conducive but very strong political
                    will. That was the case in Bangladesh where you had a government that was very
                    committed. China, Indonesia, where the social setting was perhaps not all that
                    conducive, the political will was sufficient to overcome the social
                    impediments.</p>
                <p>I commissioned studies, carried out some myself, for about twelve countries.
                    Again McGreevey was part of that process, and I wrote a paper; it was Study
                    Number One of the Studies Division. It came out and was called “A Study of
                    Family Planning Program Effectiveness.” It was published by USAID. Bob Berg and
                    I organized a meeting to which we invited all the Assistant Administrators. This
                    would have been the summer of '78; I think you were at that meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was DAA for Africa Bureau at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: We made a presentation of the results, and I laid out this framework and
                    said depending where you assess a country to be in this matrix, the strategy
                    that you would pursue would be quite different. It was the first time that
                    anybody had laid out an alternative to the Ravenholt view that made sense to
                    people who were more broadly working in development. A lot of people at that
                    meeting, including Jack Sullivan, said, “This really makes sense; this is a
                    basis on which we can develop population strategies for countries in different
                    circumstances in our regions.” The Regional Bureaus, in particular, really
                    responded to it. And Jack came up to me after the meeting and said, “You turned
                    me down when I offered you the population position; but would you
                    reconsider?”</p>
                <p>Transferred to the Asia Bureau as the Population Officer; Testing the Framework -
                    1979-1980</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>By this time I had figured out that I didn't have a future in the Studies
                    Division, because having done this study, I couldn't figure out what I would do
                    next. And so I said, “yes, I would be delighted.” So I went over to the Asia
                    Bureau at that point. I used that framework to develop an Asia Bureau population
                    strategy. It was the first regional population strategy. The reason it was
                    possible to do it was because earlier that year or late the previous year the
                    Carter Administration made a decision to remove the special power of the Office
                    of Population. Population became the province of the Regional Bureaus in the
                    same way as all other sectors were. The Office of Population lost its control
                    over assignments and lost its control over budgets. And so the Asia Bureau had
                    its own population budget and completely independent authority. Being in a
                    position, therefore, as the Pop officer to work directly with the missions and
                    not be beholden to Ravenholt was an offer that I couldn't refuse. So with this
                    framework and with the pop strategy for Asia, I really established myself as an
                    independent voice on population in the agency in the region. It was really the
                    only region that was seriously doing a lot on population, a lot of bilateral
                    programming. Sullivan liked me and I liked him; Tom Arndt was the head of the
                    Technical Resources Office and Jim Brady was the head of PHN. It was a very good
                    arrangement for me. I did a lot of work with the missions in the region. The Pop
                    Officers had a little trouble because they were so accustomed to being under
                    Ravenholt's thumb that working with the Regional Bureau independently was a new
                    experience for them. They weren't quite sure what to do; they really didn't want
                    to get on the wrong side of Ravenholt and the Office of Population. But Sander
                    Levin had come in also as the AA for the new Development Support Bureau, and he
                    was determined to clip Ravenholt's wings. Ray became insubordinate - he would
                    not accept Levin's authority - Levin eventually downgraded him and made him a
                    division chief and in a matter of months Ray had made a decision to leave the
                    agency. And so my ascension in the Asia Bureau coincided with the end of the
                    Ravenholt dynasty in the Office of Population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Asia Bureau for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I came back from Pakistan in late February '78; I went to the Asia
                    Bureau around June/July of '78, and I went to the Philippines two years later in
                    the summer of 1980. Betty Boorady, who was head of Personnel, had to approve my
                    conversion back to the foreign service, and I had to endure about an hour
                    lecture from her on why what I had done was wrong in exercising my GS
                    reemployment rights and how, that if I ever tried to pull anything like that
                    again, it would be the end of my USAID career. I listened politely and hung my
                    head, but I never felt that what I had done was wrong. But in the eyes of the
                    foreign service it was inappropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But before we go to the Philippines, did you test out your
                        matrix?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, we got all the missions in Asia to develop country strategies that
                    were in one way or another...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it applied? What countries used it one way or
                        another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: In the Philippines, it was interesting; in the Philippines, we had
                    doubts about the depth of commitment of the Marcos government. The Philippines
                    was a place in which we agreed to work. There was a high demand for family
                    planning services, but a lagging commitment on the part of the government. So a
                    natural thing to do would be to try to work through private agencies. A major
                    effort was made to shift resources from public to NGO channels for service
                    delivery. That's an example.</p>
                <p>I went out to India in '78. We had just reopened a bilateral program, and I went
                    out with a team. We applied the framework in India actually statebystate. There
                    were some states like Maharashtra and Punjab where it appeared that the
                    commitment on the part of government was there and the predisposition to limit
                    family sizes was strong enough, that strong public programs made a lot of sense.
                    There were other states like Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat where it was much less
                    that that was the case, and where we argued in favor of a much stronger private
                    sector approach. Also for Rajasthan, we felt that the social setting argued in
                    favor of major investments in primary education and primary health care along
                    with family planning services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What stood out in most cases: political will or the social
                        context, or was it just too variable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I think the social setting provided the parameters within which
                    fertility could vary and political will largely determined within those
                    parameters whether you were at the upper end or the lower end. But Bangladesh
                    surprised me.</p>
                <p>When I went to Bangladesh for the first time in '7actually this is an aside that
                    is an important part of the story. As I was leaving Pakistan, I had very little
                    to do; the Bangladesh Mission called mJohn Dumm was the Population Officer with
                    Charles Gurney; they were there together. They asked me to come over; they were
                    getting ready to produce a population strategy paper. And I said I would be glad
                    to. So I went over and I spent a week or a weekandahalf looking at the data,
                    traveling around familiarizing myself. I concluded after a very brief and
                    cursory look at the situation but informed by almost three years of experience
                    in Pakistan, that the most that Bangladesh could hope for given the social
                    setting was a contraceptive prevalence rate of 2025 percent by the end of the
                    century under the most favorable political conditions one could imagine. But, in
                    fact, by 2000 Bangladesh had a contraceptive prevalence of over 50 percent. I
                    was proved to be very wrong and, in fact, my experience in Asia led me to
                    believe that, my Pakistan experience notwithstanding, there was a lot more
                    demand for family planning out there than I had believed there was.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The Philippines experience was part of what convinced me about that. But I also
                    took a trip to Indonesia in 1976 where I saw a situation that was completely
                    different from anything I had experienced before with a well managed government
                    family planning program that was determined to bring down fertility - what could
                    be done where political will was really strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: and service delivery was effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was really effective, yes. It really happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This model, you had for the Asia Bureau, worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, it worked well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And each of the missions came in with their own
                        strategies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, you know I wouldn't say it worked perfectly. The missions were
                    still relatively free to do what they were going to do. But I had created a
                    planning framework that made sense to people and which enabled them at least to
                    think about this issue in a more sophisticated way. That set of ideas began to
                    gradually permeate the thinking of the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of pilot efforts to test out ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No, not really. Most of the Asia countries by the time I was in that job
                    were pretty far along. The Thai program was well established. It made a
                    difference in India as I said. We tried to make something go in Sri Lanka. That
                    was an interesting case. Sarah Jane Littlefield was the Mission Director, and
                    she basically didn't want to do anything in family planning. She didn't think it
                    was necessary, because she thought everything was going in the right direction
                    anyway. She was absolutely right. We had a gung ho population officer who really
                    wanted to do stuff. But Sri Lanka was approaching replacement level fertility on
                    its own without USAID's assistance and Sarah Jane knew that. We couldn't work in
                    Burma; Vietnam was, of course, long gone by then.</p>
                <p>Thailand and Indonesia, both had mature programs and I've talked about the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nepal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SINDING: I never visited Nepal, and I still have never visited Nepal. Sam
                    Butterfield was the Mission Director and David Mutchler was the Pop officer. Sam
                    certainly believed that you needed a combination of family planning services and
                    improvements in social services, social setting, the socioeconomic conditions. I
                    think he believed that he could develop a general development strategy in Nepal
                    that would reenforce a small family norm along side the family planning program
                    effort that was underway. But Nepal was basically doing a sterilization only
                    program a la India. And one of the things, I know, that we called for in Asia
                    Bureau strategy was to pay more attention to (a) the underlying determinants of
                    fertility, particularly focusing on girls education and mortality reduction; and
                    (b) a more well rounded approach to family planning with temporary methods along
                    side sterilization.</p>
                <p>Was the strategy really applied in the field? Not in the sense that I laid out
                    the strategy, and then the missions fell into lock step and implemented it. But
                    yes, in the sense that Sullivan bought into it, the Bureau bought into it, the
                    Bureau basically liked this way of thinking about population, and, in a couple
                    of selected cases - the Philippines and India being two that I distinctly recall
                    - we did actually apply the principles of that framework to country
                    programming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It opened up a way to think about it rather than be caught
                        in a rigid mode.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Right, before this happened you found yourself on the Ravenholt side or
                    the other side; there was no other way to be and my framework created a way in
                    which you could work on both sides of the issue simultaneously and
                    intelligently. I must say that I owe a great intellectual debt to Bernard
                    Berelson, who was the President of the Population Council and was developing the
                    same set of ideas at the same time. This didn't come full blown into my head. I
                    had a lot of correspondence and conversations with Berelson. He was writing a
                    paper on the subject just about the same time I was doing this study at USAID,
                    and the two things came out together. I'm sure that I would not have come to the
                    conclusions I did or in as elegant a fashion if it hadn't been for the influence
                    of Berelson, who has always been my intellectual hero in the population
                    field.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SINDING: I was chief of the Population, Health and Nutrition Office in USAID
                    Manila. Tony Schwarzwalder was the Mission Director. He called me up one day
                    asked me whether I would be interested in that assignment. He said he thought he
                    had a good job in the Capital Development Office for Monica. So it was our first
                    tandem assignment. We were very pleased that there was an opportunity for both
                    of us in a large mission. I think both of us had a certain amount of misgivings
                    about working in the Philippines because of the Marcos regime and the very
                    complicated nature of U.S.Philippines relations. But it was good career
                    opportunity for both of us, and we knew that it was time for us to get back
                    overseas. So off we went.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Philippines at that timin
                        general, not just in population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I would say that we arrived kind of at the beginning of the end game for
                    Marcos. It was clear that he had lost his popular support; there were a lot of
                    Filipinos who, in the absence of an alternative, would support Marcos, but the
                    early popularity that Marcos had had as a reforming authoritarian had passed. He
                    was now seen as a reactionary authoritarian, increasingly. The corruption of the
                    regime was widely known; and many of the people around him were disliked. I felt
                    that we were arriving in the Philippines at a time of cynicism, corruption, and
                    a regime that was rapidly losing it legitimacy. Nonetheless, I was very
                    enthusiastic about working on population issues in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, lets focus more on the population, health, nutrition
                        issues that you were moving into? How did you view the situation you were to
                        work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: In the early years of USAID involvement in population in the
                    Philippinethis was preMarcothe government because of the sensitivity of family
                    planning and population issues in the country was very reluctant to adopt a
                    population policy or a family planning program. The result was that a lot of the
                    USAID resources flowed to private nongovernmental organizations of which there
                    were several; some of which were quite effective. And in that early period -
                    thinking back to the late '60s and the very early '70s - contraceptive use
                    increased so rapidly from near zero to about 25 percent in the population of
                    reproductive age, and there was corresponding decline in Philippine fertility.
                    Interestingly, the Philippines was one of the earliest of the southeast Asian
                    countries to experience a fertility decline, before Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think it progressed so well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SINDING: Because it was private, and because, I think, there was a latent demand
                    for fertility control. The Philippines had unusually strong social indicators,
                    very high levels of female education comparatively, and relatively high income
                    by southeast Asian standards. It was before the rapid economic takeoff of many
                    of the neighboring countries. And the social setting was conducive to lower
                    fertility and demand for the means to control fertility, particularly among the
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this fairly widely spread around the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Particularly in the urban and suburban areas, as is usually the case.
                    But it wasn't limited to the urban areas. And there were a couple of very brave
                    pioneers. There was a woman named Fe del Mundo, who opened up a large family
                    planning clinic which gradually spread to other parts of the country. The dean
                    of Asian demographers Mercedes Concepcion, she contributed importantly to the
                    early recognition of population pressures and rapid population growth in the
                    country. The Family Planning Organization in the Philippines was one of earliest
                    affiliates of IPPF. I think a lot of this had to do with the fact that the
                    Philippines was so closely linked to the United States; a lot of American
                    missionaries and others, who were sort of hanging around the Philippines,
                    started these things. There was an early movement that was comparatively
                    effective.</p>
                <p>What happened when Marcos took over was that after two or three years family
                    planning became an enthusiasm of Imelda. She started up things. I used to say
                    that the development landscape of the Philippines was littered with the
                    discarded enthusiasms of the first lady. And nutrition and family planning were
                    two of those. She got private people to put up money, and she established the
                    Population Center Foundation, the National Nutrition Center, and a few other
                    things. They had big palaces, not palaces, but very fancy buildings out in
                    Makati. But, at the same time, Marcos really pushed the government to get
                    actively involved in the family planning. Something called the Commission on
                    Population (POPCOM) was established in the Marcos years.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Initially the population program of the government enjoyed some success, but
                    there were two reasons why ultimately it was doomed to fail. One was that the
                    Philippines followed the pattern of a number of the Asian countries of
                    establishing a population program outside the health service. Like Pakistan,
                    India, Indonesia, and a number of other countries, but, unlike Thailand, they
                    decided - and I don't know why this was, I don't know whether USAID was
                    particularly responsible for this, or whether this was a decision of the
                    Filipinos; I suspect that USAID had a role - they couldn't wait for the health
                    system to incorporate family planning. In any case, even if it did it would
                    probably have had a low priority, and so they had to bypass the health system.
                    In doing so, they created an adversary relationship, and that never went away.
                    That was the first mistake. The second mistake was in shifting the resources and
                    the responsibility from the private to the public sector. In a lot of Asian
                    countries that would have been the right thing to do, but in the Philippines it
                    was the wrong thing to do because it really incurred the wrath of the Roman
                    Catholic Church. It became a matter of public policy and public programs that
                    the church felt that it had to oppose it, and it did but with increasing vigor
                    over the whole period of the Marcos regime. So that by the time I got there in
                    1980, the dialogue between the church and the government was at fairly high
                    decibel level and Marcos had already begun to back away. This became a discarded
                    enthusiasm, and the government was on the defensive.</p>
                <p>One of my predecessors, Lenni Kangas, had carried out a study in the late '70s in
                    which there was the striking finding that there was a very strong inverse
                    relationship between the distance a woman lived from a family planning clinic
                    and the likelihood that she would be using contraceptives. From that Kangas and
                    his colleagues in the government drew the conclusion that the government ought
                    to shift from a clinicbased to a village or outreach system. The national
                    outreach program became the centerpiece of USAID's support for population in the
                    Philippines. Responsibility for the national outreach program was housed in the
                    PopCom, again bypassing the Ministry of Health. PopCom was to work with the
                    local governments to find specific mechanisms, but a huge outreach force was
                    recruited and deployed who answered to PopCom. So that instead of finding
                    existing service delivery mechanisms that were already part of the structure of
                    public serves in the Philippines, they created a new one at enormous expense
                    and, essentially 100 percent underwritten by USAID. I wouldn't say that it
                    didn't work; it wasn't the classic failure that we had in Pakistan, but it
                    didn't work very well. We pushed very hard in spending a great deal of money and
                    nudged contraceptive use up from 25 percent maybe to 2728 percent. It didn't
                    have the dramatic impact that I think Kangas and his colleagues had hoped
                    for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SINDING: Why didn't it work? Well there a lot of reasons why it didn't work. One
                    was that the Philippines made the same mistake that Pakistan made; that is, the
                    workers were basically young college graduates, typically unmarried, who had
                    very little credibility in the villages. Also it depended heavily on whether the
                    local governments were willing to be cooperative and in many cases the local
                    mayors and governors didn't believe in family planning and weren't willing to
                    give it their support. By this time Marcos was no longer speaking publicly on
                    the issue; this is, in part, based on what I subsequently observed in Kenya and
                    also saw during that same period of time happening in Indonesia. Had Marcos
                    spoken out forcefully and publicly and powerfully for family planning, the local
                    government authorities would have recognized this as a high priority and would
                    have given it much more time and effort to it. But they knew that Marcos himself
                    was on the defensive and didn't have much enthusiasm for it; he never spoke on
                    the subject, and he wasn't particularly interested in holding them accountable.
                    And so they put their time and effort into other things. Without local
                    government support, without political support generally, programs of this sort
                    often don't do very well. So I think it was the lack of political support. I
                    left the Philippines after three years convinced that the public sector strategy
                    didn't make sense for that country; this was a country where it would have made
                    a lot more sense to stay with a strategy of working with NGOs and building up
                    the capacity of the NGOs to be the primary source of service delivery, as it had
                    happened, for example, in Colombia.</p>
                <p>The Colombians solved the same problem the Philippines had, which was overt Roman
                    Catholic Church opposition. They established a very large and effective private
                    family planning association with the passive support of the government to permit
                    international resources to support its work. The Church found it much harder to
                    go after a private organization than it would have to go after the government. I
                    think that that kind of a strategy would have worked better and, in fact, in
                    subsequent years that was the way USAID turned in its support for
                    population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time there you were trying to get this
                        national outreach program to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the problems you faced given there
                        wasn't much support; what were some practical issues you had to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SINDING: Well, I think I have mentioned most of them. The bureaucratic
                    organization for outreach was actually quite good. The people at PopCom, who
                    were responsible for it, were young but very energetic, smart people, highly
                    committed, who understood the importance of working with local government
                    authorities, and who put a lot of time and effort in doing it. It was just an
                    uphill battle because of lack of support from Malaca�anthe presidential palace.
                    And the young people were the wrong kind of people for the outreach work. We
                    didn't have big logistics problems. This wasn't the case where we had overloaded
                    the system with contraceptives that weren't being used. It was primarily an oral
                    pill program with some condoms and IUDs. But I think by that time we had gotten
                    a handle on how to estimate demand to make sure that we didn't overstock, which
                    had been a problem in many of the Asian countries in the earlier years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much resistance among the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No, I don't think so. I think that, if the program had itself had been
                    more enthusiastically embraced by political figures at the local level and they
                    had spoken in support of family planning and responsible parenthood, there would
                    have been more of a response. But I'm not enough of a student of Philippine
                    culture to be certain of that. The Philippines is an interesting case. It is a
                    country in which because of socioeconomic conditions one should have anticipated
                    a strong demand for family planning, particularly given the high status of women
                    and so on; at least the high accomplishments of women in educational terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that true at the lower levels of society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SINDING: Well, it was truer than in Indonesia or even in Thailand. Even in the
                    rural areas most Philippine girls had a few years of primary education. The
                    primary education system in the Philippines was very highly developed, and the
                    people had an implicit faith in education; and in fact, there was compulsory
                    primary education. Girls were pretty well educated; there weren't a lot of jobs
                    for them when they finished. Male dominance and machismo were very strong in the
                    Philippines, and that was one of the negative factors. But I also think Roman
                    Catholicism was important. I think the Filipinos internalized the church to a
                    sufficient degree so that church teaching became an important inhibiting factor.
                    Many of them believed that it was a sin to use contraceptives and wouldn't do so
                    for that reason. This was different from Latin America where I think people were
                    inclined to take the teachings of the church with a grain of salt, particularly
                    where they saw the teachings conflicting with their own interests. I think
                    Catholicism was perhaps a more important feature in individual lives in the
                    Philippines than what I had seen in Latin America. But I'm not really enough of
                    a student to be very certain about these things. But I had no other way of
                    explaining why the Philippines performed so much less successfully than its
                    neighbors in family planning. The government didn't do a great job, but it
                    didn't do an awful job. It may not have pushed as hard as Suharto and his
                    lieutenants did in Indonesia, but they certainly pushed as hard as the Thais did
                    at the level of advocacy and public policy. They didn't run the program as well
                    as the Thais. The Thai program was magnificent; it was an integrated program;
                    they delivered family planning through the Ministry of Public Health and gave it
                    high priority. But the social conditions in the Philippines could have produced
                    more of a demographic response to the availability of family planning
                    services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the program countrywide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: There were parts of the south where it couldn't be implemented because
                    of an Islamic rebellion. But for the most part it was in every region and every
                    province. It was certainly throughout Luzon, Sebu, Panay, and large parts of
                    Mindanao and in the smaller islands and provinces. It was pretty much
                    countrywide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said at the beginning that it would have gone better
                        if it had been with the Ministry of Health, but it wasn't but, on the other
                        hand, you implied that that would have been a very slow way to proceed. How
                        did you see that connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SINDING: Let me put it this way. When Ramos came to power many years later and
                    put family planning into the Ministry of Health, he made PopCom strictly a
                    policy and advisory group and gave the Ministry of Health full responsibility
                    for family planning services. The program took off. The health ministry had the
                    capacity, in fact, to do a good job of family planning with appropriate levels
                    of political support. Ramos didn't suffer from the problem that Marcos and other
                    previous presidents has, because he, himself, was not a Catholic, so he was
                    prepared to take the church on an this issues and he did. He was in specific
                    conflict with Cardinal Sin. He didn't worry about being excommunicated. It was
                    in retrospect, I think that it wasn't as stark a problem as it was in the
                    subcontinent where there really wasn't a rural health system. You couldn't wait
                    to build a rural health system in the subcontinent. In the Philippines there was
                    a rural health system, and Marcos could have used it. It is true that family
                    planning will get a relatively low priority, if it is viewed among one of
                    several health service responsibilities of the Ministry. But, if it isn't, if
                    it's made clear that it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and that
                    this is a very high priority, as was the case in Thailand, then being in the
                    health ministry is not necessarily a disadvantage. It can have the great
                    advantages of a delivery system that is already in place. I think that
                    combination of having offered family planning services to the Health Ministry
                    and giving much more responsibility to the private sector than happened after
                    Marcos took over would have produced a much better outcome in the Philippines.
                    Today I think contraceptive use in the Philippines is about 4550 percent; so it
                    is still not up to the level of Thailand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was advertised a lot, and it worked through the Health Ministry. The
                    two key things that needed to happen, did happen. This was after I left. I can
                    claim no contribution or responsibility for any of the good things that happened
                    in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You planted a seed; I'll bet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Well, I talked to people about what I thought; it may be that in a very
                    indirect way I could have had some impact on the next generation of USAID people
                    or even the Filipinos, but I doubt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also mentioned that under your responsibility you had
                        health and nutrition. You had programs in those areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SINDING: We had two big pilot projects in health. Both were efforts to
                    operationalize what was the big health theme of the day which was primary health
                    care. One was called PUSPanay Unified Services for Healtwhich was designed by
                    the late Jake Vanderflugt. It operated on the Island of Panay in the four
                    provinces. And the other was BICOL Integrated Health Services; in Bicol province
                    in the southern tip of Luzon. The PUSH project was very successful in large part
                    because USAID and the central Ministry of Health put a lot of time and effort in
                    working with the local political authorities. Everyone of the governors in the
                    four provinces on Panay Island was committed to PUSH and put real effort into
                    ireal political support; talked to the mayors and local political authorities
                    and encouraged them. It was a highly integrated activity that included the
                    training of barangay (village) workers who in addition to providing a certain
                    amount of promotive and preventive health services at the household level, also
                    were responsible for implementing community safe water supply. It was a combined
                    health services and safe water project.</p>
                <p>I didn't stay long enough to be there when PUSH was evaluated for health impact.
                    But my understanding is that the evaluation was very positive. Years later when
                    Ramos took over the PUSH modeit was not adoptebut important components of it
                    became part of the national health policy in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our input to the program; what did USAID do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: We basically paid all the cost of the training of the Barangay Health
                    workers. Barangay is the Philippine term for village; the village health worker.
                    The Barangay is the lowest administrative unit; it usually refers to a rural
                    municipality or township.</p>
                <p>So we paid for the training of the Barangay Health Workers, the technical
                    assistance that went into the preparation of the curriculum for that training.
                    We provided the first round of medical supplies which became subsequently the
                    responsibility of the Ministry of Health. We paid for the engineering work and
                    the pumps that were involved in the community water supply. That was about it.
                    Exiting facilities were used so we did not construct any. We may have paid for
                    the upgrading of some of the facilities, but that was a minor item. It covered
                    the entire island of Panay. I don't recall the dollar level but it was not an
                    inconsequential program. The Bicol program on the other hand didn't work very
                    well because the political authorities were never behind it. I paid less
                    attention to the Bicol project. I went to Panay countless times; I loved the
                    Panay project and paid a lot of attention to it. We had really good people in
                    the Mission; there was a Philippine doctor named “Dodong” Caputhat was his
                    nickname; Rosendo Calpul was the primary project manager under the leadership of
                    Joy RiggsPerlI think she is still the Director of the Office of Health in USAID
                    here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were technical assistance people on the spot?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SINDING: No, they were technical staff in the Mission in Manila but spent a lot
                    of time in Panay. We didn't have anybody full time on the ground. We monitored
                    the project from Manila, that was in part because the local people were so
                    competent; they were really good. The Governor oIloilo Provincwhose name I no
                    longer remembewas a real driving force. And then his Director of Planning, Alex
                    Umadhay, were real enthusiasts for the PUSH project. And they really put their
                    heart into it. That's what made the difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't have that in Bicol?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No the people in Bicol were pretty weak and not really enthusiastic
                    about the project. The Bicol project never really amounted to much.</p>
                <p>On the nutrition side, the USAID program in the Philippines was famous. The man
                    who had been there for many, many years was named Butch Engleverybody called him
                    Butch. He was an institution in the Philippines; he had been there for 2030
                    years. He had been a professor at Penn State; he was a professional
                    nutritionist. He was the inventor of the “NutraBun.” the Nutrabun was a
                    concoction of various nutritionally wholesome foods which were first developed
                    as an emergency food supply in typhoon situations where villages were just
                    decimated by typhoons. NutraBuns would be sort of dropped in by helicopters.
                    They provided all of the nutrients that an adult required for a 24 hour period.
                    And they were good; they were very tasty; very dense, sweet. So people really
                    loved NutraBuns; they were sort of famous as an emergency food supply. Out of
                    that came a more serious effort to engage in nutrition planning; to do
                    nutritional surveys; to do weight and height measurement of infants and young
                    children to try to identify the extent of under and malnutrition and try to some
                    up with strategies to deal with it.</p>
                <p>Both on the food production side and the compensatory feeding side. We supported
                    the Nutrition Center of the Philippines, called the National Nutrition Center
                    (NNC), colocated with POPCOM in one of these fancy building that Imelda had had
                    built. Beyond that I don't recall much about our assistance in nutrition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The nutrition program had an ebb and flow in the agency;
                        it started before you came and then on an upswing...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SINDING: Marty Forman was a powerful advocate within the Agency for nutrition.
                    And some Mission Directors in some countries accepted that and started nutrition
                    programs. But nutrition, more than any other subject that the Agency took up,
                    fell between stools. You never knew whether to think of it as part of
                    agriculture or part of health. Some people thought that nutrition really is a
                    subset of the general problem of food availability which, in part, is a
                    production problem and, in part, a distribution and pricing problem. Other
                    people felt that targeted interventions through health systems to deal with
                    cases of severe mal or undernutrition was the right way to go. The Agency never
                    really resolved that problem. So nutrition always was kind of an orphan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a minute to the health program: was the
                        populationfamily planning program connected to the health program at all?
                        I'm trying to think about the interaction of the two programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I pushed very hard in the three years that I was there was for the
                    people in PUSH to give a high priority to family planning. But always sensed
                    that they were resistant. Filipinos never say no. One of the first things that
                    you learn when you go to Asia is that “yes” has many meanings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I learned that in Africa, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SINDING: And learning to distinguish between when “yes” means “yes” and when
                    “yes” means “no” is a real art. If I ever learned it, it was late in the game. I
                    thought the advocacy I was giving to family planning was enthusiastically
                    received when, in fact, they said what I wanted to hear and really didn't do
                    very much. Panay is a religiously conservative area. They were worried that, if
                    they pushed forward on family planning, it would jeopardize other things that
                    they were trying to accomplish with the health program. They weren't hostile to
                    family planning, but they never gave it the priority. And Dr. Vanderflugt, who
                    designed it, with whom all of the preproject negotiations took place, had never
                    pushed family planning particularly in the context of PUSH. Population and
                    health were absolutely divided in the Mission. There was a Population Officer,
                    who worked with POPCOM, and there was a Health Officer, who did whatever he did.
                    When I got there I tried to bring the two together. In fact, I recall, at one
                    point, having a conversation with people at POPCOM saying you know, in the long
                    run, it really doesn't make sense to have parallel delivery systems. We ought to
                    be thinking now about ways in which we can integrate. And maybe we could use
                    PUSH and Bicol as areas in which we could experiment with integration; let's
                    have the outreach workers work with the Barangay Health Workers, and see if we
                    can come up with a rational approach. The POPCOM people didn't want to hear
                    anything about that; they were adamantly opposed to working with the health
                    people. The tradition of separation was so well established before I got there
                    that there was very little that I could do about. I blame Tom Niblock for that.
                    Tom was the Mission Director when all this was really organized. It was on his
                    watch and the people who worked for him that this rigid separate between
                    population and health happened. It just became very difficult when I was there
                    to undo this; it really didn't happen until the Minister of Health, whose name
                    was Juan Flavier under Ramos, came into power. Flavier had been the head of the
                    International Institute for Rural Reconstruction in Cavite. It had originally
                    been in Taiwan and moved to the Philippines later on. It was an integrated rural
                    development laboratory. Flavier was head of health and later head of IIRR. He
                    was very much a prointegration person as was Capul, the guy who worked for
                    USAID. And so when Flavier became Minister of Health under Ramos, he basically
                    broke this rigid separation between population and health and began to bring it
                    together. By that time, USAID was more than ready to follow; the Ravenholt days
                    and the days of strict separation in USAID were over as well. It was a different
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that some of the elements of the work in
                        Panay were picked up in the national policy; what were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The Barangay local health workers; having a local health worker who was
                    trained in critical set of preventive and basic curative services. That was a
                    very important part of what was carried over. And in the community water supply,
                    the understanding that to sustain good health you had to have a source of clean
                    water. Those both became part of the national health scheme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For community water supply, were you able create desirable
                        sustainable systems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SINDING: The engineers always thought it was the maintenance; the communities
                    should take care of the wells. In my experience, we recognized that many of the
                    barangays simply did not have the resources to maintain these system on their
                    own. And so there needed to be a capacity on the part of the health system to
                    repair wells when the pumps broke. That was built into the design of the
                    project. The communities had primary responsibility for the maintenance
                    facilities and had some training in doing that but there was a resource that
                    they could call upon within the health program, within the central health office
                    of PUSH to come and repair wells when things went beyond what they could do
                    themselves. The water supply initiatives of the '80s often fell apart over the
                    maintenance issue, which was, in part, financial and, in part, technical. PUSH
                    was designed by people who recognized that issue. The Philippines was a
                    sufficiently advanced economy so that you really could get the communities - and
                    sufficiently well organized at the community level - so you really could get the
                    communities to take responsibility. The Barangay Health Workers were first and
                    foremost health educators; their responsibility was to help families understand
                    what good health behavior meant. They gave lessons in good nutrition,
                    sanitation, and hygiene and they were able to cope with acute respiratory
                    infections; they gave tetanus toxoid; they did the weightforage charting of
                    children. There were a lot of things that they could do to help families both
                    monitor their own health and take the steps the families could take to ensure
                    their health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the hierarchy of supervision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: There was a clinic base of nurses and they were the first line of
                    supervisors of the community workers, and there was a referral system up the
                    line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there community committees for health?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The Barangay Health Workers were selected by the communities through
                    some sort of process of community involvement; they were not just people who
                    were hired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not like the family planning workers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Just the opposite; they were from the community. They were often young
                    reasonably well educated people but different than family planning; they weren't
                    talking about family planning and contraception. They were talking about things
                    that were not sensitive. Whether there was a health committee to which they were
                    responsible in the classic WHO model I don't recall, I don't think so.</p>

                <p>SINDING: It was my least favorite post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Because of the corruption. James Fallows wrote a book a few years ago in
                    which he called the Philippines a “damaged culture.” It was a very controversial
                    book and certainly a controversial term. But there is some truth to what he was
                    saying. The combination of 300 years of Spanish colonialism and 50 years of
                    Hollywood, produced a very strange kind of culture. It was a culture that was
                    not genuinely Asian in some senses. It was heavy influenced by European culture
                    and heavily influenced by North American culture. The Filipinos, in an important
                    sense, didn't know who they were. In addition to that the Marcos regime was so
                    thoroughly corrupt and the U.S. relationship to that regime was so complicated
                    because of our strategic interests that I found it an uncomfortable place to
                    work. I didn't find my counterparts, with some important exceptions, a
                    particularly able or motivated group. I thought that a lot of what we were doing
                    in the Philippines we would not have done had there not been strategic
                    considerations. Certainly the aid levels would not have been as high; the
                    dialogue would have been different. The U.S. was very cosy with Marcos and
                    certainly overlooked human rights abuses and widespread corruption and
                    mismanagement because Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base were so important to
                    us; good relations with the government were important to us. That is not an
                    environment in which it is comfortable to be an aid worker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we pushing hard on the government and people on what
                        we were trying to get done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, it had been. Mission Directors before Schwarzwalder were much more
                    willing to be heavy handed; that wasn't Tony's style. He was much more
                    deferential and wanted to have a genuine dialogue; he didn't want to push the
                    Filipinos around. Also the Ambassador during the time we were there was Dick
                    Murphy, who was a consummate professional and whose style also was a more
                    sophisticated nuanced style. I actually thought that the leadership on the U.S.
                    side was pretty good given the circumstances. But the circumstances were that it
                    was one of the last battle grounds of the Cold War. We desperately wanted to
                    maintain those military bases. There were very powerful indigenous forces in the
                    Philippines that wanted us out. _Marcos was willing to work with us and to allow
                    us to stay. So we were prepared to do whatever it took to maintain a good
                    relationship with that government to avoid the sort of regime that would have
                    probably kicked us out. Eventually it happened, but we only let it happen when
                    it no longer really mattered to us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any pressure directly or indirectly from the
                        Embassy in terms of what you were trying to do that might have had a

                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No, the Embassy was pretty good actually. John Maisto was the head of
                    the political section; I think he is very high up in the State Department; he
                    was a sophisticated guy. The Ambassador was very good and supportive. Murphy was
                    replaced by Michael Armacost who was also good to work with. I do recall that
                    there was one point at which the Embassy asked us to become much more actively
                    involved in reporting on our conversations with counterparts. We refused to do
                    it. Tony communicated in whatever way he did, the unwillingness of the USAID
                    staff to participate in intelligence gathering. That's the only instance that I
                    recall of the Embassy asking us to do anything or behave in a way we regarded as
                    inappropriate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The people in the Embassy recognized how important the population issue
                    was.They were prepared for USAID to be involved in something controversial
                    because it was an important thing to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SINDING: January 1983. Not quite three years; we went out in late summer of 1980
                    and left in the early part of 1983. Monica stayed on until later in the Spring;
                    she actually worked on the ESF program; she worked very closely with the first
                    lady and her people. Marcos had put Imelda and her people in charge of ESF
                    program. She was the Minister of Local Government and something else. A man
                    named Jolly Benitez was her principal lieutenant, and the main counterpart with
                    the Mission. Dennis Barrett, who was the Deputy Mission Director, was the
                    principal guy on the USAID side working on the ESF program. Monica was working
                    mainly on schools; a big school building program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Assignment as Director of the USAID's Office of Population - 1983-1986</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SINDING: I was called back to Washington by Charlie Greenleaf and Rocky Staples
                    to head Asia/TR. I actually was reluctant to leave before the end of my second
                    tour so early into the second tour, but this was a career opportunity that was
                    hard to pass up. They wanted me to head up the principal office in Washington,
                    an Office Directorship on the track to a Mission Directorship. It was the
                    director of the office in which I had been a division chief. I had been feeling
                    for a long time that I wanted the opportunity to move beyond population work; I
                    wanted to work more broadly on development issues. It wasn't necessarily that I
                    had the aspiration to become a Mission Director. I hadn't really trained to
                    become a population officer; I came into the Agency to work on it. By now I had
                    become a career Foreign Service Officer and was interested in development much
                    more broadly, and so when the opportunity came along to head the technical
                    office of the Asia Bureau I thought that this was the right job at the right
                    time, a good career move to extend my horizons. I had all of the technical
                    divisions - agriculture, rural development, health, population, environment.
                    There was separate office for capital projects. There was a Technical Resources
                    office (TR) and a Project Development office (PD) one of the three main offices
                    of the Bureau. So I was part of the Bureau's senior staff. But I was only in
                    that job for ten weeks when I got a call one day from a fellow named George
                    Curlin. George was the Director of the Office oHealth. He said to me that my
                    colleagues in what was then the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Bureau asked
                    him to call to see whether I would be willing to consider being the Director of
                    the Office of Population. My initial response was “no”, but as I began to
                    understand the situation I felt more and more that I had a responsibility to do
                    this. The situation was that Joe Speidel, who had been Acting Director for a
                    number of years was being forced out of that role, because it was discovered
                    that he had coauthored a book in which abortion was mentioned. And now we get
                    into the population politics of the Reagan era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1983?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SINDING: It is the Spring 1983. This must have been mid to late March. The
                    Communications Review Board had been established by the new administration, and
                    one of its jobs was to take a look at everything that USAID did - published,
                    directly or sponsored, to make sure that we were not publishing things or
                    permitting things to be published that were contrary to Agency policy. And they
                    were particularly vigilant on population questions, because there was in the
                    White House and, in to some degree, in the Agency a group of people who had come
                    in with Reagan who were determined to undo what USAID had been involved in for
                    many years on the population front, and who were convinced that we were
                    basically supporting the abortion industry around the world. And so when Speidel
                    was implicated with the abortion movement, Peter McPherson, who was, of course,
                    the Administrator then, came under tremendous pressure to get rid of him. Joe
                    had been told by Nyle Brady, the Assistant Administrator for S&amp;T Bureau,
                    that he needed to find something else to do. The fear was that, if they could
                    not find a career person to take over that job, the White House would find a
                    political appointee. So the Agency with McPherson's very strong support and
                    Brady, in particular, was desperate to find somebody who was not in any way on
                    the wrong side of the abortion issue, but who could be counted on not to sell
                    the program down the river. And I guess my name was one of those that came
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very interesting position for the Administrator
                        not to give in that much to the other forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Peter proved, in my view, to be a hero in protecting the population
                    program from the real wishes of many of the political people around Reagan. I
                    can recall that in 1981 attending a meeting of the International Union for the
                    Scientific Study of Populatiothe highest professional international organization
                    in population studies. They were holding their quadrennial meeting in Manila.
                    While that meeting was going on, the first effort on the part of the new
                    administration to defund the population programs was announced. It created an
                    uproar in the Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>One part of the story in the Philippines that I didn't think of was that we got a
                    Minister of Planning while I was there named Placido Mapa, who was card carrying
                    member of Opus Dei, the right wing Catholic lay organization. And he tried his
                    damndest to destroy the population program, because POPCOM came under the
                    National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) of which Mapa was minister. Mapa
                    had been the Philippine Executive Director of the World Bank, came back to the
                    Philippines as a very esteemed economist and a real catch as far as Marcos was
                    concerned. But he was just death on family planning as a devote Catholic and
                    really tried to kill the program - unsuccessfully, fortunately. He was unable to
                    carry the Cabinet with him, but he did a lot of damage during the time he was
                    there. Mapa came into the Philippines in the early '80s, and Reagan and the
                    very, very, strong antifamily planning Catholic group around him created a lot
                    of problems for me personally in the Philippines and then back in
                    Washington.There were several people in USAID who were part of that group,
                    including the chair of the Communications Review Board, whose name I have
                    forgotten - she was just determined - and Frank Ruddy, who was the Assistant
                    Administrator for Africa was part of that crowd. He was violently opposed to
                    anything having to do with population and family planning. There was a McCarthy
                    kind of environment; real witch hunt atmosphere. You didn't know who to talk to;
                    what you could say to people on family planning. It was a terrible time.</p>
                <p>Anyway I felt that, if I didn't take the job, they might very well put somebody
                    in there who was kind of a Trojan horse for the antiabortion, for the antifamily
                    planning forces. So I took the job with great reluctance. I had a long
                    conversation with Greenleaf and Staples before I did it and in the end they both
                    understood that, even though I had been in TR for a very short time and, I
                    think, very happy with my performance in that short period of time. The Agency's
                    interests were best served if went over. So Bob Simpson came and took over the
                    TR job and did a very good job. Undoubtedly, there were other people around who
                    could have done the job at the Population Office, but, all things considered, it
                    was probably a better use of personnel for me to go back to population at that
                    moment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not caught in any way in having any relationship
                        to the abortion question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: They never found it out. In fact, when I was a graduate student in North
                    Carolina I had done a studwe talked about thaon the passage of the North
                    Carolina abortion law. If anyone had really wanted to go after me, they could
                    have found that and used it against me. Joe Speidel never wrote anything that
                    was advocatory about abortion. So someone could have said,” he was writing about
                    abortion when he was at North Carolina, so forget about him.” Either they didn't
                    find it, or somebody protected me. And otherwise, I certainly am not someone who
                    was identifiably proabortion or an advocate for abortion. You know very few of
                    us were. But they also wanted somebody who had a reputation for independence,
                    independence from Ravenholt, from the old population side. I think the real
                    reason they came to me was that I had that reputation. People were not going to
                    say, “ Oh, he is just Ravenholt in another guise.”</p>

                    rather than a hard driving family planning orientation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: which was more satisfactory to the administration...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I think so. But I know that when I took over it was not at all clear
                    that McPherson saw population as anything but a problem for him. There was no
                    evidence that he thought that what the Agency was doing in population was either
                    important or valuable. So one of my first priorities was to try to do briefings
                    for the Administrator on what we were actually doing. I thought it was really
                    important for him to understand what the program was all about so that he could
                    defend us more effectively when, inevitably, questions arose about our program.
                    There was a lot of misunderstanding of what was going on. You remember Kate
                    Semmerashe was Head of Public Relations; she was one of those people who had
                    come in as a political appointee and who had all kinds of misconceptions about
                    what the population program in USAID was all about. And once she understood what
                    it was about, she became a great ally. Jay Morris, the Deputy Administrator, was
                    the same way. So I asked Nyle Brady whether he would arrange with Peter for a
                    briefing. What we decided to do was a series of briefings on Saturday morning,
                    when Peter wasn't being called to the telephone and to meetings all the time. He
                    really had some time to sit and talk; I think we did two or three of these
                    Saturday morning sessions where I would bring always Duff Gillepsie, who was my
                    deputy and, depending on the subject matter, one or two other people from the
                    office. We did a half hour of basic factual background - giving Peter facts
                    about the program - and, then, we would just talk with questions; these went on
                    twothree hours. And at the end of that I felt that not only did he really
                    understand what we were about but he supported it. He believed that this was in
                    fact a very viable program. I don't think he had any idea how big a player USAID
                    was on the global population assistance scene. He certainly didn't have an
                    understanding of how much of our program was based on science and research; he
                    had no idea how much work we were doing on demographic date collection and
                    analysis and the service that this was providing globally; the relationships
                    that we had with the UN Population Program and with the Population Council and
                    with the other big players in the field. He came to understand over the course
                    of those briefings what a central role USAID played in the global population
                    game. So I thought that was one of the most important things that I did. Looking
                    back on it, Duff said not too many months ago, that he thought of all the things
                    that happened during my brief tenure as Director of the Office of Population,
                    winning over McPherson was the most important. And given the sensitivity of
                    population and its high profile within the administration that was probably
                    true. If the Administrator had not understood and become an ally and defender of
                    the program, it would have very likely been dismantled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other people engaged in those meetings, some of
                        the other people who were more hostile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Dick Derham, who was head of PPC, and, who was very much a right wing
                    ideologue. I never trusted Derham. I think that started when John Bolton was
                    head of PPC. The Regional AAs were not there. Tom Rollis, he was the management
                    guy, and Peter trusted him; he may have been there for one or two of the
                    sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything about their reactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I particularly remember that Kate Semmerad came around. Jay Morris sat
                    in on some of them. You remember Peter created that Councelor job, and it was
                    always a senior career person. Whoever was the Councelor was part of the
                    conversations. Nyle Brady (AA/S&amp;T) was always there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a great deal of questioning from them or did
                        they hold back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No, it was Peter's show; they held back. But they learned a lot; they
                    absorbed it. Another thing I remember doing, maybe a year later: there was a lot
                    of skepticism, particularly on the part of some of the budget people about all
                    the money that we were putting into social science research: why not put the
                    money directly into services; why not put the money out to the Missions? I
                    organized a briefing where the President of the Population Council, George
                    Zeidenstein; Peter Mauldin the Rockefeller Foundation; Professor Ronald
                    Freedman, Professor of Sociology and Demography at the University of Michigan,-
                    major names in the field - they came and did a halfday briefing for Brady.
                    McPherson came for some of it, and all of the AAs. It was on the contribution of
                    USAID's support of social science research to international population programs.
                    Again it was one of those learning experiences where it built support within the
                    Agency for the program, and what we were doing. In retrospect, it was another
                    important event.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I don't know whether I talked last time about how much I learned from Joe Wheeler
                    about management. Another thing I did at the Office of Population, something I
                    learned from Joe Wheeler in the Pakistan Mission, was to institute as a
                    management technique a weekly meeting with each of the divisions. The agenda was
                    set by the division chief and his or her staff. The meetings were held on their
                    turf. The idea was that it was their hour a week with the Director to talk about
                    whatever they wanted to talk about. In the Pakistan Mission I was impressed with
                    how important it was to me as a young officer to have access to the Mission
                    Director on a weekly basis, to hear what was on his mind, to have the
                    opportunity to tell him what was on mine. I thought to myself that was a really
                    important thing for management to do in those kinds of settings. Joe called them
                    a minicaucus, which I thought was a highfalutin' term so I just I called them
                    weekly staff meetings with the Director's office. Duff came to most of them, and
                    later on we had an Associate Director who came. But mainly it was my opportunity
                    oneonone to meet, and I told the Division Chiefs, as Joe had done in the
                    Pakistan Mission, that if on a given week they wanted to meet with me alone that
                    was fine; we could do it that way, or we could meet with the whole staff. I
                    would say 90% of the time or more it was the whole staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the staff and divisions you are talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: There were six divisions in the office: demography; policy; research;
                    family planning services; commodities and logistics; and information, education,
                    and training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I think we had a full time staff of about 70. It was big office; we were
                    running a budget of $150 million a year and a big portfolio of projects. Unlike
                    the rest of USAID's sectors, population really was divided about 5050 between
                    centrally managed and field managed activities. A big central bureau program. We
                    were not just a central technical assistance office; we were really running big
                    programs of field support and services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do with the program; were you
                        trying to change anything or just carrying it forward or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SINDING: I did not come in with the idea of making wholesale change. For one
                    thing, I thought it was fundamentally a strong program. So I wanted to change
                    incrementally. An important change that I wanted to make was in the style of the
                    office. Ravenholt had ridden roughshod over contractors and grantees. He was a
                    bully; he was domineering. USAID's relationships with its contractors and
                    grantees was anything but a partnership. It was very much a patronclient
                    relationship. And I wanted to change that, particularly with organizations which
                    were in their own right prominent institutions in the field like the
                    International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Pathfinder Fund, the Population
                    Council. I didn't want to treat them like USAID contractors. So one of the
                    things I did was to change the terminology from “intermediary” to what we called
                    “cooperating agencies,” which symbolically was important. And I really impressed
                    on the staff the importance of treating these organizations with respect and
                    trying to develop a mutuality, as opposed to a ustothem topdown, relationship.
                    That is not an easy thing to do, because there is a natural instinct on the part
                    of people who manage money to want to tell those who received the money what to
                    do with it. And that was highly accentuated in the way Ravenholt ran the Office
                    of Population.</p>
                <p>So getting people to change mentalities and think differently about these
                    relationships was not easy. Another thing I did: the Sector Councils had been
                    established a few years earlier; I thought it was very important in consultation
                    with the Sector Council to plan the allocation of central resources,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Sector Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The Sector Councils were interbureau units of technical staff, chaired
                    by the head of the technical office of that sector in the S&amp;T Bureau, but
                    they had on them the representatives of the technical divisions of each of the
                    Regional Bureaus as well as the PPC Bureau. So you had four or five Regional
                    Bureau people, the Office of Population in my case. And the purpose was to get
                    Agencywide consensus on key technical questions. It was Brady's brainchild; it
                    was intended, in part, to increase the power of the technical staff, but also to
                    debate important substantive questions, to create a forum for discussion and
                    debate. The Sector Council reviewed and signed off on projects, on central
                    projects not regional projects. A project could not go forward without Sector
                    Council approval, so the Sector Councils had some teeth. But they were also a
                    place where you could bring issues of the day for discussion and debate. I
                    thought it actually was a very good idea. It created a forum that had not
                    previously existed for the central bureau and the regional bureaus to find
                    common ground and to work together as a team. And it did increase the power of
                    the technical groups within the Agency vis�vis offices, which I felt was
                    important, as the pendulum had swung too far away from technical towards the
                    program side.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Using the mechanism of the Sector Council, I developed something called a
                    resource allocation plan which was an effort systematically to allocate central
                    office resources in a way that responded to field needs as they were articulated
                    by the Regional Bureaus. It was based on a bottomup planning process; not
                    zerobased budgeting, but a system that required each of the technical offices of
                    the Office oPopulation to justify their budget in terms of demand from the
                    Missions and from the Regional Bureaus. In that sense, it sort of anticipated
                    the kinds of changes that came with Brian Atwood of putting much more of the
                    resources out into the field by buying into the central projects. The resource
                    allocation process was something I instituted; it carries forward to this day. I
                    think it was an important innovation in management by objectives and rational
                    resource planning within the office.</p>
                <p>I gave high priority to identifying and preparing the next generation of
                    population officers in Washington and internationally. We developed two
                    projects: the Michigan internship program, which was a program to give practical
                    experience to recent graduates of public health schools and demography programs;
                    it wasn't just summer internships; it was two year assignments to existing
                    programs around the world; and a family planning management training project,
                    which was an effort to identify and give technical training to the next
                    generation of people from developing countries to assume leadership positions in
                    population and family planning work.The World Fertility Survey was coming to an
                    end and under my leadership it evolved into the Demographic and Health Surveys
                    program. I had felt for several years that other parts of the Agency had a great
                    deal to learn from the way the population program had systematically collected
                    data on a global basis to demonstrate impact. We were collecting information
                    that was not only useful for program planning and implementation; we were also
                    collecting information that enabled us to go to the Hill on an annual basis and
                    report on progress: what was actually happening to fertility around the world. I
                    thought that, if other sectors of the Agency could do the same thing, they might
                    be able to build the same kind of political support that we were able to build
                    in population. I thought there was a close relationship between our being able
                    to tell a credible story of accomplishments and the ongoing political support
                    that the program received. This was particularly true when the Administration
                    was hostile and Congressional support was critical to sustaining the program. So
                    that was another programmatic innovation. The reason I called it Demographic and
                    Health Surveys was to try to get the Office of Health to buy into it. And at
                    least to get our sister sector to begin to collect the same kind of information
                    on the health side that we were collecting on the demographic side, to both
                    analyze health needs around the world and to objectify the health situation, but
                    also then, to have a baseline against which to measure change as programs were
                    mounted. So that was another important thing. I have to say that the vast
                    majority of my time was taken up fighting fires, political fires. It was just
                    one thing after another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SINDING: The first was an effort on the part of a woman named, Mercedes Wilson in
                    Louisiana, to get USAID to fund her natural family planning, the Billings Method
                    program. She was part of the virulent antifamily planning and right to life
                    movement. She regarded it as an absolute right to get money from the Agency to
                    support the effort for natural family planning. The Office of Population had for
                    two years stonewalled her on the technical grounds that natural family planning
                    doesn't work, that it is not a method that most people want, etc. She had
                    powerful political connections; she got both to George Bush, who was
                    VicePresident at the time, and George Schultz, the Secretary of State. Somebody
                    from Schultz's office and somebody from Bush's office called McPherson, and
                    McPherson called me up and said give her some money. So we turned ourselves
                    inside out to create a contract that would not be a total embarrassment; but it
                    took hours and hours; very high profile politically; all of the political actors
                    got involved in this. I had to spend many unappetizing hours negotiating with
                    Mercedes Wilson over this project. That was one episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was a terrible idea; I supported my staff, but, in the end, we didn't
                    have any choice. So we tried to create a project that would minimize the damage;
                    in fact, it didn't do much damage. But you know when you have a zealot as a
                    contractor, there was only a certain amount that you could do to control what
                    she does; she did a lot of stuff that we certainly would not, didn't like, but
                    couldn't prevent, including a lot of bad mouthing of other methods. The main
                    thing we wanted to be sure of was that, if she promoted the Billings Method, she
                    didn't do at the expense of other things. But we couldn't prevent her from doing
                    that. For one thing, it was deep within her own belief system; that is why we
                    didn't want to give her money in the first place; we knew that she was going to
                    go out and do that. So that happened. That was minor relatively speaking.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>What was huge, was the Mexico City Conference. In May of 1984, Richard Benedick,
                    who was the Population Coordinator for the State Department with the rank of
                    Ambassador, began to pull together an interagency committee to begin the process
                    of preparing the U.S. position for the International Conference on Population,
                    which was a decennial conference to be held in Mexico City in July of 1984. In
                    fact, it may have been earlier in March or April, but in May, one day I got a
                    call from the Administrator's Office saying that we just got a paper from the
                    White House which we would like you to take a look at. What it was was a
                    wholesale change in U.S. policy - the famous Mexico City policy. The statement
                    began by saying that population was neither a positive nor negative factor but
                    was neutral; that abortion was an abomination, and the U.S. will not support any
                    organization that is engaged in abortion, and that we will defund all
                    governments, NGOs, foreign and domestic, that engaged in abortion. The first
                    thing I said to McPherson: “to say that population is a neutral factor is to
                    completely disregard 20 years of U.S. policy, which is that rapid population
                    growth is a development problem and one that the U.S. is committed to helping
                    countries deal with.” And secondly I said, “I believe that the antiabortion
                    statement not only violates the sovereignty of countries and is inconsistent
                    with our own policy which, at that point, was Roe vs Wade and still is and made
                    abortion legal in the United States, but it also violates the first amendment
                    rights of the American NGOs. How can you tell them that they can't use their own
                    money to engage in abortion promotion and advocacy?” The USAID and State lawyers
                    did wade in and persuade the While House to change that aspect so that it only
                    applied to the foreign NGOs, who were not in a position to defend themselves and
                    had no protection under U.S. law. But that was all that we could change. We
                    couldn't change the statement that population was neither a positive nor a
                    negative factor; that stayed in there. Benedick was required to resign. James
                    Buckley, the brother of William Buckley, by now a Federal judge and former
                    Senator from New York, was named head of the delegation. The delegation was
                    packed with male right wingers; there wasn't a single woman on it; either people
                    who were antifamily planning and antiabortion or people who were kind of
                    economic cornucopias like Julian Simon, who didn't really believe that
                    population was a development problem. It was just a horrible delegation; Peter
                    McPherson was a member of the delegation and I went to Mexico City as his
                    advisor. Peter was himself a prot�g� of Ed Meese. He worked with Ed to soften
                    the statement to the extent it could be softened. But the Mexico City policy
                    statement was written by a former Helms staffer named Carl Anderson, who had
                    come over from the Senate to the Reagan White House and kind of had the
                    international family planning brief as part of his responsibilities. We know now
                    from a book by Carl Bernstein that the Reagan Administration made a deal with
                    the Vatican to oppose international population and family planning efforts in
                    return for the Vatican's support for what we were trying to do in Poland and
                    other Eastern European countries to promote anticommunists and antiSoviet
                    movements. There was an explicit quidproquo there that Reagan was essentially
                    delivering on his commitment to the Vatican and to the Catholic right in the
                    U.S. It was part of a political strategy to win over American Catholics to the
                    Republican party. So that was that. The Mexico City policy basically changed the
                    USAID population policy explicitly for the first time, and that policy change,
                    articulated in 1984, stayed in force until Clinton came in the 1992, so it was a
                    12year period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was its impact on the program, in fact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It was significant. We had to put into every grant and contract a clause
                    under which the recipient of the funds certified that they would not use the
                    USAID funds or any other funds at their disposal to promote or perform abortions
                    as a method of family planning, or which would encourage people to undergo
                    abortion. Most of the organizations with which we worked, including all of the
                    erstwhile intermediaries and cooperating agencies, ultimately agreed to sign the
                    clause. There were two major groups that didn'the International Planned
                    Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America
                    (PPFA); they lost their funding as a consequence; USAID terminated support. PPFA
                    was the largest single granteits Family Planning International Assistance unit.
                    And IPPF was also a very large grantee. So together the cutting off of funds to
                    those two organizations represented a very substantial impact on programs
                    because these were the two largest cooperating agencies supporting family
                    planning services in developing countries.</p>
                <p>Much of the USAID money that IPPF lost was made up by contributions by other
                    donorEuropeans, Canadians, Japanese. But FPIA was unable to find other resources
                    to compensate for what they lost. I worked in close collaboration and
                    consultation with the UNFPA and other organizations to have them support local
                    affiliates of these organizations in countries where abortion was legal, so that
                    USAID funds could flow to their local affiliates. So we tried in a variety of
                    ways to ameliorate the effect of the policy, but it had an unmistakenly chilling
                    effect. It definitely discouraged these organizations from doing anything in the
                    grey areas such as postabortion family planning and research on the consequences
                    of illegal abortion. There were a lot of things that the policy was not intended
                    to curtail which were curtailed, because organizations erred on the side of
                    caution. Guidelines that we put out subsequently helped a bit to indicate what
                    they could and could not do. It had a chilling effect on the international
                    movement; and it had a real chilling effect on the spread of a liberalization of
                    abortion, which many of us in the program believed - the Helms amendment
                    notwithstanding - was very important thing to be done, particularly in cases of
                    widespread illegal abortions, which was one of the largest killers of mothers
                    and women generally around the world. It was unpleasant. And, of course, the
                    signal that the administration was sending was not only its opposition to
                    abortion, but also that it really didn't think family planning and population
                    were very important - “neither a positive nor a negative but a neutral factor.”
                    It was a very major change in the U.S. posture on population as a development
                    issue or even an international issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that follow over into funding and programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SINDING: No, on the contrary. Congress was so enraged by what the administration
                    had done - and it was dominated by Democrats - that they bent over backwards to
                    make sure that the program got more money. We got the largest single year
                    increase in budget between 1984 and 1985 that we had ever received since the
                    very early years when the program was rapidly being built up. From 1974 onwards
                    the trajectory was really quite flat until 1985, and all of sudden it flipped up
                    as the only way Congress could signal its dissatisfaction and anger with the
                    position the administration had taken. There was not a single Congressional
                    member on the U.S. Delegation, which was sort of unheard of. Several members of
                    Congress went to Mexico City on their own and held press conferences to express
                    their disagreement with the administration's position.</p>
                <p>So the United States was portraying itself as a country divided on this question.
                    And, in fact, it was with the 1984 statement that population for the first time
                    became an explicitly partisan issue. Population like much else in foreign policy
                    had been more or less bipartisan and, in fact, much of the leadership for a
                    population program in USAID came from Republicans in the early years, and much
                    of the support had been from the Republican side. It was sort of a conservative
                    issue in some ways. Keeping down the populations of the people “over there” was
                    part of the motivation for the population program. But it was only with the
                    Reagan Administration taking up this very antipopulation position that a
                    partisan division occurred, and it was been with us ever since.</p>
                <p>So these were very dark days. It made it very difficult for me to focus my own
                    attention on program innovations and improvements because I was constantly
                    fighting fires. I spent a great deal of time on the Hill answering questions
                    with the Administrator, offtherecord, on the record, or backgrounds with the
                    press and with a host of the external groups, trying to reassure them, trying to
                    explain the policy, trying to explain where the Agency stood. Peter was very
                    good; he fought as hard as he could while the policy was being hammered out. I
                    was not privy to those conversations; I don't know what he said or what he was
                    able to accomplish in those conversations. But once the policy was in place he
                    was very clear that it has to be implemented properly. He would not brook any
                    monkeybusiness, trying to fiddle at the edges; he was quite firm in making sure
                    that organizations were defunded that would not sign the clause and make it
                    precisely what policy indicated they should do.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Then came China, hard on the heels of Mexico City. In the winter of 1985, a two
                    part series appeared in the Washington Post on China's one child policy and the
                    human rights abuses that were attendant on the implementation of that policy,
                    including some real horror stories about people's houses being knocked down and
                    forced abortions and all kinds of other things. It had an immediate and very
                    powerful effect on U.S. policy. It led directly to the KempKasten amendment to
                    the Foreign Assistance Act which said that the United States would immediately
                    defund any organization which “participates in the management of a program of
                    coerced sterilization and coerced abortion.” It left to the Secretary of State
                    to determine whether a recipient of U.S. funds was participating in the
                    management of such programs. But it was clearly intended to defund the UN
                    Population Program, which was very substantially involved in supporting the
                    Chinese program. McPherson was then faced with the question whether he should
                    advise the Secretary of State to certify the UNFPA was participating in the
                    management of China's coercive one child policy. McPherson tried very hard to
                    find a way to advise that the UNFPA was not substantially involved in the
                    management. But, in the end, whether it was because of political pressure within
                    the administration and from the Hill, or because he believed it, he concluded
                    that UNFPA was substantially involved in the management of that program. We
                    defunded UNFPA under the KempKasten amendment in 1985.</p>
                <p>The right to lifers through the Reagan Administration succeeded now to do
                    precisely what they said they wanted to do, as laid out in an earlier
                    publication of the Heritage Foundation in 1980, namely, defunding the left, in
                    this case defunding the planned parenthood movement and the UN population
                    program (UNFPA). They had specifically said that those two groups were the ones
                    they wanted defunded, and they had succeeded. That happened in 1985, and again I
                    remember working very closely with UNFPA, after the defunding, to see whether we
                    could identify programs that they were funding that we could pick up through the
                    cooperating agencies, or just to make sure that important programs other than
                    the ones in China would not be significantly adversely affected. Because the
                    money that didn't go to UNFPA was available for reprogramming. At that time the
                    UNFPA contribution came through the population budget of USAID. Since that time
                    it has been transferred over to the State Department, so we no longer have the
                    reprogramming authority. What I was able to arrange was to make sure that USAID
                    funds flowed to support programs that would otherwise have suffered. UNFPA
                    identified for defunding those things which we were able to qualify as eligible
                    for our support, and so we were able basically to provide compensatory financing
                    that really didn't disrupt programs. But it was symbolically and politically a
                    severe blow against the program. That was more or less the situation at the time
                    I went to Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With all of the turmoil of the issues you've cited, what
                        was, in fact, the impact on the program on the ground? You talked about the
                        budget going way up and shifting things around so that you were able to keep
                        things going; did the population program come to a halt? Did it accelerate?
                        What happened on the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SINDING: Because population had this unusual history in USAID, from the very
                    beginning, of being out of the main stream, a certain bunker mentality had
                    developed among population staff throughout the agency; we were always under
                    assault for one thing or another from somebody. The assault from the Reagan
                    Administration was unlike anything we had experienced before; everything else
                    paled by comparison. If anything, it brought the population community closer
                    together and it raised morale; we were embattled; but we were in it fighting to
                    the death. There was a sense of common purpose and comradeship both in the
                    Office of Population and across the agency. It was really quite strong. I worked
                    hard to foster that; I worked very hard to keep peoples' spirits up, to say look
                    we are in this fight together; we do have the support of Congress; we have a lot
                    of money, let's use it well and do what we are committed to do. I was something
                    of a cheer leader for the program within the agency as Chairman of the Sector
                    Council and all of that.</p>
                <p>I think programs actually flourished during that period. I think we spent the
                    extra money well and relations with the Missions were good. I was the only
                    foreign service officer who served as Director of Population until last year. I
                    had a very good relationship with the Regional Bureaus which, for most of the
                    office's history, the Pop Office had not had. So there was sense of unity of
                    purpose Agencywide that hadn't been as strong before, I think, and was conducive
                    to good programming and very good relations between the central office and the
                    Regions and Missions. There was a real complementarity and community of
                    interest. I felt very good about the job that we as a group did. When I left the
                    office in 1986, I felt as if I was leaving a fundamentally strong program -
                    politically embattled, yes, but in very good shape programmatically. I got a
                    hero's send off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you did. What was the impact of the U.S. policy
                        turmoil vis�vis the countries themselves as recipients of the family
                        planning programs? Did you get a sense that it galvanized them to do more or
                        no difference at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SINDING: To answer that question, I need to go back to the Mexico City Conference
                    itself and the dynamics and explain what had happened in the population movement
                    generally. At the first Population Conference in Bucharest in 1974, the United
                    States, leading the industrialized group of countries, pushed very hard for
                    demographic targets and population policies and the developing world, led by
                    China, with the support of the Soviets, pushed back very hard, saying no way,
                    you can't push us into demographic policies that we don't think are in our
                    interest. By 1984, the situation changed completely, even Africa had held the
                    famous Arusha Conference in the Spring of 1984, and the vast majority of African
                    Heads oState, at that time, had come to support population policies. So the
                    developing world (and this was in part the result of the good work of the UNFPA
                    and others including us to encourage developing countries to think rationally
                    about the issue of population growth) decided to mount family planning programs,
                    not on ideological grounds but in terms of their own immediate interest. So, by
                    1984, the vast majority of developing countries were onboard with family
                    planning and population as a legitimate sphere of public action. When the United
                    States came out with its completely unanticipated and shocking statement, it had
                    the effect of reinforcing in the developing world their commitment to do the
                    opposite of what the U.S. was saying. Just as we were the odd man out at
                    Bucharest, we were the odd man out at Mexico City, but this time instead of
                    pushing the developing countries away from demographic policies we were sort of
                    encouraging them to go the other way. I think that the United States position
                    actually reinforced the commitment of the developing countries to work in this
                    area, directly contrary, of course, to the Administration's intentions. In the
                    developing world, I think, most of the population officers, once they got past
                    explaining this peculiar policy and explaining the fact that their own
                    government was divided on the question, found an environment in which they could
                    work quite well, quite effectively and the programs really grew. The period
                    following 1984, the latter part of the '80s, was the period of the most robust
                    growth and impact of population programs in the history of the movement. We saw
                    more fertility decline, more rapid decline, more political commitment on the
                    part of the developing countries following the Mexico City conference, than in
                    any other period probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the specific conclusion of the Mexico
                        Conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: The purpose of the Mexico Conference was to review the 1974 World
                    Population Plan of Action and to recommend improvements and changes. So it was
                    not to develop a new international consensus but rather to take stock of
                    progress and make recommendations. What it basically did was to reinforce a few
                    central ideas: one of which was every couple had the right to freely determine
                    the number and spacing of their children and have access to information they
                    needed to do so. So it was to reinforce basically family planning as a human
                    right; secondly, to encourage governments to think about population policy in
                    comprehensive terms not just family planning and health services but in terms of
                    women's education, in terms of employment, and empowerment, and so on; third, to
                    reinforce the notion of volunteerism and individual freedom and the lack state
                    intervention in reproductive decisions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...the lack of coercive sterilization and that kind of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes. Those were the main outcomes, and, I think, strongly to reinforce
                    the notion that the primary mechanism of population policy implementation was
                    through high quality family planning services in the context of health.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was abortion touched on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Only in the negative sense. The conference said that abortion should in
                    no case be regarded as a method of family planning. It didn't say that abortion
                    couldn't be legal, but that it shouldn't be a method of family planning. That
                    would have been the case whether the United States brought the subject up or
                    not. But the big fights at Mexico City were, as they always are at UN
                    conferences, about things that didn't have much to do with the subject at hand,
                    such as the ArabIsraeli conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is excellent. Is there any thing more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: No, I could talk endlessly about those years; the work we did; the kind
                    of things with the Population Crisis Committee, which was the principal lobby to
                    reinforce the views in Congress; speeches I made at the Population Association
                    meetings in New York, talks with other governments and the principal agencies to
                    explain the U.S. position. There was a huge amount going on; I never worked so
                    hard in my life, long, long hours. I really enjoyed the relationship with
                    Administrator Peter McPherson; that was a very important part of the whole
                    thing. And Nyle Brady was extremely generous in not trying to block our working
                    together; he didn't try to interpose himself as long as I kept him informed as
                    to what was going on and didn't try to do end runs. He was perfectly willing to
                    let me work directly with Peter, and he didn't insist on being in every meeting.
                    In some ways, I think, he actually appreciated it, being kept out of it. It was
                    a difficult, trying, enervating time, but it was also, in many respects,
                    exhilarating. I thought I was doing something that really mattered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular projects in the central program
                        that stood out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I mentioned some of them: the demographic surveys, the management
                    training, Michigan fellowships...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those all had good results and impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, and all of them still exist. They were all refunded and refunded.
                    Actually, after I left the agency, I served as a chair of the advisory committee
                    for some of these projects in their later lives.</p>
                <p>One area that we haven't talked about was the support that USAID gave to
                    biomedical research; the search for improved contraceptives. I haven't talked
                    about it because there is not much to say. I think it was an important and
                    worthwhile area to invest in; and I still think so. But it is hard to claim any
                    very major impact or success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: and new contraceptives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Well Norplant. It was a Population Council program, but USAID very
                    substantially contributed to it. That is the only new method that has emerged
                    (other then RU486, the abortion pill, which we didn't get involved in) in the
                    last two decades. An awful lot of leads that we invested in have yet to pan out,
                    although some of them are still alive. But, I think, that we, in retrospect,
                    probably invested too much effort and hope in a public sector contraceptive
                    development effort. If anything, it demonstrated that if you don't have the
                    private sector involved, it is very hard to do anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USAID had a big supply program of contraceptives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: We continued to do that. We bought and delivered a hell of a lot of
                    contraceptives. During the time I was there, we drove the price, the unit costs
                    of both pills and condoms even lower that they had been before. At the lowest,
                    we got down to 17 cents a cycle and even today it is only 2122 cents a cycle.
                    The unified procurement and the methodology that was used to do global estimates
                    to aggregate orders of these enormous quantities was a real accomplishment of
                    the program. That was done during Ravenholt's time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were the principal world supplier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, during the Ravenholt years we were; by the time I got there we were
                    still the world's biggest single supplier but no longer the dominant source.
                    Today USAID is still important, but less a factor. UNFPA has become, on behalf
                    of the community of donors, the largest single source of supplies of
                    contraceptives around the world, and that is as it should be. It is not really
                    right for the U.S. Government to be the primary source. Also as time went on,
                    more and more of the developing countries purchased them themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that covers it pretty well but we can come back to
                        it if you want to add something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SINDING: Maybe as we go on, other things will occur to me. But there was one
                    other area which is actually a good way to lead to Kenya. In 1984, I took my
                    first trip to Africa, and I went to Sierra Leone and Kenya (actually my first
                    trip was in 1974 when I first met you when Bud Prince was there.) I took this
                    second trip later when I was director of the office in 1984, and I visited among
                    other countries, Kenya. And, in Kenya, I saw a private sector family planning
                    program that I really thought was terrific; it was an employerbased family
                    planning program with a USAID contractor. USAID was working with private
                    employers in Kenya to get them to introduce family planning as part of the
                    health services that they provided to their employees. I thought that was a
                    terrific idea; to undertake the analytical work that would persuade employers
                    that it was in their interest from a costbenefit standpoint to provide family
                    planning services, and then to help them set up the delivery system to do it,
                    which was, in many cases, simply adding contraception to other health services
                    that they already provided. Another project that I developed in the Office of
                    Population, before I left, was a global effort to basically replicate the little
                    program I had seen in Kenya - to develop a capacity to assist private employers
                    around the world to provide family planning as part of the health service that
                    they otherwise provided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has it caught on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Of the projects I have mentioned, or the program innovations that I
                    tried to introduce that was probably the least successful. Its lack of success
                    was due less to the concept than the execution; I think we didn't get a
                    particularly good organization to do it. It was a failure of implementation not
                    a failure of concept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you completed your assignment in Washington and
                        left for Kenya; when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>New assignment as USAID Director in Kenya - 1996-1990</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SINDING: I arrived in Kenya in July 1986. The Assistant Administrator for the
                    Africa Bureau at the time was Mark Edelman, who had been a classmate of mine in
                    college. We were never particularly close friends. Mark called me up one day and
                    said, “How would like to be the Deputy Director in Kenya.” I went home and
                    talked to Monica about it. We realized among other things that Kenya was the
                    only country in the world where we could both be assigned and not be in a direct
                    supervisory relationship with one another. So I went back to Mark and said, “if
                    there were a job for Monica in REDSO that might be quite interesting.” Frankly,
                    I didn't view the deputy directorship in Kenya as a particularly attractive
                    alternative to what I was doing, but I also recognized that, as a foreign
                    service officer, it was inevitable that we would have to go back to the field.
                    Kenya seemed like the best opportunity. So I actually called McPherson and said
                    that Mark called me and that we wanted to do it. And he said, “Well, I can't
                    afford not to have you where you are. I recognize that you are foreign service
                    person and have to do this; now is not a good time unless you can come up with a
                    replacement that I can trust.” So we had a long conversation, he, Brady and I
                    about Duff and whether Duff could handle the job and I said I thought he could.
                    So ultimately both Brady and McPherson were convinced. But McPherson said, “Do
                    you really want to go out as the deputy?” And I said. “Well, yes, if I had
                    stayed in Asia/TR, I would have felt that at the end of a three year Washington
                    rotation that I would know enough to go out as a mission director. To be
                    perfectly honest I haven't had exposure to the broad range of things that USAID
                    does. So it would probably be a good thing for me to go out. What I really would
                    hope would be that when Chuck Gladson, who was the Director, leaves I could be
                    considered to become the director.” Mark said, “That sounds like a good idea, a
                    good arrangement to me; I will commit to that.”</p>
                <p>So we were all set to go out, and then one day Peter calls up and says, “How
                    would you like to go out as Mission Director?” “Well, if you put it like that. I
                    would like to do that.” He said. “ I think we need Gladson back here; so that is
                    what we are going to do.” He was bringing Gladson back to be head of the Private
                    Enterprise Bureau, and that cleared the way for me to go out to Kenya as
                    Director. Within the Africa Bureau, Ray Love (Deputy Assistant Administrator )
                    knew me, and I think he thought I was good, and he knew Monica and her work.
                    But, I think, generally speaking there was a lot resentment in the Africa Bureau
                    about somebody who had never worked in the region coming in as director in one
                    of the plum posts, maybe the most sought after post on the continent. There was
                    a big surprise in the Kenya Mission about this guy they had never heard of
                    except as a distant population person. So I think I had a lot to prove when I
                    got to Kenya. The expectation was that McPherson was making a political payoff;
                    and people understood that, but what business did I have being a mission
                    director in Africa? A reasonable question, I might say. I don't blame anybody
                    that held that view. But it turned out okay.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>For one thing, I did not have a tough act to follow; Gladson had established such
                    an adversary relationship with the Kenyan government that there was no where to
                    go but up. And while I think, he was respected by people in the mission, he
                    wasn't loved. So somebody who would come in and pay attention to the staff and
                    be supportive and spend time and listen was a welcome change, especially among
                    the Kenyan staff. So it didn't take me long to win the support of the Kenyan
                    mission, in part because I did again the same thing that I had done in the
                    Office of Population that Joe Wheeler had taught me, which was to establish a
                    management style that made you as much a listener as leader. And, particularly
                    in the first year or two, that approach served me very, very well; it is a great
                    way to learn. If you say I am coming to meet with you and it is your agenda, and
                    then you sit and listen to what people are telling you about their program, it
                    is a wonderful way. Of course, what they will also bring you is their problems.
                    In addition to what is going well and what they want you to know about, they
                    would also say we need your help to meet with the Minister.</p>
                <p>So one of the early things I did was - after I arrived in July 1986 - to go to
                    the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Harris Mule who was a great
                    man. And I said, “I really want to establish a different kind of relationships
                    with you than you had with my predecessor. You will not hear any speeches from
                    me about what Kenya should do. I want to very much conduct our negotiations as a
                    dialogue; to be responsive to your needs, to make suggestions where I think it
                    is appropriate, but basically to understand Kenya's development has to be under
                    Kenyan control, that our role here is to help.” All the things we believe but
                    often don't do. And Harris said to me, “that's music to my ears.” I believe that
                    I conducted the policy dialogue with the Kenyans that way. I had very strong
                    support from the Embassy, at least from the Ambassadors with whom I served -
                    there were three of them. With a couple of exceptions, the mission staff was
                    supportive. Some of the Gladson holdovers really supported the Gladson approach
                    which was hard nosed, stick it to them, never trust the Kenyans. And I have to
                    say that the Kenyans gave you every reason not to trust them. But you know when
                    you are a guest in somebody else's country - even if you are providing
                    assistance - you still have to be deferential to sovereignty. You can't go in
                    there and tell people what to do, even if what you think they ought to do was
                    right. In a four year tour there are four relationships that are really
                    important to a mission director: the relationship with the Ambassador, the
                    relationship with the host country, the relationship with one's staff, and the
                    relationship with USAID/Washington. Those are the four. So in a four year tour
                    there are sixteen possibilities for things going wrong. And, I have to say, in
                    my four years in Kenya I was fifteen for sixteeI had fifteen wins and one loss.
                    My one loss was in my third year with USAID/Washington; I had a rough year with
                    Larry Saiers. But, other then that, for four years I had a exemplary
                    relationship with the government. A superb relationship with all three
                    Ambassadors and a love affair with my staff and in three of the four years a
                    good relationship with Washington. I look back on the four years in Kenya as the
                    highlight of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do programmatically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SINDING: Having made negative comments about Gladson in terms of his operating
                    style, programmatically I had no quarrel with what he was trying to do. It was a
                    very sensible program strategy. So I changed very little. In some ways, I
                    suppose, like the Office of Population, I believed that I had inherited a
                    fundamentally strong program. My job was to try to implement it properly. And
                    where I thought it was not doing the right thing, to make some changes.</p>
                <p>Before I get to what we did, there is one thing I did do that having made the
                    speech to Mule. (And, of course, a speech like that to the Permanent Secretary
                    very quickly gets repeated throughout the bureaucracy - “hey, this new Aid
                    Director is someone we can work with.” It doesn't take long for that word to get
                    around.) Having made that speech, one of my first acts as director was to
                    suspend disbursements under the population program, because the Government of
                    Kenya was reneging on its budgetary commitments. Not long after I got there,
                    Gary Merritt, who was the Population Officer, came to me and said under the
                    Family Planning Services and Support project. (It was biggest bilateral program
                    in Africa and the beginning of what proved to be a dramatically effective
                    assistance program in Kenya.), the Kenyans in the second year were supposed to
                    put up 25% of the funding of salaries and local costs, and it was in the budget
                    - I can't remember the term that was used - but in the first articulation of the
                    1986 budget, the Kenyans had committed to a certain amount money for salaries
                    and recurrent costs. In the final form of that budget that money had disappeared
                    and became a Finland funded hospital in Kakamega District, or at least so we
                    thought. So I went to Mule, and asked him, where was the counterpart? And he
                    said we couldn't do that, so I said then well we can't do it, and I am going to
                    suspend disbursements on this project until you come up with the money to meet
                    the Kenya commitment in our agreement. We were at an impasse for about three
                    months. In the end the people from the Ministry of Health and the population
                    program screamed loudly enough that Mule found the money. So I established both
                    credibility as a partner who wanted to work with them but also someone who was
                    prepared to be tough. I did both of those things early enough on that they knew
                    who they were dealing. It also gave me enormous credibility in the Mission to
                    have done those two things. And, that I had such a great relationship with the
                    Ambassador didn't hurt.</p>
                <p>The other thing that happened was in my second year, Saiers came out as part of
                    an evaluation team. They were doing these Missionwide assessments of program
                    effectiveness, and we got just unbelievably high ratings from that team. I was
                    feeling pretty good about my ability to be a Mission Director.</p>
                <p>What were we trying to do? We had a program with Edgerton University to help it
                    evolve from what had been basically a training program for white farmers into an
                    agricultural university for East Africa by fostering a partnership between
                    Edgerton and the University of Illinois. That was a very successful project. I
                    spent a lot of time working with the ViceChancellor at Edgerton and with the
                    Illinois people. We had a very able Agricultural Development Officer, Dave
                    Lundberg who was succeeded by Jim Gingerich. The both of them were just
                    terrific.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I think the capstone of the Kenya program during my time was the population
                    program. We saw fertility in Kenya drop by the most rapid rate on record from
                    the highest level on record. Kenyan fertility dropped from eight children to
                    five during the time I was in Kenya. It was a marvelous program. It was, in
                    part, effective because of President Moi; Moi really cared about it; he provided
                    the kind of leadership and advocacy and a sense of direction to the bureaucracy
                    that Marcos hadn't provided in the Philippines. I alluded earlier to my
                    experience in Kenya. I think that political leadership in these kinds of
                    situations is crucial, particularly in fairly authoritarian regimes. What the
                    head of state says makes such a huge difference to what people down the system
                    actually respond to, how they spend their time, and how they allocate their
                    resources, and their influence. And Moi made it clear that population was a
                    very, very top priority. He did that in part because the first Ambassador I
                    worked under, Gerald Thomas, was just a fanatic on the subject, the only thing
                    he talked to the Kenyan Government about. He was not a particularly effective
                    Ambassador not particularly well liked, but he really got through to Moi on the
                    population issue.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, the Kenyans under Kenyatta, who had resisted population
                    planning and family planning, came to a realization that, if they didn't do
                    something about this... First of all, they were embarrassed by having the
                    highest population growth in the world. And secondly, they came to recognize
                    that, if they didn't do something about this, the whole place was going to fall
                    apart, as it has. I wouldn't argue that population was the primary cause of
                    that, but it didn't help. Mwai Kibaki, who was the Vice President and the head
                    of the Ministry of Home Affairs, who was an LSEtrained economist, was the
                    primary internal force pressing Moi to work on this issue. But we were there
                    with precisely the right kinds of resources at the right time. We had been
                    supporting two or three private organizations with operations research which
                    proved beyond a doubt that there was a demand for family planning, in large
                    parts of the country, particularly in the central and eastern provinces and in
                    the Rift Valley. That information was extremely reassuring to the Kenyans at the
                    point that they made the commitment of government resources to the program. At
                    the same time, we had helped to build up private service delivery organizations
                    that could work in a complementary relationship with the public sector. Kenya
                    had by far the best rural health service delivery system in subSaharan Africa,
                    except for South Africa. And so there was a system in place into which you could
                    put family planning. It was a combination of a service delivery system in place,
                    high level commitment by the President, a strong complementary NGO sector, and a
                    population that was frankly ready to accept the idea of voluntary fertility
                    control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Ministry of Health role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SINDING: The Ministry of Health had the lead role. We didn't have the problem
                    that we had in Asia of divided responsibilities. There was a National Population
                    Council in Kenya which had policy and coordinating responsibilities. But
                    implementation responsibility was in the Family Health Division of the Ministry
                    of Health; they were pretty good; they weren't great, but by African standards
                    they were pretty competent and quite committed. So the program went well. We
                    went from a prevalence of contraceptives use of 7% in 1978 to about 14% in 1984,
                    and during the time I was there it jumped up to 3638%. And the total fertility
                    rate dropped from eight children per woman to about 5.15.2 between '78 and '89.
                    (I left in 1990.) It has continued along same trajectory since I left. So I
                    think programmatically that has to be regarded as one of our big successes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had some sort of multidonor coordinating
                        arrangement?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, we did. The World Bank, the UNFPA, U.S., U.K., Sweden, Denmark were
                    the principal donors. It was ok; I wouldn't say it was great. We coordinated
                    better in some other sectors and worse in others. Agriculture was a disaster
                    because we believed very strongly that subsidized grain storage and government
                    controlled grain movement, maize in particular, was a bad idea. We wanted the
                    private sector to take over those functions. And the Europeans kept building
                    grain storage facilities and reinforcing the government's tendency to control
                    the movement of grain in the country. That was an area in which we simply
                    couldn't coordinate. In population, we coordinated pretty well. We had terrific
                    coordination on the private sector side where we were supporting a policy regime
                    of liberalization in coordination with the World Bank. We were doing some
                    project assistance that went along with their policy dialogue. They were doing
                    basically policy based structural adjustment disbursements, balance of payments
                    support. And we were providing project assistance to provide technical
                    assistance in the creation of capital markets. We helped create a commercial
                    bankbased small and medium enterprise development program to demonstrate that
                    commercial banks could make money lending to African firms. We did that with
                    Barclay's and Standard Banks. The Kenya rural enterprise program, which was a
                    microcredit program, was really the first microcredit program success in Africa.
                    We did the first health care financing reform project in Africa. That was
                    policy, programbased rather than projectbased assistance with the Ministry of
                    Health. We disbursed against a change in the way the Ministry financed health
                    services, including user payments for certain elective procedures and so on. A
                    gradual shifting from 100% free health care to crosssubsidized health care in
                    which the middle class, which was in a position to pay for certain curative and
                    elective procedures, would provide resources that could then be used to
                    subsidize preventive and promotive health care for the poor. It got off to a
                    rocky start because we didn't make adequate provision for technical assistance
                    in the initial grant, and because a really gungho Permanent Secretary of Health
                    jumped the gun on the reforms and alienated all of the politicians in the
                    country when their constituents came screaming about unanticipated user charges.
                    But, in the end, it proved to be a really very successful and, in Africa, the
                    first successful effort at health sector financing.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So we did a lot of useful things in Kenya, but in an atmosphere of such thorough
                    corruption and deteriorating public administration that it was swimming
                    upstream. The population impact was lasting. I'm not sure that there was much
                    lasting in the impact of the other things we did; they were swept away in the
                    tide of corruption and declining economic performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the difference between the ones that worked
                        the ones that didn't? Was there something inherent in the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I think when fertility starts to decline it is irreversible. It had
                    gotten sufficiently embedded in the social structure so that even incompetence
                    on the part of the Kenyan government wasn't going to stop it. Whereas a lot of
                    the policybased things - capital markets development, health care financing
                    reform, although that, I think, has stuck; some of the things we tried to do on
                    fertilizer subsidies and imports, on grain marketing, and on the whole question
                    of cash crops versus subsistence crops. A really interesting question in Kenya,
                    which was never really satisfactorily resolved, was whether Kenya has sufficient
                    comparative advantage in export agriculture that they ought to stop producing
                    subsistence crops and move toward exportbased agriculture. They have a very
                    limited area of arable land, and the land that is arable is highly productive.
                    The best soil in Africa. They probably ought to be, from a strict economic
                    rationality standpoint, producing high value crops - coffee, tea, export
                    vegetables, flowers - that sort of thing, and using the money to import grain.
                    But that is risky business. There are political considerations that obviously
                    intervened between what would be economically optimal and what...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you judge your experience as a mission
                        director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I thought I was a pretty good Mission Director. I got enough feedback
                    from those who evaluated my performance to think that was justified - the
                    selfevaluation was justified. There was, of course, still a lot substantively
                    that I had to learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in economic supporting assistance,
                        commodity aid at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SINDING: Yes, the fertilizer program was commodity aid, and we had some PL480
                    tied to policy reform. And the money in the health sector was tied to policy
                    reform. And I believed in program assistance and policybased lending. So yes,
                    there was quite a lot of that we were doing. I think that I would have been a
                    better mission director, if I had had better training in macroeconomics. I had
                    some real battles with the Embassy economic staff over macro questions where the
                    roles were sort of reversed. They we taking a hard nosed, hard line approach,
                    which is usually what USAID does with the Embassy usually wanting to just give
                    them the money. And I think I would have been better equipped both to engage in
                    the discussions and perhaps to make good judgements if I had had better training
                    as an economist. I had three very good economists on the staff. Joe Stepanek was
                    the Program Officer and Mission Economist when I got there and Kiert Toh, who is
                    now the Mission Director, was his number two. There was another guy who now
                    works for the IMhis name I've forgottewho was in between the two who was also a
                    really good economist. So I had very good support on the macroeconomic side,
                    but, I think, the lack of training. I learned an awful lot on the job. If I had
                    gone to another post as Mission Director I would have been stronger on some
                    dimensions of policy dialogue than I was. I would have been able to make better
                    judgments and better decisions about what USAID should be doing than I was able
                    to make in Kenya. But I think my management style, my openness, my willingness
                    to listen, my ability to recruit the best people - we had the best mission staff
                    in Africa by general acclaim, my diplomatic skills in being able to work with
                    the host country - when you take all those things together, I was a good mission
                    director.</p>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SINDING: Monica and I sort of knew that, if we were going to continue in USAID
                    beyond Kenya, we would either have to stay in Washington or serve in separate
                    posts overseas. We weren't going to find another situation where we could go,
                    because both of us from now on were going to be mission directors wherever we
                    went. We couldn't both be mission directors in the same country or even a
                    director and deputy. We were sort of agonizing about what we were going to do. I
                    had kind of hoped - I thought I had done a good enough job in Kenya - that I
                    should be a candidate for a Deputy Assistant Administrator job in Washington.
                    But there weren't any forthcoming. I was offered the directorship of Development
                    Planning (AFR/DP) in USAID's Africa Bureau, which is a terrific job which I was
                    happy to be offered, and I was actually assigned to that job. But then I got an
                    offer to go the World Bank as senior population adviser. Monica and I talked
                    about that and decided that would be the ideal solution for her to come back to
                    a position in USAID, to defer for another 34 years the question of what we do
                    when she next had to go out. But she had an office directorshione of the offices
                    in the Asia/Near East Bureau, and I could go to the Bank. I asked USAID for a
                    nonreimbursable detail, a special arrangement under the law that people who work
                    for U.S. Government agencies can work for an international agency and accept pay
                    from that organization at the organization's scale, but still be on the rolls of
                    the U.S. Government. As long as I paid into the retirement system to keep my
                    retirement contributions active, I could become a World Bank employee. So that
                    is what happened, and I became Senior Population Advisor in the Bank at a very
                    high pay - more than I had ever gotten as a government employee. I did that for
                    a year. Then the Rockefeller Foundation offered me a directorship, and, at the
                    same time, Monica was offered a job with the Population Council in New York. She
                    was very unhappy in USAID/Washington; she didn't like the job or the people she
                    was working for. So she left the Agency; she didn't have enough years to
                    formally retire. So we went to New York. She was the Corporate Secretary and
                    Head of External Affairs in the Population Council, and I was the Director of
                    Population Sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation. When I went to Rockefeller, I
                    went on leavewithoutpay and stayed in that status until I reached my 50th
                    birthday, and that is when I retired. I was Director of Population Sciences
                    until June, 1999. And then left Rockefeller to become a member of the faculty
                    oColumbia, and I have been there for the last two years.</p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SINDING: I joined the Bank in July of 1990 on a detail from USAID and remained
                    for exactly one year. I was Senior Population Advisor to the Bank which made me
                    the senior population person at the Bank, advising management and staff on
                    population program issues. I was the principal spokesman for the Bank on
                    population matters. I was hired by a woman by the name of Ann Hamilton who was
                    Director of the Department of Population, Health, Nutrition and Education in the
                    policy and research part of the Bank. Ann was a long time Bank employee, a very
                    engaging woman, very intelligent with experience on both the operations side and
                    the policy and research side of the Bank, although her heart was really in
                    operations.</p>
                <p>We agreed during my first month or so at the Bank that the number one priority
                    was to prepare a new strategy for the Bank in the population field. Ann felt,
                    and I agreed, that the Bank had been somewhat adrift in population since the
                    1987 reorganization which had abolished the old Population, Health and Nutrition
                    Department and sent the population function to each of the regions where there
                    was little leadership and not a clear understanding of what to do. I had been
                    out of population for four years when I joined the Bank and, in retrospect, I
                    think it would have been a good idea for me to have spent as least a part of the
                    first year reacquainting myself with major trends in the field, scientific,
                    programmatic, intellectual, and political, before taking on the strategy paper.
                    But in the event, I felt under considerable pressure from Ann to produce the
                    paper. The Bank didn't have anything like what USAID called its Sector Councils,
                    but as Population Advisor it was my responsibility to try pull the technical
                    people in the Bank together for periodic discussions around issues of common
                    interest. So I was to serve both as a source of scientific and intellectual
                    leadership in the Bank on population and to provide strategic direction. I had
                    just returned from four years in Kenya where I had seen a highly successful
                    family planning program succeed in an environment in which many people believed
                    that family planning could not work because of low levels of social and economic
                    development. A poor “social setting” was widely assumed to make interest in
                    fertility control on the part of most of the population quite low. I was also
                    mindful of the fact that over the same period of time there had been a major
                    breakthrough in Bangladesh, a country which was even less favored by development
                    circumstance to have a major breakthrough in family planning. And both the Kenya
                    experience and the knowledge of Bangladesh had solidified my gradual transition
                    from a skeptic about family planning to a strong supporter of family planning
                    programs in a wide variety of social settings. I still believed that the social
                    setting was a conditioning factor that set broad parameters around how much
                    fertility decline could occur, but I was now much more optimistic and sanguine
                    about what family planning could accomplish even in adverse social settings than
                    had been the case ten years earlier, say, going back to my time in Pakistan or
                    even the Asia Bureau.</p>
                <p>So I felt it was my responsibility at the Bank to bring this information to the
                    attention of managers at all levels within the Bank and to suggest that the Bank
                    ought to substantially increase its lending for family planning and give a
                    higher priority to family planning in its over all programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I wrote a strategy paper beginning in the fall of 1990 and carrying through into
                    the winter and spring in which I tried to educate the Bank as to the changes in
                    thinking that these breakthroughs in family planning represented, and also to
                    strongly encourage the Bank to take much more of a leadership role in policy
                    dialogue on population matters. I felt the Bank, given its access to senior
                    political officials in all of its member countries, was in a unique position to
                    advocate strong population policies and family planning programs. I thought,
                    indeed, that the Bank's comparative advantage was more in policy dialogue than
                    in lending operations in the population field, because, I thought, that many
                    countries were still reluctant to borrow for population and health programs,
                    particularly population programs, but they would be responsive to macroeconomic
                    arguments on the part of the Bank in favor of smaller families and reduced
                    population growth.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I encountered two intense forms of opposition to the message I was putting forth.
                    One was from economists in the Bank who seriously doubted two aspects of my
                    argument: first, they doubted that population growth was a sufficient and
                    important economic variable to justify high priority or visibility in
                    macroeconomic policy dialogue. In other words, they just didn't think population
                    an important enough issue to be high on the agenda. Taking the view of many
                    economists historically, the population issue had been overstated or overblown
                    by demographic enthusiasts in terms of its economic and developmental
                    importance. Secondly, many of them were highly skeptical of the demand for
                    family planning services and, in its most extreme form, this group of economists
                    in the Bank argued that, if people were highly motivated to limit their
                    fertility, they would find ways to do so and didn't really require publicly
                    subsidized contraceptive services to do so. And the fact that fertility was
                    still high was to them evidence of high demand for children rather than a market
                    failure or a lack of access to information and means to limit fertility. In
                    other words, they believed that high fertility was what people wanted. When
                    people didn't want high fertility any more, they would do something about. A
                    program specifically aimed at reducing fertility was not likely to be effective
                    in that framework. So I had a real problem with the economists of the World Bank
                    and the leader of the opposition I was getting was Larry Summers, the Bank's
                    Chief Economist, who later became Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, and then
                    Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton Administration. Summers was a
                    formidable adversary, and one who carried considerable weight in the Bank,
                    although his prestige and influence were certainly far less at that point than
                    they would have been at a later point in his career. Summers was still a bright
                    but, many considered, a brash young academic economist who had just recently
                    come from Harvard and had as yet to establish his bona fides at the Bank.The
                    other major source of opposition to my paper was from a group that I had just
                    not anticipated would take the point of view that they did, reflecting the time
                    that I had spent out in the field. Because in the four years between my stepping
                    down as the Director of the Office Population in USAID/Washington and my coming
                    to the World Bank from Kenya, there had been a major intellectual and political
                    change in the population field. Women's health advocates had gained considerable
                    influence in the political environment of donor agencies and governments and
                    particularly NGOs. They argued that far too much influence had been given to
                    fertility regulation and family planning and far too little attention had been
                    given to broader health, particularly health interventions that affected women's
                    lives. They believed that women had been instruments of demographic policies
                    rather than beneficiaries of broader reproductive health programs, and the
                    emphasis had been too much on population control and not enough on improving
                    women's lives. So there was a backlash that had developed considerable force in
                    policy and political circles that caught me quite by surprise but which was
                    manifest in a quite strong negative reaction to my paper as being overly
                    demographic and insufficiently attentive to the health needs and health linkages
                    of family planning programs, the health needs of women and the linkages of
                    family planning to broader health interventions.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>This latter point of view was, of course, to gain considerably more momentum and
                    eventually dominate thinking at the International Conference on Population and
                    Development in Cairo in 1994. In 1990, it was beginning to develop a head of
                    steam, and I was caught completely unaware of it in my policy paper. In
                    retrospect, had I spent a bit more time getting caught up on currents in the
                    field before I wrote the paper I would have managed to avoid that pitfall,
                    because I was, in fact, quite sympathetic with all but the most extreme versions
                    of the women's health advocacy position. The most extreme version said that
                    there should be no such a thing as demographic policies or population policies;
                    that they were inherently at odds with women's interests and particularly the
                    interest of women's health. Therefore, all family planning should be advocated
                    only in the context of women's health status, not in the context of improving
                    overall economic conditions.</p>
                <p>About the time that the fights were really emerging in earnest about my paper, I
                    was already being courted by the Rockefeller Foundation to move to New York.
                    That conversation began in February and, by the middle of March, I had made the
                    decision to leave the Bank and accept the Rockefeller offer. That decision was
                    highly influenced by David Hopper. David had been a Rockefeller field officer in
                    India, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation and also recently
                    retired as Senior VicePresident of the World Bank. He had been in charge of
                    programs in South Asia and, in his last job at the Bank, had been in charge of
                    the new policy department of which my unit was a part. I asked Hopper, given the
                    option of staying at the Bank or moving to the Foundation, what he would do and,
                    without hesitating, he said go to the Foundation. “You can have far more
                    influence and make much more of a difference from a Foundation base than you can
                    at the World Bank,” where he correctly pointed out, I had no budget or staff, no
                    real resources other than my own persuasiveness. And since I was having serious
                    doubts about how persuasive I was actually being at the Bank given the reactions
                    to the strategy paper, I had decided to take the Rockefeller job. So the last
                    couple of months at the Bank, I was thinking more about my next job than my
                    current job, I did work hard to complete the paper.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>In my last month at the Bank, shortly before I was to leave, there was, in fact,
                    a meeting at the level the President's Council; I can't remember exactly what
                    the phrase was but it was the Bank's senior managemenall the vicepresidents of
                    the Bank who got together to discuss key strategic and policy questions. There
                    was a discussion in the President's officat the time Barber Conable. The first
                    agenda item in the policy councior President's Counciwas my paper, and Summers
                    was there and all of the vicepresidents. There was quite an active discussion of
                    the paper, and, I would say, the balance of opinion was very much on my side and
                    not on the Summers side. Summers scored some points, but, generally speaking,
                    the senior management of the Bank, not the economists but the people at the next
                    level up, were prepared to take on faith my argument that population remained an
                    important development issue and that family planning programs, if not the only
                    way to address population growth, were certainly one of most costeffective
                    interventions, and that the Bank ought, in fact, to do more. Because I was
                    leaving and Summers was staying and population was not high on the agenda, I
                    wasn't in a position to follow up on what I viewed as a sympathetic reception to
                    the paper. I did leave the Bank exactly a year after I had joined it with my
                    strategy paper in a state of limbo. It took the Bank another year to recruit
                    another senior population advisor, and in that time, the whole issue had been
                    caught up in the rapidly accelerating debates that led to the Cairo consensus.
                    So, in many respects, my paper was overtaken by events. I think it was widely
                    regarded as a example of the older and more traditional way of thinking about
                    population questions which the Cairo Conference did much to move beyond. So I
                    would not say, on reflection, that I had a distinguished career, or that I had
                    very much impact at the World Bank. It was a somewhat frustrating time. I
                    certainly felt isolated. The section of the Bank that I was in, because it was a
                    policy and research unit in an institution where all the power lay in the
                    operating regions, was kind of a Siberia within the World Bank. I didn't leave
                    the Bank because I felt I couldn't be effective; I left rather because of the
                    draw of the Foundation. I can't say that my year at the World Bank was a happy
                    one.</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SINDING: Having learned a lot about the Bank during my year there, having
                    observed the Bank at close quarters during all my years overseas with USAID, and
                    having had the opportunity in the decades since I left the Bank to continue to
                    watch its operations, I've drawn some pretty strong conclusions about the Bank's
                    and USAID's comparative advantages. The Bank's comparative advantage clearly
                    lies, if it chooses to exercise it, in policy dialogue; where the Bank chooses
                    to speak out strongly and forcefully on behalf of population policies and the
                    responsibilities of governments to take action in this field, it can have an
                    enormous influence. Governments pay far more attention to Bank than to any other
                    single source of advice outside their borders. And when the Bank speaks,
                    particularly where it speaks persuasively rather than coercively, governments
                    have the tendency to listen and to pay close attention. I think this comparative
                    advantage of the Bank's has rarely been utilized on population matters and
                    almost never since the years when Bob McNamara was President of the Bank, but it
                    is where the Bank has its strongest influence, if it chooses to use it. The Bank
                    is not strong and never has been strong in financing operations in the
                    population field. Governments are, for the most part, reluctant to borrow for
                    the things that matter most in family planning programs, which are recurrent
                    costs. And the Bank is reluctant to lend for recurrent costs, but it is people
                    and services that matter not infrastructure facilities, and the Bank is at its
                    best when it is lending for the latter, and at its worst when it tries to work
                    in the former. I think this is generally true in the social sectors.</p>
                <p>USAID is both potentially and, in many cases, actually more effective than the
                    World Bank because of its field presence, its ability to fine tune, its ability
                    to grant finance, to support recurrent costs where those matter, and to build a
                    transition from external funding to the internalization within the budget of
                    these recurrent costs of its programs and projects. The Bank has a much harder
                    time doing those things, although it does do them from time to time. The Bank
                    also, because it manages its programs from Washington, and because it operates
                    like a bank depending upon the borrower to actually implement a program and
                    taking a very hands off attitude vis � vis the implementation, is not in the
                    position that USAID is in to work in partnership with a country in moving
                    initiatives forward. The Bank's hands off attitude is fine for turnkey and
                    infrastructure kinds of programs, the kinds of things the Bank was established
                    to do in the first place. But the more you get into organic programs,
                    particularly in the social sectors whether it is family planning or education,
                    the more important it is to have people on the ground, to have a collaborative
                    rather than an arms length lending relationship, to try to work through problems
                    together as you encounter them. Technical assistance is terribly important in
                    these programs and governments are reluctant to borrow for technical assistance.
                    So I think the Bank does not have a comparative advantage in the financing of
                    programs and USAID does. And I think the record over the last thirty years very
                    clearly demonstrates that. The Bank has few successes in population lending to
                    point to; USAID has many. The Bank has a few successes in population program
                    policy advocacy as does USAID. I think in a perfect world, a division of
                    responsibilities in which the Bank kind of sets the stage for programs by
                    engaging in advocacy on family planning and population and USAID and other
                    bilateral donors follow though with program support would be ideal. The world
                    doesn't work that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The Bank will continue, I suppose, to lend for reproductive health in the context
                    of broader health lending. And, I have to say, that where the Bank has
                    successfully lent for health in helping to establish rural health services
                    delivery systems often by financing the bricks and mortar and the equipment, it
                    does put in place a system within which it is a lot easier to deliver
                    reproductive health services than where such facilities do not exist. For years
                    the Bank lent for population in Kenya and the Kenyans took the money and built a
                    rural health system and did no family planning at all. But when Kenya finally
                    had a change of heart and adopted a real population strategy, it was extremely
                    helpful to have in place the facilities and the institutions that the Bank had
                    helped to establish through its earlier lending. And I think this argument could
                    be made in a number of other countries where in an indirect way the Bank's
                    lending in this sector did set the stage for more effective field programs than
                    would have been possible in the absence of the infrastructure that the Bank put
                    in place.</p>

                    1991-1999</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now turning to the Rockefeller Foundation, how would you
                        respond to the same questions I outlined for your World Bank
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: There is much more of a story to tell at Rockefeller because I was there
                    eight years and not one. But I can't go on at comparable or proportionally
                    greater length for my Rockefeller experience, so I will try to telescope what I
                    say about that into a few key points. David Hopper was right. Rockefeller was a
                    much better place to be than the Bank in a number of ways. First of all, there
                    was on the part of the trustees and the officers of the Foundation much more of
                    a willingness to accept my basic point of view towards population.</p>
                <p>What I essentially was arguing was that the great need in the world by the early
                    1990s was no longer to invent approaches to effectively reduce fertility; those
                    has been developed through the previous twenty years by intense effort and
                    international cooperation. What was really needed was the mobilization of
                    resources to do what we had learned to do. So resource mobilization to meet the
                    unmet need for family planning, the demand for family planning and thus, to
                    complete the demographic transition was the strategy that I advocated, and that
                    was accepted at the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>This is still 1991; it was three years before Cairo. Some would say today that it
                    was still an old fashioned way of thinking about population, because, while our
                    programs strongly embraced and supported the reproductive health approach and,
                    particularly, some of the more politically difficult and controversial aspects
                    of that approach - namely, working with adolescents and dealing with the issue
                    of unsafe abortions, there was still very much a demographic thrust to the
                    program. I believed then, and I believe now, that the best demographic policy is
                    one which is also the best women's reproductive health policy; that is, to the
                    extent that programs really cater to the needs of women and to the protection of
                    their health, they will also have the greatest impact on birth rates and
                    population growth rates. I don't see the two as being in conflict; in fact, I
                    see these being very strong positive, reinforcing effects between the
                    demographic and the health sides of population and reproductive health
                    program.</p>
                <p>One of the most important things I did at the time I was at the Rockefeller
                    Foundation was to prepare an analysis of the relationships between demographic
                    policies and the demand at the grass roots for family planning. There had been
                    so much argument on the part of women's health advocates that demographic
                    policies were inherently coercive and disrespectful of women and damaging to the
                    cause of women's health that I thought it was really important to look at the
                    question of how much demand there actually was for these services and whether it
                    could legitimately be argued that services had to be forced on populations in
                    order to be demographically effective and successful.</p>
                <p>So I did an analysis in 1992, in which I looked at the unmet need for family
                    planning in countries around the world, by which one means the number of women
                    who are having more children than they want, or whose last birth was unwanted,
                    or whose current pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted, that is, the gap between
                    the number of children that women ideally would really like to have and the
                    number they actually are having in developing countries. Technically, the
                    definition of unmet need is women who know about contraception and want no more
                    children or want to space the next birth and are not using contraception, either
                    because they don't have access to it, or they are afraid, or because some factor
                    external to them is intervening between their desire to use contraceptives and
                    their ability to actually do so like husbands, or mothersinlaw, or community
                    elders. I looked at the level of unmet need around the world and, then in
                    countries for which we had the data, I looked at the demographic targets that
                    were in place. And I compared what demographic policies called for as against
                    what would happen if the unmet need were actually satisfied. What I found was
                    that in all but a couple of the seventeen countries I looked at, if unmet need
                    were fully satisfied, the birth rate would be lower than the demographic targets
                    the countries had set for themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>So what I said in a speech first at the fortieth anniversary of the International
                    Planned Parenthood Federation in New Delhi, and, subsequently in an article was
                    that, if we worried less about targets and more about meeting unmet demand, we
                    could simultaneously satisfy what women want and presumably what governments
                    want in demographic policy. In other words, we could do away with explicit
                    population policy goals simply by meeting the unmet demand for contraception.
                    That argument, while it was disputed in some quarters on technical or even on
                    political grounds, was widely embraced by the political establishment, and
                    particularly embraced by the political establishment in the United States and
                    Europe. The paper was widely read and widely circulated. And I know for a fact
                    that it had a profound impact on the thinking of several of the Scandinavian
                    countries, Holland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It had real impact on the
                    thinking of Tim Wirth, who had become the Undersecretary of State for Global
                    Issues and was really the point person in the Clinton Administration for
                    international population policy and on the U.S. position at the Cairo Conference
                    that occurred two years later in 1994.</p>
                <p>The unmet need argument that I put forward really in may ways became the bridge
                    that closed the gap between the traditional population forces and newly emerging
                    women's reproductive health and health advocacy groups, because up to that point
                    they had really been at loggerheads and it seemed impossible to find a way to
                    reconcile population policy objectives with women's health advocacy. There had
                    been bitter fights. One of the things that stimulated me to write this paper was
                    an extremely angry exchange that I witnessed at a meeting at the Ford Foundation
                    in late 1991 where women's health advocates were saying the most negative and
                    angry and spiteful things about USAID population programs. As a veteran of that
                    program and as a defender of it, I was certainly identified with the old
                    establishment. But the paper I wrote in which I called for dropping demographic
                    targets and embracing the women's health agenda really made a big difference
                    and, I think as I say, built a bridge between the two communities. With all due
                    modesty, I think, it had an important impact on the Cairo Consensus, and, the
                    fact, that there was a consensus at Cairo and a real breakthrough in commitment
                    and in policy.</p>
                <p>Well, my program at RockefelleI only had a budget initially of $14.0 million
                    which grew to $17.0 million a yeawas divided into three parts. One part was a
                    traditional Foundation commitment to trying to improve contraceptive
                    technologies. I hired Dr. Mahmoud Fathalla, an eminent Egyptian OB/GYN who had
                    been the director of the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Program
                    and was a really distinguished global leader on contraceptive research and
                    development. Fathalla led that effort and really under his leadership the
                    Foundation became, I think, the guiding force of new contraceptive research,
                    focusing it on three priorities: postconceptive methods, microbicides and
                    spermicides that would simultaneously protect women against sexually transmitted
                    infection including HIV and against unwanted pregnancies, and research for
                    improve male methods. These were all priorities of the women's health movement,
                    and they made good sense to us also on technical and scientific grounds. Under
                    Fathalla's leadership, the Foundation really did provide a focal point for a
                    renewed effort of R&amp;D in this field. It is today bearing fruit.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>A second major area was resource mobilization. We created a number of
                    institutions including a southsouth partnership - developing countries who
                    became advocates for more resources in the field. We supported a lot of policy
                    research which reinforced the importance of population as a development issue.
                    We also made grants to advocacy groups in the United States and in Europe, and
                    really substantially strengthened advocacy for reproductive health and
                    population outside of the U.S. among the other donor countries.</p>
                <p>The third area was action research in a number of developing countries on these
                    most difficult and sensitive of reproductive health interventions, namely, how
                    to get services to the most important neglected group, adolescents, and how to
                    deal with issues of sexually transmitted diseases and infections and abortion -
                    all areas that are inherently difficult for governments to work on because of
                    their sensitivity and where private foundations have an ability to support work
                    that otherwise might not be done.</p>
                <p>Rockefeller emerged, I think, in those years as a real leadership organization in
                    the population field. Many people, including Tim Wirth, felt that Rockefeller
                    was bringing together people to talk about issues and was providing the kind of
                    leadership through its convening power and its leverage that basically proved
                    David Hopper's point that a small foundation with flexibility and some
                    imagination can really make a big difference in the how the world thinks about
                    important issues. With a staff that included Sara Seims, a USAID veteran who is
                    now President of the Allan Guttmacher Institute, and Jane Hughes, who led the
                    reproductive health action research program and who is now the Population
                    Council's representative in Vietnam, and Cheikh Mback�, an African demographer,
                    who now heads Rockefeller's operations throughout Africa, we had just a stellar
                    group of program officers. I am very proud of the quality of the program that we
                    managed there.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in 19981999 new leadership came in at Rockefeller, a leadership
                    that just didn't feel that population was any longer a key issue. The population
                    program was significantly downgraded under Gordon Conway, the new President and
                    Lincoln Chen, the vice president, to the point where I felt that I no longer
                    really wanted to be associated with it. So in the spring of 1999 I tendered my
                    resignation, and the population program basically withered away after that. Sara
                    went AGI, Fathalla retired, Jane Hughes went to Vietnam and nobody was hired to
                    replace any of these people. So the population program at the Rockefeller
                    Foundation eventually ended around 1999/2000. There are still vestiges of it;
                    some grants are still alive and being played out and the Foundation continues to
                    talk as if population remains an interest, although not a core program
                    objective.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>If one looks at how the Foundation actually spends its money, it is very
                    difficult to say that the Rockefeller Foundation has a population program any
                    longer. I think you can take two points of view on that: one is it is too bad
                    that Rockefeller, which had been a leader in the field for thirty years, had
                    decided to abandoned it; but one could also argue that as a famous Senator once
                    said about Vietnam: “Let's just declare victory and withdraw.” And I think for
                    the Foundation, which likes to be in the vanguard, population was a field in
                    which most of the important discoveries had been made and where it really was
                    the responsibility of governments and much larger organizations to carry through
                    to conclusion the successful start that had been made. It was a legitimate
                    point. I don't gainsay Conway's view that there were more important problems for
                    the Foundation to be focused on in the 21st Century than population and his
                    decision to downgrade population in the overall scheme of things. So I had mixed
                    feelings: some regrets that it all ended rather abruptly, but also an
                    appreciation that in someway the end of the population program at Rockefeller
                    was a sign of the success of the movement, and an indication that the time had
                    come to move to problems that were more pressing than population was in the '60s
                    and '70s when it was one of the most important problems.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back over the years of work with USAID and others
                        and your extraordinarily rich experience and contributions, what are the key
                        lessons about policy, strategy, project design and implementation of
                        population programs in developing countries? What guidance would you pass on
                        those who are planning new programs in this field about what works, and what
                        doesn't work? What's been the impact? You cited some these already so this
                        part can be in the form of a summary or any additional thoughts that you
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: It is true that I have gone on at some length about these things. I
                    think the most important thing that I have learned is that those who doubted the
                    efficacy of family planning programs in the 1960s and early 1970while they had
                    very good reasons to question whether people would be interested in reducing
                    their fertility if contraceptive services were availablwere fundamentally wrong,
                    and that, in fact, the demographers and social scientists of that day
                    underestimated the demand on the part of women to have fewer children. I think,
                    in fact, the field was in those years a very male oriented field; it looked at
                    the value of children from the perspective of a male headed household, not from
                    the perspective of women who desperately wanted to avoid having the sixth,
                    seventh, eighth, ninth child. So we underestimated the demand for family
                    planning. One of the reasons that the programs have been so dramatically
                    effective is because there was, in fact, a very powerful demand on the part of
                    women when they could exercise control over their fertility to do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I think that along with the Green Revolution, population assistance has been the
                    greatest success that USAID has had over the last thirty or forty years, and
                    that these two are among, maybe, the three or four of the greatest successes in
                    international development cooperation. Agricultural research leading to
                    increased food production, family planning, and child survival are among the
                    most successful things that have happened in the development field. I am very
                    pleased to have been a part of it.</p>
                <p>I think I have also learned that policy and political commitment are crucial, and
                    the weaker the social setting the more important they are. In Latin America,
                    where women's status and education levels, and urbanization all got to fairly
                    high levels, all government had to do step aside and acquiesce in the provision
                    of family planning; much of it was done by the private sector and NGOs and
                    fertility would take care of itself. In much of Asia, on the other hand, where
                    the social setting was much less conducive and, certainly in Africa, political
                    will and political commitment are terribly important. And even the advocacy
                    role, the teaching role, the leadership role of the head of state is important
                    in desensitizing a sensitive topic, in sending a signal to the bureaucracy that
                    this is a program of high priority, in letting people know it is ok to practice
                    contraception, and particularly in empowering women to address this issue with
                    their husbands, who often are resistant to the notion of family planning and
                    fertility control. So the role of political leadership and a political
                    commitment is very important in much of the world and will remain a very
                    important feature in Africa. It is therefore very important for agencies like
                    USAID to continue to keep this issue on the agenda for policy dialogue and not
                    to reduce population merely to a technical program issue, because it is hardly
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I think that I have learned that human resources are the most important dimension
                    of social programs, including family planning, and that leadership training,
                    technical training, and technical assistance remain the heart of effective
                    programs.And, finally, I think today the most important need is for the
                    resources to see through what has been so successfully started. Between 1970 and
                    2000, contraceptive use in the developing world rose from around 1015% to close
                    to 60% of women of reproductive age. At the same time, actual fertility dropped
                    from around six to three children per woman on average in the developing world.
                    The desired fertility has declined even further to about two and half children,
                    and, in many countries, to two children. There are now twenty five countries in
                    the developing world which are at or below replacement fertility - slightly over
                    two children per woman, which is a fact that almost nobody would have predicted
                    in 1965. I think that very few people realize what an astoundingly effective
                    field of endeavor population has been, nor what enormously important leadership
                    USAID provided. For much of this history USAID represented in the neighborhood
                    of 50 per cent of all international resources that were available for population
                    and family planning, far in excess of any other bilateral or international
                    source of funding. And even today USAID probably represents on the order of 3540
                    per cent of all funding in this field, USAID has been an enormously important
                    player. USAID was also very controversial early on because of the strong focus
                    on the supplyside, but I think that that focus has stood the test of time and,
                    while, as I said in earlier parts of this oral history, USAID's supplyside
                    position was often overstated to the point of being a caricature. In the broad
                    scheme of things, if one had to err on one side or the other side, the supply
                    side was the right side to emphasize.</p>
                <p>A very interesting question that arises about the future has less to do with what
                    new discoveries we can make about how to reduce population growth. It has to do
                    with what happens at the other end of the demographic transition precisely
                    because we have been so successful - developing countries have been so
                    successful - in reducing fertility. Many developing countries have now gone
                    through the demographic transition at a much faster pace than any of today's
                    industrialized countries with the result that their age structures will change
                    much more rapidly than has happened in the West or in Japan. In other words, the
                    faster you go through the transition - the faster you go from high birth rates
                    to low births rates - the faster your population ages and the less time you have
                    to adjust from being an essentially young country to being essentially an old
                    country. Thailand went from being a very young country to being a middle aged
                    country in one generation, and it will be an old country in one more generation.
                    China has gone even faster than that, and one can name a number of other cases:
                    Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Indonesia, even Bangladesh. With their
                    extraordinarily rapid fertility declines, they are going to face strains at the
                    other end of the transition that make our's pale by comparison; such strains as
                    where to find the resources for old age security systems and pensions systems,
                    where to find the labor force as they suddenly go from a young age dependent to
                    an old age dependent population with very few people in the working ages in
                    between.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I think the really interesting population questions now have less to do with
                    persistent high fertility than with the pace of the transition and the
                    consequences of a rapid transition for social and economic progress. So I think
                    an area for international donors to begin making some intellectual investment is
                    in examining these questions in detail and trying to help developing countries
                    both anticipate and cope with the consequences of their own success in fertility
                    regulation, fertility control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What distinguishes the population field from other sectors
                        in U.S. foreign assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I would argue two things. The first is the scale of the resources
                    available. We simply, relative to the need, have committed far more resources
                    for population programs than we have had to any other sector of development over
                    the last quarter to half a century. When one agency - USAID - represents fifty
                    percent of the money in a field, it really sets it apart from any of the other
                    development sectors in which we have been involved. That made a big difference:
                    the willingness on the part of the American taxpayers to commit resources that
                    were sufficient to the task at hand.</p>
                <p>The second is, in the crucial years of the population program, it was centrally
                    administered. In other words, because the Office of Population had veto power
                    over field projects and an immense influence over the deployment of the
                    population officers, it had a very significant impact on the allocation of
                    resources not by political but by developmental need; it had a big impact on the
                    rationality with which resources were spent; and the ability to bring a truly
                    global perspective to the effort. It is the example that has led me to argue
                    that, in a postCold War world that we should organize the agency around
                    effectively directing resources toward the resolution of global issues rather
                    than sustaining particular levels of assistance to particular countries. The
                    latter becomes much less important with political alliances no longer as
                    compelling as they were during the Cold War. And the former becomes a much more
                    rational way to address global development problems than the way the agency
                    traditionally has allocated resources. So those are the two wayscale of
                    resources available, and the fact that one could take a global perspective on
                    their deploymenthat sets population apart from the other sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the contribution of foreign
                        assistance generally? Are there lessons that you would consider sort of
                        universals that apply to other sector not just population? How about your
                        work with public health, nutrition and your work in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SINDING: How to answer that without platitudes and cliches? I think that
                    development assistance can help in two crucial ways. First, if it is effectively
                    applied to the identification of constraints, it can help countries identify
                    priorities and help them allocate their own scarce resources in ways that can
                    break the bonds of tradition or low level equilibrium, as it once was called. It
                    can break through to higher levels of development; removing constraints through
                    careful analysis and good research and the strategic application of technical
                    assistance and research resources can make a big difference at the initial
                    stages of development.</p>
                <p>I also think that development assistance can help governments that are already
                    committed to doing the right thing to accelerate the process. What development
                    assistance cannot do is overcome bad policies. I think that one thing that we
                    have learned over the last fifty years is that where the policy environment is
                    bad, or where political commitment is lacking, or where corruption is rife,
                    development assistance is simply throwing good money after bad. Local
                    commitment, vision, wisdom, leadership are absolutely crucial. Where they exist
                    foreign assistance can help; where they are absent foreign assistance almost
                    never can help, except as a palliative. Sometimes foreign assistance can make
                    the lives of the poorest somewhat less miserable by substituting for what
                    governments themselves should be doing. But it can never, or almost never,
                    reverse a bad policy. I guess the best example of this that I can think omaybe
                    the best positive examplis Asia and the socalled “Tigers,” and the way in which
                    foreign assistance helped them to train the first generation of development
                    thinkers and leaders, who, subsequently, put in place policies and programs that
                    enabled those countries to break through to high levels of development. Foreign
                    assistance was really important in Taiwan and Korea and Thailand in preparing
                    the first generation and then in helping to finance their schemes and programs.
                    It didn't produce development; except perhaps in Korea, where the scale of
                    assistance was very high. For the most part this money is risk capital that
                    helps establish the conditions for economic takeoff and social development. On
                    the other side, I think of the vast amounts of money that were poured into
                    hopeless causes, I think of Moi's Kenya, Marcos' Philippines, the Shah's Iran,
                    Mobutu's Zaire where no amount of well intentioned money could overcome corrupt
                    regimes and bad policies. Those are, of course, the most extreme examples, but
                    there are many around the world where the failure of governments to provide
                    enlightened leadership made it impossible for foreign assistance to make a
                    difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Some other lessons. I think partnerships. I mentioned, in talking about the World
                    Bank, how important, in the social sectors, partnerships between the donor and
                    the host country are. Working together to identify constraints and overcome
                    constraints, making midcourse corrections as you see things that are not
                    working, and the strategic application of technical assistance and training to
                    overcome local constraints, these are the things that foreign assistance can do
                    when it is well applied. I think that a field presence is absolutely crucial,
                    and the U.S. is the only country and USAID is the only agency, at its best, that
                    has the kind of field presence that permits that sort of partnership to play
                    itself out. Some of the Europeans, in some countries, do it sometimes, but the
                    U.S. is the only donor that has consistently had on the ground the capacity to
                    perform in that partnership role in a way that really made a substantial and
                    lasting difference.</p>
                <p>Finally, I think that from my Foundation experience I have come to have a much
                    deeper appreciation of the catalytic role of external actors rather than their
                    fundamental assistance role. I think that, at its best, the development agency
                    goes out and finds the best institutions and resources available and creatively
                    engages them in the development process. That USAID ought to increasingly serve
                    as a catalytic force rather than delivering packages of assistance. It should
                    help in forging partnerships, public/private, interinstitutional academic and
                    otherwise, to bring the best resources to bear on a development problem. Aid for
                    too long has been seen as resource transfer where the resource in primarily
                    money. I think, at its best, it is intellectual transfer and the forging of long
                    term partnerships and alliances that to go to the heart of the development
                    enterprise, which is the building of institutions and human capacities.
                    Sustainable development can only occur where there are local institutions and
                    people who have the capacity to plan and carry out development. And the role of
                    foreign assistance serves that best where it enables that to happen rather than
                    financing large scale programs which are not sustainable, in many instances, and
                    where the money would have been better spent on building the local capacities to
                    generate wealth and resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would sum up your personal experience and career with
                        U. S. foreign assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SINDING: I would begin by saying my happiest years professionally were the years
                    that I spent at USAID as Director of the Office of Population, as a field
                    officer in Kenya and the Philippines and Pakistan. Having the privilege to live
                    and work overseas, it was and has been a marvelous career. To be privileged
                    enough to live in other countries, to be exposed to the enormous opportunity for
                    learning and the richness of cultural experiences that overseas living provides,
                    to be able to raise a family in those exciting and educational environments is a
                    rare privilege. I often found myself waking up in the morning saying I can't
                    believe that people are paying me to do this.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Also, it is hard to think of other careers in which you really change jobs every
                    three or four or five years but within the security of a single agency. Because
                    every time you change countries or change sectors or positions within USAID, it
                    is really is like starting a new job and yet you have tenure and job security
                    and a pension and all of the things, that by the time you reach almost sixty as
                    I am now, loom as pretty important. I wouldn't trade a single year of the twenty
                    years that I had with USAID; it was really only the realization that we had
                    reached the end of the road professionally in terms of overseas work that led my
                    wife and me to finish at the age fifty; also the fact that our children were now
                    starting college, and we wanted to continue to be close to them; they were going
                    to be in the States.</p>
                <p>So we left after twenty years but in many ways I wished it could have been
                    longer, because, as I look back on it, they were the happiest professional years
                    that I have had. I worry a lot about whether the current generation of USAID
                    people will be able to say the same thing, and I worry even more about whether
                    the next generation will be able to say it, because I think, in many ways, USAID
                    is no longer nearly as good a place to work as it was when I was there. First of
                    all the resources become less and less as time goes on; you practically never
                    have enough money to do anything really meaningful; second, missions have become
                    so small that this great comparative advantage of the United States is being
                    lost, of being able to forge real partnerships on the ground. Finally, I think
                    that the bureaucratic tangle of rules and regulations has become so onerous that
                    much of the fun and intellectual excitement of foreign assistance has been
                    overwhelmed by the bureaucratic paperwork, managing for results, accountability,
                    managing contracts, the procurement procesall of that has taken a great deal of
                    fun out of the business and I think that unless there are really serious
                    thoroughgoing reforms of USAID and a renewed political commitment to
                    international development assistance that the whole thing is in danger of just
                    drying up. I hope I am wrong, or alternatively, I hope that the things that need
                    to happen will happen. But I feel very privileged to have been a part oUSAID
                    when I think it made a big difference in a lot of countries, for all of its
                    imperfections and for all of the difficulty trying to do development in the

                        oral history. It is an excellent recording of one of the major dimensions of

                        contribution.</hi>
