                <p>HANS N. TUCH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Benis Frank </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 19, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>TUCH: I came to the United States from Germany, from Berlin, in 1938, as a
                    14-year-old school boy, and I lived with relatives in Kansas City, where I went
                    to high school and then started in college. That was interrupted by World War
                    II, and I served as a U.S. Army paratrooper from 1943 to '45 in Europe, in the
                    invasion of Europe, jumped, and then also spent time in Bastogne during the
                    Battle of the Bulge.</p>
                <p>I accumulated enough active combat points to be able to be discharged very early,
                    and so I got back to Kansas City and back to the university by December '45,
                    finished in '47, and then went on to graduate school at Johns Hopkins School of
                    Advanced International Studies, got an M.A. there, and went to work for the
                    Chase Bank. They trained me and then sent me to Germany, but after a short time,
                    the bank and I parted company. I left. They wouldn't let me get married. In
                    those days, Chase Bank was a very paternalistic organization.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I got into the Foreign Service because the State Department was
                    taking over from military government in Germany just at that time, October 1949,
                    and they were looking for people. They were hiring them on the spot without any
                    clearance, and so I was hired as a director of an America House of the U.S.
                    Cultural Center started in Wiesbaden. I brought my fianc� over, we got married
                    in Wiesbaden, and then I was shortly thereafter transferred to Frankfurt, where
                    I was the America House Director and Cultural Affairs Officer until 1955. In
                    '55, we came back to Washington on assignment. This was my first Washington
                    assignment. By that time, my career plans had been sort of regularized. I became
                    a Foreign Service officer, no longer a temporary. I served for two years
                    building Atoms for Peace exhibits all over the world, subsequent to President
                    Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace speech before the United Nations General Assembly
                    in '54. I built exhibits on Atoms for Peace. Then I was requested and was given
                    intensive Russian language training for one year in Washington, and then finally
                    in July 1958, I was transferred.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Well, in '57, before being transferred to Moscow, there were visa problems. The
                    Soviets would not permit a second officer to be assigned to Moscow for cultural
                    and press affairs, and so I was given a job as a Voice of America correspondent
                    and editorial writer in Munich. I spent a year in Munich for the Voice of
                    America before being transferred to Moscow in the summer of 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about Russian training. Let me just go back.
                        You came from where in Germany originally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father was a professional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: My father and my mother both originally came from the—at that time, German
                    province of Posen, city of Posen, and moved to Berlin right after World War I.
                    My father was a professional person who died very young of natural causes when I
                    was 11 years old. Then my mother stayed there, and she then later joined me in
                    Kansas City, where I was by that time living. It took her longer to get out of
                    Germany than it did me primarily because of visas and affidavits to come to the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>But my interest in Russia and the Soviet Union came, really, with college. I took
                    some Russian courses, and I really minored in Russian history in undergraduate
                    work. Then in graduate work, I continued working with Russian a little bit, but
                    you didn't take language courses in graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I asked you was you said the State Department
                        sent you for intensive Russian. Of course, the State Department has good
                        language programs, but I notice on your curriculum vitae, of course, you are
                        a native German speaker, and the Russian you picked up. I assume Portuguese,
                        Bulgarian, and French you picked up along the way. Or was it because most
                        Europeans are multi-lingual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. The only thing I had when I came to the United States, I didn't have
                    any English, but I did have some French. I didn't have really very much English,
                    but when you live in the Middle West as a school boy, you learn it very quickly.
                    You conform. That's one of the things, I didn't have anybody in my family to
                    speak a word of German except an uncle, and so I learned English that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sink or swim.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. That was the technique that my family used by sending me right to an
                    American high school after two weeks, and therefore you did learn it rather
                    quickly. But Russian and Bulgarian and Portuguese I learned as part of my
                    Foreign Service assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you gained a degree of fluency in these.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Russian—I mean, other than German—is still my best foreign language.
                    Interestingly enough, I'm a terrible, terrible translator or interpreter between
                    German and English. Very bad. I can speak both of them, but I cannot cross over.
                    In Russian, I'm much better than I am in German when it comes to translating and
                    interpreting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've gotten to the point you were assigned to the embassy
                        in Moscow. At some point here—and this is a parenthetical thought—in dealing
                        with USIA, you initially were appointed to the State Department as a foreign
                        FSO temporary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There should be clarification in these interviews as to
                        the parallel careers of USIA and how it fits within the fabric of the
                        Foreign Service program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right. Now, I was initially appointed to the State Department, that being
                    the only organization that existed in 1949-50. USIA was created in '53, the
                    summer of '53, and I transferred from the State Department to USIA, because the
                    work that I was doing and the work I was interested in doing was the type of
                    work that was done by USIA, mainly public diplomacy, I call it, which means
                    trying to communicate with foreign publics, whether in the area of information
                    activities—press or media activities—or whether in the more long-term
                    relationships such as cultural exchanges, books, libraries, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been, within the Foreign Service program, an FSO
                        who was assigned to this type of thing, or was it a post-war evolution where
                        there was an emphasis on cultural exchanges and media exchanges and so on?
                        It seems to me, from what I know of the Foreign Service, it's just like the
                        attitude of the military regarding the media and culture, etc.; there was no
                        MOS.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TUCH: That's right. It started before World War II, namely, with the Coordinator
                    for Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, vis-a-vis mostly Latin America,
                    but it really came into its own after World War II. There are a couple of
                    documents, a couple of sort of brief histories of how this all came about. But
                    it got a tremendous impetus both from our occupation of Japan and our occupation
                    of Germany, where a lot of emphasis was put on the whole area of—they called it
                    reorientation and reeducation. That may have failed, the reorientation or
                    reeducation, or it may not have been as successful as the resources we put into
                    that program would have dictated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Japan was better than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: One can take more credit or less credit. But at any rate, the whole idea of
                    communicating in the media field and concern with the media and also concern
                    with long-range cultural and educational exchanges got a tremendous impetus
                    through these two occupation programs, and a lot of young Foreign Service
                    officers got their training in Japan or in Germany through these programs. Then
                    when the whole area of public diplomacy became regularized with the creation of
                    USIA, many of these young people were trained and continued in this type of
                    activity. It very slowly gained a certain amount of respectability in the
                    Foreign Service. Whether it has achieved its full purpose, I don't think so by
                    now, but at least a whole agency was created to do this kind of work, so it
                    gained an amount of visibility and respectability in the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>As far as the Foreign Service officers doing this kind of work, for many, many
                    years, it was sort of not regarded in the same area as political and economic
                    reporting. In the military, it was also the infantry, the artillery were the
                    most . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The queens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: The queens. Therefore, the intelligence service and the public affairs
                    activities were put sort of on the sidelines. Well, this is also largely true
                    with public affairs activities over the years. It's improved tremendously. It's
                    come into its own in many, many respects, but I would not say 100%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A USIA officer is still a second-class citizen as far as
                        the Foreign Service is concerned. That's my perception.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TUCH: I think primarily my perception—yes and no. If you take it into
                    consideration as far as picking people for ambassadorial positions, then I think
                    I would agree with you. But when it comes to exerting influence within an
                    embassy or within an operation in a country, I would disagree, because in many,
                    many areas, in many countries, the public affairs officer probably is the most
                    useful and the most important and, in some cases, the best trained person that
                    an ambassador has on his staff. If the ambassador is good and smart, he makes
                    use of these talents and does so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if he's a political appointee, he doesn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: That, too, varies. Now, for instance, in my case, I may be an aberration. I
                    worked for my last post, which probably was my most satisfactory experience in
                    the Foreign Service for the last four and a half years, were with Arthur Burns,
                    a political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made that point in your letter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes, yes. So it's not always that case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was making a flat-out statement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Right. Right. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you'll also notice we've gone far afield from Moscow,
                        which is a technique which you may have to use, because, again, we're on
                        tape here, but it's a tutorial. I feel that if you're dealing in an area
                        which calls for going off on a tangent and profitably so, I think it's
                        important to do so, especially if a point comes up in the course of an
                        interview that the light comes on and you feel that the interviewee has
                        something to contribute in that area, then instead of making a note and
                        coming back to it, I think it's profitable to hit it at that time. It may
                        not flow well, it may not track right, but you're thinking and you're in a
                        good rapport with the interviewer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: What one might just mention—and therefore close off this particular part of
                    the interview—is the fact that this is a whole entire subject which has
                    interested me very, very much, this whole area of public diplomacy as part of
                    our foreign policy process. As a matter of fact, I teach two courses right now,
                    one at Georgetown University, which deals with the public diplomacy or the
                    intercultural communications process. The other course that I teach is,
                    actually, to junior officer trainees at USIA in the field of public
                    diplomacy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we got off on a tangent, you mentioned how there
                        were problems in getting the Soviet Government to accept you as a second
                        officer, and you went to Voice of America in Munich.</hi>

                <p>TUCH: Right. Then the Soviets, frankly, just wouldn't give me a visa because I
                    was a USIA officer, so the resolution of that particular problem was that I
                    resigned from USIA, I applied and was appointed by the Department of State, and
                    I was made a State Department officer, and I got my visa to the Soviet Union. I
                    arrived there in July.</p>
                <p>Now, I might just, by way of introduction, why I think this particular period, to
                    me, at least, was a fascinating period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask you one question beforehand. Were you USIA
                        people not given diplomatic immunity at this time, or was it just Russia
                        that refused to recognize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: The Soviet Union just would not give a USIA officer—I mean a propaganda
                    officer—a visa to join the embassy staff, so I resigned. I was appointed by the
                    Department and was assigned as the press and cultural attach� as a second
                    secretary of the embassy, and I was the last one. The people who came after me
                    fared much better and stayed within USIA.</p>
                <p>The reason that my period, my three years in the Soviet Union, were a
                    particularly interesting period for me is two-fold, two unrelated reasons. One,
                    it was a really roller coaster period of our relationship with the Soviet Union.
                    It started out, when I got there, with the spirit of Camp David, and the
                    following year, we had our first big American national exhibition with the Nixon
                    visit to the Soviet Union, and the relationship under Khrushchev on the Soviet
                    side, Eisenhower on the American side, seemed to take really a very, very steep
                    upward turn.</p>
                <p>Then came, in 1960—May 1, 1960—the U-2 affair with Gary Powers, and our
                    relationship took, really, a nose-dive, way, way down back into, really, almost
                    a Cold War period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that they didn't know about the U-2 flights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I think they knew about it, but they hadn't been able to do anything about
                    it until that particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So was it a manufactured nose-dive or a nose-dive that
                        came out of, “Now we've caught you”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: It was a double one, because our first initial reaction, if you remember
                    correctly, we would not admit it.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: We wouldn't admit it. Actually, my one [laughter] accidental accomplishment
                    in that whole period was an interesting little anecdote. We did not know—the
                    Americans did not know—where the U-2 had been shot down. We knew it had been
                    shot down somewhere in the Soviet Union, and we could not find out from the
                    Soviets where, actually, they had shot down. That became a very important issue
                    for us, because here was Eisenhower still claiming publicly that obviously they
                    had shot down near the border or it was an accident, that it strayed across, and
                    it hadn't strayed across. We were sort of aggressive in our reaction. This was
                    May 1st when it was announced, and all though that whole day, it was just back
                    and forth between Washington and Moscow—”Where was this plane? Where was it shot
                    down?” We were saying it was not shot down inside the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>That evening, there was a press reception that the Union of Journalists were
                    sponsoring for May 1st, and because of our improving relationship up to that
                    time, I had been invited to that reception for the first time ever. Of course, I
                    got to the reception, I was surrounded by very, very angry Soviet journalists,
                    and all kinds of, “How can you do this? You are ruining the relationship and
                    spying,” etc., etc.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you know, it's an unfriendly act to shoot down the plane of a
                    nation that you are supposedly having a good relationship with, so it's an
                    unfriendly act that you committed shooting down the plane.”</p>
                <p>One of the journalists said, “Gospadin Tuch, what can you do? What could we have
                    done? The plane was over Sverdlovsk. We had to shoot it down.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Where?” And he kind of backed away from me, and they all sort of
                    dispersed.</p>
                <p>I went back to the embassy. It was about 11:00 o'clock by that time, and I
                    thought, “This is an item of information that I think I'm going to wake up
                    Llewellyn Thompson,” our ambassador, Tommy Thompson. I went to the residence. I
                    did not want to take a chance of using the telephone. I went to the residence,
                    and I didn't wake him up, but he was in his robe. I told him what I'd heard, and
                    in his very quiet sort of laid-back way, which was, of course, Ambassador
                    Thompson's technique, at least as long as I knew him, very quiet, soft-spoken,
                    he looked me and said, “I think you'd better go back to the embassy and report
                    this to Washington.” And on what they called a NIACT cable in those days, which
                    was an immediate telegram, “And be sure to wake up the communicator to send that
                    message, because I think this is one item of information they'd like to get.”
                    So, you know, that's what I did.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, I was talking about the roller coaster.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you a couple of questions before we go to
                        the roller coaster. Number one, I would assume that maybe outside of the
                        ambassador and the military attach�s, maybe, that no one at the embassy knew
                        about the U-2 program, which had to be at that time very, very closely
                        held.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't know about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I certainly did not know about it. I doubt that—maybe the ambassador knew
                    about it. I would think that he probably did, and I would think that probably
                    our Central Intelligence Agency representatives knew about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good gracious! CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. But I certainly don't think that probably our attach�s knew about it
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a CIA program, anyway. It wasn't a military
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Number two, you mentioned Tommy Thompson, Llewellyn
                        Thompson, professional, one of the real experts on Soviet Russia going way
                        back to, I guess, the blitz days, when Thayer and some of the other ones
                        were there. You might want to personalize and characterize him. What did he
                        look like? I think he was red-haired, if I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. [Laughter] Sandy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sandy. Right. But I think I've heard him described as
                        sandy-haired.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TUCH: He, of course, is one of my four, so to speak, godfathers—ideals—as far as
                    people that I've worked for. Just to mention the other three, being Edward R.
                    Murrow, John Crimmins, and Arthur Burns. But he was really my first boss, with
                    whom, as a relatively junior officer, when I was 34 years old when I got to
                    Moscow, and I was a relatively junior officer. But you had in Moscow at that
                    time, it was an ideal, from my point of view, an ideal American embassy. You had
                    no hierarchy, you had no protocol. It was a small embassy. I counted—we had 14
                    substantive officers in the embassy, other than the military. There were 14
                    substantive officers, there were 16 military officers, and there were about ten
                    administrative types in the embassy, and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Leo Du Lac there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes, he was there. He was the assistant naval attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've spoken about Leo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: He was a great Marine officer, just a great Marine officer, and he did a
                    marvelous job there. We were very good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also that's the time before the agricultural attach�s
                        and all the other agencies in government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I count the agricultural attach� as part of the 14 substantive officers.
                    But we had, for instance, an ambassador, we had a deputy chief of mission,
                    minister of the embassy. We had no counselors. We had one first secretary,
                    politico-economic, sort of almost like the British system, a chancery head. He
                    was a chancery head. And the rest of us were second secretaries. We were all
                    working stiffs—the political section, the economic section, agricultural
                    section, and the publications procurement officer, one officer who bought books
                    for the whole U.S. Government, who just did nothing but go around Moscow buying
                    books at bookstores. I helped him, because he helped me. His name was Harry
                    Barnes, who's now ambassador to Chile. He and I did share the cultural and press
                    relations work. It was too much to do for one person, so he helped me, and I
                    helped him buy books. But at any rate, it was a very tight, very small, very
                    collegial type of embassy in those days. Everybody knew everybody, and everybody
                    worked for the ambassador and the deputy chief of mission, who was sort of the
                    executive officer, by the name of “Dick” Richard Davis. Not Davies, but
                    Davis.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It was, from my point of view, an ideal situation working for an ambassador who
                    recognized—and here we come back to the public diplomacy angle—who recognized
                    that in a situation in which we functioned, the cultural and press relations
                    work was the most substantive activity that an embassy could do. Obviously, we
                    read the papers and reported on political areas, economic developments,
                    agriculture developments, but he saw that the only people who really got out to
                    talk to people were the people who did public affairs work. There was, at that
                    time, only one—myself.</p>
                <p>He was terribly supportive about the cultural affairs work. For instance, say you
                    had a delegation of American composers there, and you wanted to have a party.
                    Well, you knew that the Soviet officials would not come to your apartment to be
                    with these American composers. But they may come to the residence. The
                    ambassador's house was open to any kind of a party or reception or get-together,
                    where we all felt that the Soviet officials and maybe even some composers and
                    musicians might come to the Spaso house, the ambassador's official residence,
                    but they wouldn't come to my place. He was very, very supportive of this, and
                    he, having been in the Soviet Union during World War II, in the 1940s, knew a
                    lot of the—at that time, younger, creative people, ballet dancers, opera singers
                    from the early Forties, who now were fairly old and many of them retired, but he
                    knew them, and they would come sometimes to his place. Therefore, he provided
                    the opening that was so important for us.</p>
                <p>Why it was interesting for me to be in the Soviet Union during that period of
                    time. The relationship, from its nadir, took an upward turn with the election of
                    President Kennedy, and the release of the RB-47 pilots, who had been another
                    sort of semi-spy plane, who had been shot down in Murmansk, in the ocean, had
                    been shot down, something that was really not much talked about. But that's
                    another story, because there's an interesting anecdote, too, about the release
                    of these two pilots.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I think Khrushchev wanted to make a gesture vis-a-vis Kennedy, and by
                    releasing these guys, it had been a sore point in our relationship, and the
                    relationship took an up-turn until the Bay of Pigs invasion. Then even worse, it
                    took the real down-turn again after the meeting between Khrushchev and Kennedy
                    in July 1961 in Vienna, where Kennedy got his real first taste of what it was
                    like to negotiate or to relate or to be up against the Soviet Union in the form
                    of Nikita Khrushchev. As a matter of fact, there was one interesting anecdote. I
                    wasn't there. I was in Moscow still. But when Tommy Thompson, who had gone to
                    Vienna to be with the President, came back, we asked him how things went, and he
                    said, “You know, after the first day of the meetings, of the relationship, the
                    President turned to me and says, 'Ambassador Thompson, now I understand why you
                    want to get out of the Soviet Union so badly.'” [Laughter] At any rate, it took
                    a down-turn again, and that is really when I left Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The other interesting point to mention about the whole assignment, my three years
                    in Moscow, I was the first American embassy officer to serve more than two years
                    after World War II. There was a hard and fast rule by the Department of State
                    that you could not serve longer than two years in Moscow, a rule that Tommy
                    Thompson had tried to break for a number of years, because he felt that some
                    people didn't become useful to the embassy until they'd been there for about two
                    years. [Laughter] And so he negotiated with George Allen, who was at that time
                    the Director of USIA, who was also, of course, a State Department officer,
                    career Foreign Service officer, on whether he could assign me for a third year.
                    He did that without asking me. Then when George Allen said yes, he called me in
                    and said, “I would like to keep you for a third year.” Well, I felt so flattered
                    by being asked anything by Tommy Thompson, that I immediately said yes, and only
                    then realized I should really talk this over with my wife first, because the
                    assignment in Moscow, professionally, probably one of the most interesting
                    assignments one could have, the roughness or the really bad part of the
                    assignment was more on the wife and the children than it was on the officer,
                    because the officer had the interesting political developments to contend with,
                    whereas the wife only had the hardships to contend with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which comes to a good point, because I was about to ask
                        you, since this is your interview, the personal side—where you lived, how
                        you existed, whether you lived on the local economy or had to bring in
                        foodstuffs from outside the country, the day-to-day living, schooling for
                        the children, whether or not your wife and children became fluent in
                        Russian, etc. If you'd speak about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I might ask you, since you're all part of this tutorial, if there's some aspect

                    forgetting about it, he should bring in, please jump in, although he's doing
                    quite well.</p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, life was pretty tough in Moscow in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no compound as there is today?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>TUCH: Well, before I got there, everybody who was assigned to the embassy had
                    lived in the embassy building, which was located on the Tchaikovsky Ring, and
                    was a 12-story building where our offices and apartments were located. But
                    before I came to the embassy, about two years before I came to the embassy,
                    there was some expansion, and people were assigned apartments by the Soviet
                    Government in other areas. Where we were assigned to was a huge compound with
                    about 800 apartments, which had been built as a diplomatic compound for
                    diplomatic families of all nations, East and West. At that time, for instance, a
                    large wing was occupied by the Chinese, still, because the relationship was
                    still fairly decent at that time. We lived in an apartment in there, which, by
                    Soviet standards, was, I guess, fairly good. We had three bedrooms, and it was
                    spacious, but by American standards—well, the anecdote that I'd like to relate,
                    we arrived on an evening, we were taken up to our apartment, and we walked in.
                    The first thing I looked for was the front door, because I thought I'd been
                    taken up through the back door, you know, where there was a freight elevator and
                    so forth. [Laughter] Of course, we had been taken through the front door, which
                    looked like that kind of an apartment. It was fairly primitive by American
                    standards, but it had been supplied by us, by the embassy, with an American
                    refrigerator, American stove. We had brought washing machine and dryer with us,
                    which were put out into the hallway, because there was no other place to put
                    it.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, we knew it was going to be a hardship post, and the wonderful
                    thing about this assignment in Moscow was because it was a hardship post,
                    because everybody lived sort of under the same condition and was up against it,
                    all but the administrative officer, who had a wonderful place in the chancery,
                    we all held together, and the enemy was the administrative officer as much as
                    the Soviets in this respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was FSO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No, he wasn't FSO. He rose very high and very rapidly in the Foreign
                    Service and at one time became the Under Secretary of State for Administrative
                    Affairs. You do know him—Idar Rimestad.</p>
                <p>(Unidentified speaker): He was my ambassador in Geneva.</p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes, that's where he made his claim to fame. So he kind of focused the
                    animosity that was not directly to the Soviets on himself, deservedly so. But at
                    any rate, we lived in this apartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have heroes and villains in these interviews.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>TUCH: We lived in this apartment for nine months, and then a very strange thing
                    happened. Suddenly, one noticed that the building was deteriorating much more
                    rapidly than most new buildings in Moscow deteriorated. We were used to the fact
                    that over the first floor of most apartment buildings, new apartment buildings
                    in Moscow, there was a net so that falling bricks from the building would hit
                    the net and not the pedestrian walking down the street. But that was sort of
                    standard throughout Moscow. In the newest sections, you had nets over the
                    sidewalks for falling bricks. Well, we had that, too, and nobody paid very much
                    attention to that because it was standard. Then they built a canopy, a wooden
                    canopy, over the entrance so that you wouldn't be hit by falling things as you
                    entered the building. Suddenly, many of us noticed cracks in our walls—real
                    cracks—in even the supporting walls. We reported this and were told, among
                    others, by Idar Rimestad, “Don't worry, these are not supporting walls. This is
                    just the building settling.” It was built about a year before that time. So one
                    worried, but one didn't worry too much, because the apartment was fairly
                    decent.</p>
                <p>One morning, in our apartment, we were sitting at breakfast, and there was a
                    tremendous crash. We rushed into the living room, and the window plus the frame
                    had simply broken out and crashed outward. In other words, the building had
                    shifted, so that the frame and the windows just disappeared. This was duly
                    reported. Suddenly, the Soviets became apparently very concerned, because one of
                    the gas mains had cracked, too, in the basement, and they were immediately
                    afraid of gas explosions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period of year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: This was in the spring of '59, March of '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still cold.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>TUCH: We were ordered—remember there were 800 apartments, roughly, 120 per block,
                    and there were about six blocks, 800 apartments—we were ordered, every
                    diplomatic mission was ordered to move out within three days, but no place was
                    given to us where to move to. There were negotiations with the Soviets. Finally,
                    the Soviets came up with a new block of apartments which had been built for the
                    Soviets, but the Soviets hadn't moved in yet. Some had moved in and were kicked
                    out, and these were new apartments, and we were supposed to move into them
                    within three days. Here Mr. Rimestad came into the fray again. These were
                    supposed to be temporary apartments, and he didn't want to move our
                    refrigerators, our stoves, our sinks, into them, because, after all, that was
                    going to cause a lot of commotion. There was a stove and a sink in the
                    apartment, the Soviet one, and he wasn't going to do this for us. After all,
                    when you come to Moscow, “You don't plan,”—these were his exact quotes—”to live
                    in a white frame house with a picket fence around the garden.” This
                    notwithstanding that he had an apartment in the chancery which was right next to
                    the DCM's, to the minister's apartment, and it was, you know, one of the really
                    nice apartments.</p>
                <p>At any rate, that's when these 30 or 40 embassy families, who were the core of
                    our—you know, we were all very close and friends, we revolted. We asked for a
                    meeting with the ambassador, and we said, “We're going to send our families out
                    because the hygienic conditions are such that unless we have refrigerators and
                    unless we have our own stoves, we just can't afford to leave our families here,
                    and we're going to send our families to Vienna or Berlin or to Germany to live,
                    because we just could not do this.”</p>
                <p>Well, the ambassador looked into it and ordered Idar Rimestad to move our
                    refrigerators and stoves to these temporary apartments. I emphasize the word
                    “temporary,” because this was April '59. These apartments are now still in use
                    by our embassy families. They were that temporary.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>At any rate, one other aspect of this was peculiar. When these were advertised by
                    our administrative officer as brand-new Soviet apartments, the best new
                    construction available, and we took this with a grain of salt. There was one
                    Soviet newspaper in those days, which was the Moscow evening newspaper, the
                    MDUL/Chernya Moskva.MDNM/, which was not always only devoted to official
                    decrees. They had a little bit of news items from time to time in that paper. It
                    so happened, just in those days when we were to move, there was a major expose
                    in that newspaper which one of my colleagues discovered and read out loud in
                    translation, because Idar Rimestad didn't speak any Russian, so at the staff
                    meeting, he translated for those who didn't speak Russian. It appears that a new
                    housing complex had been built and had been built so badly that the citizens who
                    lived in that housing complex started complaining to their local Communist Party
                    headquarters about the bad conditions. For instance, when one stepped out of the
                    balcony, the balcony crumpled and collapsed, so it couldn't even hold one person
                    out on the balcony, the concrete was so bad. People had to hold onto the railing
                    in order not to be catapulted to the ground. As a result of these complaints,
                    the local engineer had turned off the hot water and told the occupants of this
                    housing block that they could not get their hot water back until they stopped
                    complaining to Communist Party headquarters. So they had been without hot water,
                    plus their bad living conditions, for about two weeks. Then in the last final
                    paragraph, the address was given of this housing block, and it was the housing
                    block where we were moving in, the Ninski Prospect number four. [Laughter] That
                    was our housing block.</p>
                <p>At any rate, we moved into this place and it was fairly much of a shambles for at
                    least the next year or two. The apartment size depended on the number of people
                    we had, so we were given two apartments on the same floor, one two-room
                    apartment and one three-room apartment, separated by the hallway. We had two
                    children with us. One was a first-grader and the other one was kindergarten. We
                    also had brought with us, because this was really the only way to handle it, we
                    had brought with us a German au pair, who was to kind of help us with the
                    children, because the Soviet situation with help was very unreliable, because
                    when the Soviets would get mad or wanted to do you a dirty trick, they would
                    just withdraw the maid and say, “Well, nobody wants to work for you American
                    spies and you American warmongers,” and you couldn't get any help. In the
                    meantime, your wife, at that time, also was really very much preoccupied and
                    occupied with, really, making the family be able to live. She stood in line in
                    the stores during the day to shop, because there was no Soviet diplomatic
                    grocery store. There was not even a dollar store where you could buy things for
                    dollars, as now exists throughout the Soviet Union. We were completely dependent
                    upon our own resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>One of the things we were authorized to do before we came to the Soviet Union, we
                    were allowed to bring with us 4,000 pounds of food or household products. In
                    those days, it was really a very interesting phenomenon, because all of us,
                    obviously, we went and purchased 4,000 pounds of whatever we thought was most
                    important for us to keep around. We, for instance, brought 250 pounds of coffee
                    with us, because we figured that would last us for two years. We were very
                    adamant we wanted our coffee. My wife was very adamant that she was going to
                    bring soap products and cleaning products with us, so in her case, the 4,000
                    pounds, a large amount was coffee and cleaning products. The hell with the rest
                    of it. But the fact is that when you compared notes among your embassy
                    colleagues, everybody brought 4,000 pounds of something. In those days, whatever
                    you brought 4,000 pounds worth cost 1,000 bucks. This was sort of standard that
                    it was roughly $1,000 to $1,200 that you spent on those 4,000 pounds of food or
                    household products. Anyway, we brought these 4,000 pounds of products, but you
                    had absolutely no place to put them, because you had no storage space. So what
                    you did is you built shelves in your hallway and in your bedrooms, and you had
                    your products on those shelves, wooden shelves. As you walked into the
                    apartment, you had these shelves on which all your products were located. Then,
                    of course, you didn't have a balcony or any place, unless your dryer was
                    working, which it very often wasn't, so you had to hang all your laundry in your
                    apartment also. So you know, your apartment was both a place to live, but also
                    for your utilities, your laundry to hang on.</p>
                <p>I remember very vividly one occasion when Congressman Wayne Hayes, who was a
                    great critic of the Department and the Foreign Service and really our whole
                    foreign relations establishment and always considered everybody in the Foreign
                    Service as striped pants and cookie-pushers, when he made a visit, came to visit
                    the Soviet Union to see how gloriously we lived in the socialist capital, and so
                    we all got together, and we invited him to have lunch in one of our apartments.
                    It was my neighbor's apartment. We saw to it that this apartment was, you know,
                    really in its most normal, typical fashion at that particular time. For
                    instance, when he came in, there were wet bed sheets hanging in the front
                    closet, and they had to be lifted up so that he could go underneath in order to
                    get into the living room. Somebody, of course, dropped it just as he was coming
                    under, so he got a little wet. Anyway, we had him for lunch, and we served him
                    the food that our wives really were able to purchase on the local economy after
                    standing in line, and those things that we were able to have brought with us in
                    our initial shipment, which was canned corn beef and canned chicken. Those were
                    the foods. Not Spam—I mean, we were past the period of Spam, but you were still
                    with canned corned beef kind of thing, which the British loved and we hated. But
                    at any rate, we served them that, and then whatever was available that we'd
                    imported to our little commissary which we had in the embassy, where we'd
                    brought in things from Helsinki and sometimes from Copenhagen and sometimes from
                    Berlin—always under escort, incidentally. Anything that had to be brought in had
                    to be brought in by diplomatic courier with an escort.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>At any rate, we had him for lunch. Then, of course, after lunch, he excused
                    himself to go to the bathroom. Well, one of the things we didn't tell him, that
                    all toilets in the Soviet Union, when you flush them, the water spit out. So,
                    obviously, you had learned very early in the game that before you flushed the
                    toilet, you stepped to the side and then flushed it so you would not get hit by
                    the spray of water. Well, we obviously did not tell him to go to the bathroom,
                    and sure enough, when he came out, he was sort of crossing his legs and walking
                    very carefully and this kind of thing. [Laughter] Just to make the point that we
                    were living on the economy, which practically—not completely, because, as I
                    said, we did import things from Berlin, mostly staples, some fresh meats,
                    turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and some cheeses and some dairy
                    products. We had the reputation that we import everything. The Scandinavian
                    embassies could never understand that we would even buy the butter of the local
                    economy and eggs, because they imported everything from their Scandinavian home
                    countries—milk, eggs, butter, dairy products. We did it to some extent, but
                    really very little. Never eggs and butter, because you just depended upon what
                    you could find locally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this because of your administrative officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No. We were just not that organized, and we considered it a hardship post,
                    and to go to Moscow was part of the hardship, just like when people went to
                    Africa. They didn't get air-conditioning units for every room; if they had one,
                    they were lucky. So this was just part of your assignment to Moscow, that you
                    really had to live the way the Soviets lived. You didn't have to, but couldn't
                    live otherwise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TUCH: There is an anecdote there, too. One day, we had imported via Air France.
                    We had sort of a contract with Air France at Christmas time and Thanksgiving
                    time to bring in turkeys and a large food shipment by air. Air France was one of
                    the few airlines that was flying at that time into Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume there were food purveyors back in the country who
                        catered?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>TUCH: Ostermann Peterson was the most famous, and Peter Justesen were the two
                    Danish firms that really were specializing in providing foodstuffs and products
                    to diplomatic missions throughout the world, not just Eastern Europe, throughout
                    the world. We lived off of Peter Justesen and Ostermann Peterson. But Air France
                    had sent in this large shipment for which we paid, but they, in order to be
                    gracious, suddenly I came down to the commissary in the morning, and there was a
                    huge Gruyere cheese on the counter with a little mark on it, with a little flag
                    on it, “Help yourself.” And Idar Rimestad standing there saying, “Help yourself
                    to this cheese.” This had been donated by Air France to our embassy as sort of a
                    dividend, this one big cheese. So you cut off a slice for yourself. I said,
                    “Idar, how come you didn't take this one completely for yourself?” Which he
                    could have; nobody would have been the wiser.</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no, no, no. This one is for you all. I already have two.”
                    [Laughter] So Idar was completely honest in his crookedness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he ever serve in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Oh, sure. Idar Rimestad was the personnel officer of HICOG when you and
                    Schechter and I served in HICOG. I, to this day, have two letters in my
                    personnel file RIFing me—firing me—from . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he before Glen Wolf came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No, he was working for Glen Wolf. Glen Wolf was administrator,
                    reddish-haired, and he was the chief personnel officer at that time. He had a
                    reputation to uphold by this time. He was one of the very few people, I must
                    admit, who hoodwinked Llewellyn Thompson completely. You know, he did
                    everything. Thompson was not demanding, but he saw to it—I mean, there were
                    always things done. Tommy Thompson's wishes were anticipated by Idar Rimestad,
                    and therefore, he was highly regarded by the ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about children, schooling and medical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: There was an Anglo-American school in Moscow which exists to this day,
                    which was a small school run jointly by the British and American Embassy and
                    open to all other embassies, priority to the American and British embassies, but
                    it had other children from other embassies, too, those that wanted to have their
                    children have an English-speaking education. We had about two or three teachers,
                    one British, one American, hired and brought in, and then a number of mothers
                    who had either training or desire to be helpful, did the kindergarten bit and
                    the teacher's aide kind of thing. That worked reasonably well for the time we
                    were there. During my first year in Moscow, there was no opportunity—the Soviets
                    would not permit the American Embassy children to attend a Soviet school. During
                    our second and third year, they did open up their schools to small children
                    whose parents wanted to send them to Soviet schools. Some parents did, with
                    mixed success, some with a good deal of success, and the kids really did learn
                    Russian and were able to succeed. Others, it was not a very successful
                    experience. In some cases, it was also a negative political experience. The
                    children, you know, came home telling their parents what their teachers told
                    them about America, and there was a lot of problems involved. But in some cases
                    it was successful.</p>
                <p>At any rate, we had a first-grader and a kindergartner, and then a second- and
                    third-grader, and then second, third, and fourth, and our Andrea, our daughter,
                    was nursery school, kindergarten, and first grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The wives who served to support the schooling, were they
                        paid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or were they volunteer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No, they were paid. They had to be qualified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will continue on with answering the question that was
                        asked you about the mothers who were the teachers' aides.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TUCH: I really can't remember. I can't be completely positive on whether they
                    were paid or not, but you know, it was sort of a situation, with the exception
                    of the professional teachers who were imported, that everybody pitched in and
                    did something. For instance, it wasn't asked of you. It was the sort of
                    situation where, for instance, you were expected to come to the ambassador's
                    receptions, and the ambassador, especially during our second and third year,
                    when the relationship developed so much, used to have three receptions per week
                    just to accommodate all the American visitors and congressional delegations and
                    things that came in, we divided the embassy up in platoons of a third each, so
                    that not everybody had to go to these and work at these receptions, but the
                    point is that the wives, obviously, tried to get to these receptions. On one
                    occasion I came, and we had two sick children. Our au pair, our German girl, was
                    also not well. My wife really just couldn't come, and I said something to Jane
                    Thompson, Mrs. Thompson, who was the ambassador's wife, “I'm very sorry my wife
                    didn't come to this reception,” although this was expected of her. She said,
                    “Don't tell me even why she couldn't come. She obviously is busy with something.
                    Remember, I'm a mother, too, here in Moscow, and I know what wives go through.
                    So forget it. Let her do her thing.” So it was the kind of a relationship that
                    you had there which, of course, I may have experienced in one other
                    post—Bulgaria and Sofia, but really nowhere else where the relationship was a
                    collegial, family type of an embassy. I mean, where the frustrations that
                    everybody had were really shared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting point. I've read in a number of places
                        the problems there were vis-a-vis wives, as a matter of fact, that the FSOs
                        were marked on fitness reports, how effective their wives were, how much
                        they threw themselves in and did things, for which they weren't paid and for
                        which they hadn't been hired. I think that happens with any institution or
                        corporation or the military. Of course, in some cases, with higher
                        officials, in the case of the military, the wives are used to wearing their
                        husband's rank or, in the case of an ambassador, it's “Mrs. Ambassador,” and
                        the wives are all their aides and so on. I'm sure it's a real problem which
                        exists in a highly concentrated institutional situation such as a diplomatic
                        or military post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: You worked in an entirely different social framework from the one that you
                    do now—an entirely different social framework. Of course, it had its negative
                    side. It did have ambassadors' wives who were ogres, you know, who were just
                    really vicious or very, very bad in their relationships as their husbands,
                    spouses, in a particular post situation. But on the other hand . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose in the case of those wives of professional
                        career FSOs, it had been done to them, and now it's their chance.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. Right. And there were some who had a reputation. I won't name them,
                    but everybody knows them now. I mean, most of them are dead by now, but they
                    existed, and you knew them and you knew before you got to the post that this was
                    going to be one of your problems. But on the other hand, you also had the
                    situation that when you joined the Foreign Service, I think you made the
                    commitment as a husband and wife, and it was more or less, as I said, a
                    different era of our social history, that your wife was expected to participate
                    and not be paid for it, but to participate in her husband's career as an
                    adjunct. Let's face it. Now, I don't think this is necessarily good, but this
                    was the situation, and it has changed completely since that time. The wives were
                    rated. But, for instance, in Moscow, where the situation was tough for the
                    wives, for the families, they participated and they were, on the other hand,
                    given the credit, and they were appreciated by, in this case, Ambassador
                    Thompson and Jane Thompson, who said, “We could not function here as an embassy
                    without the wives participating fully.” It was recognized and appreciated. Not
                    much was said about it or done about it, but I am sure that in every efficiency
                    report written in Moscow by the ambassador or by the DCM, the wives were given
                    full credit for their participation. They knew they were being rated, and they
                    were given full credit for it. It was a team effort. They were being harassed by
                    the Soviets as the officers were, too.</p>
                <p>I remember on my first long trip outside of Moscow, I went on a ten-day trip down
                    to Central Asia. My wife was called every night four times for the first week at
                    2:00, 3:00, 4:00, and 5:00 o'clock in the morning. The phone rang, and there was
                    silence. This is harassment, I mean, for a wife. Every night she was awakened,
                    and there was just breathing and then hung up. That kind of thing. They were
                    harassed. There was no doubt about it. So it was a different atmosphere and a
                    different situation. It is a different atmosphere now in Moscow, an entirely
                    different kind of situation. But in those days, well, I think it probably had
                    even been different ten years before when the embassy—there was a mystique about
                    serving in Moscow. Those people who served there before 1953 and those who
                    served after 1953, the real old Moscow hands were the ones who had served there
                    before 1953 when our embassy was located on a street called Bukavaya Street,
                    which was right off Red Square. In the Stalin days, Stalin didn't want to have
                    the British and American embassies that close to Red Square, and we were told to
                    move. The Americans, in typical fashion, we moved. The British procrastinated,
                    and to this day they still have their beautiful—the located residence right
                    across the river from Red Square, looking onto Red Square. We moved to this
                    other embassy building, and this is where we're still now, pending our moving to
                    our new embassy compound. When that will be, I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>At any rate, what I did want to mention, in getting back to the substantive part,
                    I mentioned the roller coaster affair, which made it interesting for me, about
                    our relationship. The other thing was that in 1958, in January, before I got to
                    Moscow, we had signed our first cultural and scientific exchange agreement with
                    the Soviet Union, and that opened up the whole area of what I would call
                    cultural and informational relationship with the Soviet Union, whereby we
                    published the magazine America, which was distributed in the Soviet Union. That
                    is an entire chapter. We had our first performing arts groups coming with the
                    New York Philharmonic and “My Fair Lady” and Michigan University Concert Band,
                    and we had our first exchanges of cultural personalities, composers, painters,
                    and writers. I can name them, who they were, who participated. We had, first of
                    all, our first major exhibition, the American National Exhibition in Moscow, and
                    the Soviet National Exhibition in New York, which took place in '59.</p>
                <p>You really completely occupied yourself, so much so that everybody in Washington
                    and in Moscow—the ambassador and Mr. Allen and the State Department—agreed that
                    one cultural affairs and press officer could not do the job. I was supposed to
                    get an assistant. Everybody signed off on this, and it was always very
                    complicated because housing was so tight, and if a new officer was to be added
                    to the embassy, it was a very major bureaucratic process through which you went
                    before this position was approved. Well, it was approved. I was to get an
                    assistant. At the last moment, the decision was made in Washington that what we
                    really needed in Moscow at this stage was a high-ranking cultural counselor to
                    administer this huge new cultural affairs program. Of course, I was too low
                    grade for that position, so a cultural counselor at a very high grade was
                    assigned, and I became the assistant. So the moral of the story is, “Never ask
                    for an assistant, because you may be it.” I became the assistant to the cultural
                    counselor for the next two years of my assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>TUCH: Lee Brady. Lee Brady became my boss and served there for two years. His
                    assignment started off in a very, very, very bad way. This is, of course,
                    another chapter. When we will interview him, I will interview him personally,
                    but he went through the first local appendectomy in the American Embassy within
                    two months after he arrived. I was present in the operating room when it took
                    place, and it was done without the benefits of anesthetic. That was a horrible,
                    horrible experience, worse for me, witnessing such an operation in an operating
                    room where there were two other operations going on simultaneously in front of
                    you, a mangled arm and a fallopian pregnancy. The reason that took place is we
                    had a new embassy doctor. You asked me about medical arrangements earlier. We
                    had an embassy doctor who was normally an Air Force officer, one of the Air
                    Force slots to supply a medical officer to the American Embassy. They were
                    usually very good officers, very good doctors, medical doctors, and they really
                    were part of the family. The doctor who had been there had left. We had a new
                    doctor who was not an armed services officer, but a civilian, a marvelous
                    doctor, but he was new. Lee Brady came up with what he identified as a ruptured
                    appendix, and he really didn't know of any other way but to take him to the
                    diplomatic hospital. This is where this happened. We took him over, and they
                    performed the operation.</p>
                <p>The next morning, I walked into the room. Lee had fainted; he had been in deep
                    shock. He was in deep shock, and he was lying in bed, bare to his chest, and he
                    had these big red splotches on his chest. I said, “My God, what happened to you
                    now?”</p>
                <p>And he says, “You wouldn't know, Tom.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean, you wouldn't know? What is it? What are these red
                    splotches?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, they just cupped me.”</p>
                <p>I said, “They did what?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I knew you wouldn't know what this is. They cupped me.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What is cupping?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Look at this.” There were two cups on his night table, and they had put
                    these suction cups on his chest in order to get out the impurities of this blood
                    system.</p>

                <p>TUCH: Like leeches, but they didn't use leeches. They certainly used cups on him,
                    and this was sort of the . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Modern Soviet medical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Modern Soviet medical science. The story connected with this one—and I
                    might just go on and tell it—his incision drained for about six weeks, and
                    finally the doctor just put him on an airplane and shipped him out to
                    Copenhagen, and he was in Copenhagen for about three weeks to just get the
                    incision closed off and get him back into normal state.</p>
                <p>One of our first delegations I remember was a delegation of three American
                    surgeons from North Carolina, young American surgeons who were interested in
                    Soviet surgical procedures. They were taken in hand in the Soviet Union by a
                    professor by the name of Mischnevsky, who was the famous surgeon who had
                    invented the Soviet heart-lung machine. This is one of the things that they
                    wanted to examine. They had been there for about two weeks, and just before they
                    went back to the States, they came to some reception at the American Embassy,
                    and they were holding forth on the wonders of Soviet medicine and medical
                    treatment. I said, “Frankly, this is maybe true, but you ought to see or hear
                    about the other side of Soviet medicine. Come on over. I want you to meet my
                    boss, Lee Brady. Lee, tell your story.” And Lee did.</p>
                <p>One of the doctors said, “You know, Mr. Brady, frankly, I just do not believe
                    what you've told me, on the basis of my experience.”</p>
                <p>Lee Brady said, “Suit yourself. Don't believe me.”</p>
                <p>They went back to their host, Professor Mischnevsky, the next morning and said,
                    “We heard this crazy story at the American Embassy last night about one of the
                    embassy officers being cupped after an operation. You don't do this kind of
                    thing.”</p>
                <p>And Mischnevsky turned and said, “Of course we do this.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Would you do this?”</p>
                <p>“Of course. I do it all the time. Let me demonstrate it.” He showed them how he
                    administers cupping on the legs.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The doctor came back to the embassy just before he left and apologized to Lee
                    Brady. He said, “I have never, never in my life experienced anything like this
                    before, where you have, on one hand, a very, very advanced medical technology
                    science and, on the other hand, the treatment of patients at such a low grade.”
                    And that, as far as I'm concerned, throughout my experience there,
                    persisted—namely, that when the Soviets want to concentrate on one or another
                    development, whether it is in military technology or whether you put up a
                    Sputnik or to develop a heart-lung machine, they are able to do this, because
                    they can order their scientists into a certain channel, and they can pick the
                    best ones and say, “This is what you're going to be doing, and this is what
                    you're going to develop,” and they come up with some very, very fine things.
                    Whereas the regular, whether it's Soviet building technology or whether it's
                    Soviet medicine or whether it's the how the infantry operates in the Soviet
                    Union, it's at a very, very primitive level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a great fear, then, on the part of the embassy
                        personnel, of getting sick or having a major illness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Well, after that experience, when anybody even complained of a stomach
                    ache, the doctor would just pack you off with ice, with dry ice, [laughter] and
                    pack you off on the next plane to wherever the plane was going West, whether it
                    was Vienna or Copenhagen. No, at that time, you had maybe three, four times a
                    week foreign airplanes coming in, and whatever plane it was that day, he would
                    put you on it and out you go. He would not take another chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about buying dairy products. The
                        Americans bought the dairy products on the local economy, eggs and cheese
                        and so on. We're you concerned about pasteurization and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>TUCH: Yes. Never milk. We lived on powdered milk. The children—powdered milk was
                    it. Eggs, we did try to find on the Soviet economy, and they were expensive, but
                    you know, whatever you could. Again, if you had a shipment coming in from
                    Berlin, a food shipment, if you did go to the Berlin U.S. Army commissary and
                    somebody went out and bought for the embassy and made arrangements, say, 6,000
                    pounds of food to bring it in, sure, maybe we would take 100 cartons of eggs on
                    that particular shipment, but that was iffy, because eggs don't travel very
                    well. Sometimes, you know, you'd buy frozen food, and you'd have to escort it as
                    a courier from Berlin to Warsaw to Brest—it was Brest Litovsk—where the Soviet
                    border, where the passenger train, they changed the wheels because the gauge is
                    different. But on the baggage cars where the food was on, they actually had to
                    transfer from one baggage car to the next. I had the singular experience of
                    being an escort for a food shipment from Berlin, 6,000 pounds of food that I had
                    brought from Berlin to Warsaw to Brest. The train was three hours late, and they
                    changed the wheels on the passenger cars, but they refused to transfer the
                    shipment from one baggage car to the other, and I was on the platform arguing
                    with them that I wasn't going to leave without the food. He says, “Well, if you
                    don't want to leave without the food, you're going to stay right here in Brest,
                    because here goes your train.”</p>
                <p>I jumped on the train, and I arrived in Moscow, where we had our embassy truck
                    backed up to the train station. I got off without my food shipment, and I never
                    lived that down. As a matter of fact, they accused me of having done it on
                    purpose, because about half of the 6,000 pounds of food apparently was seafood
                    and fish, and the people knew I was allergic to seafood and fish, and they
                    accused me of doing it on purpose, of leaving the shipment in Brest. Well, you
                    see, what happened was—this was in October, and the shipment, in Brest it was
                    freezing, in Moscow it was not yet freezing. Fortunately, they brought the food
                    in 24 hours later, and it had not defrosted, so it wasn't lost. But there was
                    this chance. But this was the kind of experience that you would constantly have
                    in your food shipments to bring in things that you wanted to have.</p>
                <p>Sometimes we would go out as individuals or maybe as couriers. You had courier
                    runs to Helsinki, and if you went to Helsinki on a courier run, your first stop
                    would be at Stockman's Department Store. Now, Stockman's is the Macy's of
                    Helsinki, and it is a lovely, beautiful department store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went by train?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>TUCH: We went by train, yes. It was a 24-hour, 26-hour trip by train to Helsinki.
                    Stockman's was a marvelous, marvelous store. They catered to all the diplomats
                    in Moscow. When you arrived at Stockman's, because you didn't speak Finnish, the
                    first thing they would do is they would assign to you an interpreter who would
                    go throughout the store with you, take the orders, mark them down, make a list
                    of them. You would then give them a check, your own personal check on an
                    American bank, and you would forget about it. Stockman's would deliver the
                    shipment to you on your plane, to your compartment or to the baggage care, and
                    you would have it delivered. Stockman's became sort of the heaven of the
                    American and all the embassies in Moscow. Of course, they were doing this for a
                    good profit, but they really served us extremely well. It was very, very
                    nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me, it sounds that even in '59 and '60, the period that
                        you were there, Russia and Moscow sounds almost like a Third World country
                        today, almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Oh, in many, many, many—and in terms of amenities and living conditions and
                    food supplies, you know, every afternoon my wife would go to her favorite bread
                    store and wait in line for the bread to be delivered. Now, we wanted a certain
                    bread because we lived this particular bread, but if she did not go there that
                    afternoon and stand in line and wait for the bread shipment to arrive, she would
                    not have gotten it. She would have gotten bread, but not her variety of bread,
                    maybe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did not bake it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: No, no. They would come to the various stores to be delivered. But she got
                    very much used to it. I mean, this became natural. If there was a line, you
                    joined it, and then you asked what it was. [Laughter] So this became natural,
                    and there were a lot of jokes and a lot of stories. Maybe we should shut off
                    this with one wonderful anecdote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>TUCH: My favorite Soviet joke about the rumor that got around at this particular
                    Leningrad food store that caviar was going to be sold there one day. So of
                    course, during the night before, the line formed, and it was two blocks long by
                    the time the manager arrived to open the store in the morning. He looked at the
                    line, and he got up and said, “Citizens, this line is much too long. We're never
                    going to have enough caviar to accommodate all of you people here, so I might as
                    well make an arbitrary decision. I'm going to decide right now that all the Jews
                    in the line might as well go home. I'm not going to sell you any caviar.” So the
                    line got about half shorter; all the Jewish people left. And he came out two
                    hours later, and he says, “Gee, the line is still much too long. I'm not going
                    to have that much caviar available. So only members of the Communist Party are
                    going to get caviar. Everybody else go home.” And to make this story shorter,
                    after a half hour he came out and says, by this time, “Comrades, I'm still not
                    going to have enough caviar to go along, so only people who fought in the Great
                    Patriotic War and were present at the Siege of Leningrad are going to be able to
                    get caviar.” So the line got shorter again. And he came out and says, “Only
                    members of the Central Committee who fought in the Great Patriotic War and
                    participated in the siege of Leningrad are going to get any caviar today.” And
                    by that time it had been reduced to five people. And he said, “Okay, you five
                    people, you come on in.” He took them into the store, and he took them into his
                    office, and he sat them down and he says, “With you five comrades, I can be
                    absolutely frank. We never had any caviar. We don't have any caviar today, and
                    we will never have any caviar in the future.”</p>
                <p>Whereupon one says, “You see, the Jews won again. They could go home first.”
                    [Laughter]</p>
