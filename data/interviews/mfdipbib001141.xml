                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 11, 1992</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 11, 1992. This is an interview with
                        Ulrich A. Straus on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I
                        am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Rick you could give me a bit about your
                        background—where you were born, grew up, education, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I was born in Germany of German parents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: In the town of Wurzburg, which is in northern Bavaria. I left there at
                    the tender age of about nine months and went to Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in 1926.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. 1932 was during the Depression and my father was most fortunate to
                    get a job with a German record company to go to look at the possibility of an
                    expanding market in Japan. So he took off for Japan in 1932. In those days you
                    didn't travel with very young children and my brother had just been born so we
                    waited until early 1933 to follow him.</p>
                <p>Just before that Hitler came to power. So we were extremely fortunate. My father
                    soon switched to a British company, British Columbia Records.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it before for Deutsche Gramophone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, it was Polydor.</p>
                <p>Then British Columbia was sold out to Japanese interests and became part of the
                    conglomerate Nissan.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So I came to Japan at the age of six and entered initially into a German school
                    and then in 1936, when it was very apparent at what was going on in Germany, I
                    entered the American School in Japan. Again in 1938, as the war clouds gathered
                    in Europe, and East Asia, my father had the foresight to apply for an American
                    visa. That came through in 1940. In the summer of 1940 we all marched down to
                    the American Consulate in Yokohama and got an immigrant visa to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you learned any Japanese while you lived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, but less than you might think. My first language was German and my
                    second language was Japanese and my third language was American. In many
                    respects, I think, I was already Americanized before entering the United States.
                    In a way that was home. Certainly Germany wasn't home and certainly Japan wasn't
                    home, although we felt very comfortable in Japan. But all my friends at that
                    point were also leaving. I have often been asked whether Pearl Harbor was a big
                    surprise. My answer to that is that by the spring of 1941, the American School
                    in Japan had so few kids left that they didn't even bother to open in the fall
                    of 1941. This meant that practically everyone who could leave or felt they could
                    leave had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say by leaving Germany in 1933 and Japan in 1940,
                        you must have the feeling that the sleigh was going just before the wolves
                        jumped on you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: As an aside, my father left Seoul, Korea about three hours ahead of the
                    Communists in 1950.</p>
                <p>I went to high school in New York. During the war, I was a sophomore, I believe,
                    in high school, a gentleman whom we had known in Japan, Paul Rush, who had been
                    a kind of a teacher missionary and by then was Captain Rush, was going around
                    the country looking up the relatively few Americans who had lived in Japan prior
                    to the war to get them interested in going to the Army Language School when they
                    became the proper age. Of course I was interested, all of my old friends are
                    going to be there.</p>
                <p>In 1944 I graduated from high school. At that time I was still classified
                    technically as an enemy alien. But I set off for the University of Michigan
                    where this Army Language School course was being given. I found out there that I
                    couldn't take any civilian courses in Japanese because they had canceled them
                    for lack of teachers. But they allowed me as a civilian to go to the Japanese
                    Military Intelligence Service Language School, despite my enemy alien
                    classification.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>For almost a full year I did that. When I turned 18...you could draft aliens but
                    aliens could not volunteer...I joined that group and went to basic training.
                    While in basic training the Emperor decided to throw in the towel, in August
                    1945. I completed my military training and in January 1946 came back to Japan as
                    a second lieutenant.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter I was ordered to go to the Tojo trials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a military general who became Prime Minister in the
                        middle of the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Before the war. He led Japan into World War II.</p>
                <p>The reason I was picked was that I knew German and there weren't many people in
                    Japan in those days who knew German because all of those had been shipped to
                    Germany. I knew both Japanese and German. Along with some British Navy officers
                    I went through literally tons of German Foreign Office files that had been
                    shipped from Germany to us to go over for possible use by the prosecution
                    against the Japanese who were charged with waging aggressive war in collusion
                    with Germany and Italy.</p>
                <p>We wrote many pr�cis and after a while our British colleagues left and I was
                    still there. Then I was working with the lawyers making full translations of
                    these documents into the two official languages of the court, which were English
                    and Japanese. In fact I certified as to the accuracy of translation of those
                    documents. It may well have been the most responsible job I ever had, and at age
                    19.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting that you were a second lieutenant at age
                        19 without a college degree. Normally I thought you had to be the equivalent
                        of an adult which in those days was not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That's right. But I think before World War II it was much more common for
                    even regular officers not to have a degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Japan at this time? Were you
                        able to look up old friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Tokyo was smashed. I think something like 60 percent of Tokyo just didn't
                    exist any more. Other cities were burned even more to the ground. Seeing old
                    friends, of course, came with a sense of relief that they were still alive but
                    depressing the way they had to live in those days. I, along with everybody else,
                    would take some rations to them and help them out the best I could. The people I
                    knew generally were the lucky ones who had a place to live. But, what was
                    impressive, I guess, was that discipline didn't totally break down. People had
                    to go into the countryside to get food and bargain with the farmers. They would
                    go out with large rucksacks containing what little possessions they had been
                    able to save to bargain for food from the farmers. The farmers in those days
                    were the kingpins. They did very well.</p>
                <p>Train windows were smashed in because that was the only way people could get in
                    and out of cars. But there was virtually very little crime even though people
                    were literally starving to death. But there was a lot of sadness too.</p>
                <p>The Japanese at that time were very grateful to us because they had feared the
                    worse. The government had told them all the terrible things we were going to
                    do...rape, pillage and burn. And, of course, none of that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, here you were and you had been accustomed to
                        Japanese society, what was your impression as a young man of the impact
                        between the American forces, who were basically a group of pretty young guys
                        and not very sensitive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: First of all let me say that I knew very little about Japanese society.
                    My parents' interaction with the Japanese was very limited. The number of times
                    we had Japanese in our house I could probably count on the fingers of one hand
                    in a period of seven years. I had one friend, who lived in the neighbor, but by
                    in large my playmates were all from the American School and my whole life was
                    directed at the American School. So I am not sure I can really answer your
                    question. I was beginning to learn something about Japanese society at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions from what you were getting and
                        from others who were dealing with the Tojo trial, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The 28 class A war criminals were...I used to see them on the
                    bench...were beaten men. They were totally disgraced men. I think there was none
                    of the haughtiness that was demonstrated by some of the German war
                    criminals.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>One comment on the trial. I was a member of the prosecution and dealt with the
                    lawyers The prosecution was very much aware of the fact that the law they were
                    applying was largely ex post facto law. This is a charge that has been made
                    subsequently. But I think there was a feeling that we had very little choice in
                    the matter. We could not really do what the Russians probably would have
                    preferred to do and possibly the Chinese...stand the designated war criminals
                    against the wall and shoot them. We could not just let them go. We didn't feel
                    we could just turn them over to a weak and untested Japanese government. That
                    might not have been acceptable to the American public at all. So, I think, to
                    the Western public's putting them on trial was perhaps the only reasonable
                    political alternative.</p>
                <p>And we hoped it would have two results. That it might provide a deterrent for
                    future leaders and that it might provide education for the Japanese public, who
                    of course learned a great deal about their then recent history for the first
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the dissemination to the Japanese
                        people of what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, it was disseminated through the radio and newspapers. We controlled
                    everything so we could force the Japanese to do almost anything we wished. I
                    don't think, to be very truthful, that the Japanese had a great deal of interest
                    in it because they were interested in survival at that time. They didn't care
                    very much about anything that was going on in the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you have lost, you have lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: You are just interested in survival and getting back on your feet some
                    how.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling within the American military towards
                        General MacArthur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, you know, MacArthur never had the adoration of the troops as let's
                    say Eisenhower did. He was an aloof figure and a showman. My own feeling was
                    that perhaps he was a better administrator of Japan than he was a General. There
                    was a good deal of dissension below MacArthur. There were two most prominent
                    political wings, one conservative, under Major General Willoughby, who was in
                    charge of G-2 (Intelligence) and the other under General Whitney, who handled
                    the Government Section, the more liberally inspired section. Things got so bad
                    between the two sections that we were ordered not to talk to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in which?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STRAUS: After I left the war crimes trial, I was in G-2. But my best friend and
                    roommate was with the Government Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing when you left the trials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: For a bit I worked for G-2. The trials may have whetted my interest in
                    the Foreign Service and G-2 did some more because I was working in something
                    called G-2 Operations and our task was to put together what was known as an
                    intelligence summary of the day's happenings in the Far East Command, which was
                    MacArthur's command. Together with a number of other people, prominent among
                    whom was Tom Shoesmith, who later was DCM in Tokyo and ambassador to Malaysia,
                    we worked on the Japan part of that. So what we were doing was a kind of
                    journalistic reporting job of what was going on in Japan, on the political,
                    economic and social side of things. I contributed some writing to that. We were
                    hampered by the fact that the folks in Government Section which played a
                    behind-the-scenes role in Japanese politics would not talk to us and we could
                    not ever acknowledge the fact that the Japanese government was not a totally
                    free agent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since the war was over, what were the intelligence
                        concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The concerns in Japan were that we just wanted to know what was going on.
                    Of course, this was being read not just in Tokyo but by the commands below us.
                    There were still at that time about 100,000 troops in Japan. The military
                    concerns were largely outside. They dealt with some of the tense situations in
                    Korea between North and South and the successful campaign of the Communists in
                    China. There was also a great deal of interest about the communists in
                    Japan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I left Japan in 1948 and returned to the University of Michigan and got
                    myself an education. I had, perhaps, made a mistake when leaving the Service. I
                    was asked if I wanted to stay in the Army Reserve and I said, “Oh sure.” But
                    then when the Korean war came, June, 1950, not too long thereafter they recalled
                    me to active duty. I staved it off for a while but I finally decided there was
                    no point in fighting it and in 1951 I was back in the military, having been gone
                    only three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking at Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STRAUS: I decided that unlike many of my colleagues I wouldn't take a course on
                    Japan; I had had plenty of that. My undergraduate degree was in Japanese
                    language and literature, simply because of all the credits I had accumulated
                    during the war. But my Masters was in political science and I had just started
                    work on a Ph.D. in political science. Actually I had decided at that point to
                    get a law degree and was accepted by Yale Law School, but the next day I got
                    orders to report for military duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concentrating on any particular area in your
                        political science studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Not really. Eventually, yes, with my Ph.D. program it was Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, all of a sudden you are back in the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was clear the Army didn't have the foggiest notion what to do with me.
                    Perhaps the people who called me back didn't realize that Japanese was very
                    different from Korean. I couldn't speak a word of Korean. After languishing at
                    Fort Bragg, North Carolina, I volunteered to go to the Far East Command while
                    the war was raging and ended up in the same office I had occupied before in
                    Japan, G-2 Operations. I remained there for another year and a half and
                    eventually became a civilian and staying on for a while. Then I was doing the
                    bulk of the reporting on Japanese political developments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to Japanese political developments, since
                        you were in intelligence at the time...one of the major lapses in our
                        intelligence operation seemed to be figuring out the intentions of the
                        Chinese Communists. Would they enter the war or not? MacArthur came down
                        very strongly that they would not. Were you getting any emanations from this
                        thing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, that never concerned me. I got back to Japan after all this had
                    happened, in the latter part of 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you reading Japanese developments at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I arrived shortly after the peace treaty went into effect in the summer
                    of 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we reading developments in Japan from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STRAUS: At that time, I think we still viewed Japan as a country that we would be
                    lucky to get off our backs economically. It is hard to imagine today. But if I
                    had my wits about me that would have been the time to buy real estate on the
                    Ginza. But I didn't, obviously. The Japanese were still confused. I think that
                    there was a period after the war when in the Japanese mind everything Japanese
                    turned out to be bad, everything American was great. They really had a
                    180-degree turn. It was excessive before and I thought it was artificial and
                    excessive later. The fact that we went from an occupying power to an ally in
                    1952 really didn't make a lot of difference. It took almost a decade before
                    things really changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any political developments that were of
                        concern at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, I think there were concerns. Japan at that time was sharply divided
                    between a group of conservative parties at that time and a Communist Party which
                    at that time was sort of swinging wildly back and forth between Beijing and
                    Moscow in their alliance. They had resorted to a certain amount of violence to
                    support their North Korean friends.</p>
                <p>Perhaps more worrisome then anything else, there was a Socialist Party which was
                    strongly supported by a labor union movement, which in its outlook was hard to
                    distinguish from that of the Communists. They espoused the Marxist-Leninist
                    doctrine. They demonstrated none of the anti-Soviet attitudes that you were
                    starting to find in Western Europe at that time. It wasn't very clear to us, and
                    for some time thereafter, whether the Socialists, with or without Communist
                    allies, ever could get into power legitimately and whether they could then be
                    trusted to relinquish power. This was the kind of thing we experienced in Italy,
                    too, I think.</p>
                <p>In terms of domestic politics that was a concern. A second concern was that we
                    wanted Japan to get back up on its feet and start contributing in a military
                    sense so that we wouldn't have to spend resources to defend them, and perhaps in
                    an economic sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: In 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that you had participated in
                        something that later would be considered a model occupation, etc.? You had
                        hit it twice. Did you feel that at least Japan was heading in the right
                        direction and things were coming out better then could have happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STRAUS: I wasn't all that analytical at that time. I had other interests that I
                    was pursuing. But I think that I was aware of the fact that given how fierce the
                    war had been fought, how extreme the emotions were in both countries about each
                    other, how often racists they were, on both sides, that we were awful lucky how
                    well things turned out.One reason of course was that the incoming troops, the
                    first wave, perhaps more than the second or third wave, were very relieved to
                    get to Japan. Japan, as bad as it was, once you got out of the big cities, was a
                    lot better than what these guys had gone through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some were sitting on horrible little islands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, fighting in New Guinea, the Philippines, the islands across the
                    Pacific...everything was better in Japan. So that helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking from my experience, I came in in 1952, but there
                        was a real fascination by that time with Japan by the troops. One, of
                        course, was girls. This was a real delight. I recall that in my oral exam to
                        get into the Foreign Service one question was what I had observed about the
                        constitution of Japan. For me it was sex. There also became a delight in the
                        architecture, etc. There was a marriage there that was hard to
                        understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think we got a whole generation, frankly, of Foreign Service officers,
                    college professors, businessmen involved with Japan from the group of Army and
                    Navy officers who had studied the language. They were particularly interested in
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Japan and what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I went back to the University. I had given up the idea of going to law
                    school. It was a little bit daunting, perhaps, and I had been independent and I
                    thought, “Well, I will get a Ph.D. in political science with the idea of getting
                    into the Foreign Service.” So that is what I did. I spent the next two years at
                    the University of Michigan finishing up course work and doing some teaching
                    there. Then I got a Fulbright and was back in Japan working on my Ph.D. The
                    subject was the Upper House of the Japanese Diet. I was nominally attached to
                    Keio University. I was one of the first foreign students attached to Keio
                    University, one of the best private universities in Tokyo.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>By then I was getting interested in Japanese society, but perhaps not interested
                    enough because I had an interesting episode at that point. This was in 1955. I
                    let it be known that I was interested in skiing and wanted very much to join the
                    ski club. Predictably the members of the ski club were just delighted that a
                    foreigner, an American, wished to join them. They were curious about me too. But
                    then we started talking about taking a ski trip together. They were all
                    enthusiastic and then a thought occurred to them and they said, “Well, it is
                    very difficult. We sleep on tatami mats. We don't have beds, we stay in Japanese
                    inns.” I said, “That is no problem I have stayed that way many times. No
                    problem.” Great relief. Then, “But, we eat Japanese food. We eat raw fish.” I
                    said, “I love Japanese food. I eat it all the time.” Great relief. Then a little
                    more time passed and they said, “Oh, there is one other thing we want you to
                    know. We get up every morning at 7:00 and about 7:30 we go out into the snow and
                    have our exercises. Then at 8:00 we have our breakfast and at 8:30 we all wax
                    the skis. We are out on the slopes at 9:00 and at 10:30 we have the first smoke
                    break....”</p>
                <p>Well, you get the picture. I regret very much that I said, “I just got out of the
                    Army recently and I didn't really want to do that.” But I got an interesting
                    lesson on how the Japanese do things. This was not the ski team, this was the
                    club!</p>
                <p>I was in Tokyo from September, 1955 until early 1957. In late 1955 I took the
                    Foreign Service examination at the Embassy. I was fortunate enough to pass it.
                    In the following year I took the oral exam and got through that. I joined in
                    1957, in April. I was at that time 30 years old. Pretty long of tooth.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. I had had five years in the military plus many years trying to get a
                    Ph.D., which I never finished.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: I had the A-100 course and that is all. I didn't want to go right back to
                    Japan so I opted to stay in Washington and ended up in INR working on Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you realize when you came into the Foreign Service
                        that with your obvious talent in the culture and language that very few
                        Americans had that this was going to be pretty much your concentration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, I did. But there were a lot of others, of course, who also had these
                    war time language experiences, both navy and army, who were very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in INR from 1957-59. How did INR work at the
                        time? What sort of information were you getting and what were you doing with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I remember in particular two things. One was early morning briefings for
                    the Director. We would come in around 5:30 or so and, not just on Japan, but
                    East Asia in general, we looked at all the news that came in over night and
                    briefed those things that were of possible interest to the seventh floor. That
                    was one thing.</p>
                <p>Then I worked interminably on something called the NIS, National Intelligence
                    Summary, which was a CIA project. I became undoubtedly the world's greatest
                    expert on middle schools in Okinawa, which, of course, was invaluable later on
                    to my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was something that CIA sponsored that every one of us
                        who served in INR worked on, which was to be the great treatise on anything,
                        anywhere at anytime. So if we ever went to war we would know whether or not
                        to bomb middle schools in Okinawa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was an amazing amount of money that went into that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: But I was so happy to be in the Foreign Service. I was gung ho.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression of your Foreign Service class

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, I think it greatly varied. But it was a sense of adventure and a
                    sense of service for most people. And, perhaps, contrasted to today, I have the
                    feeling that most felt this was something they would do for the rest of their
                    lives. We had two women in our class, both of whom left within four or five

                <p>STRAUS: I was not married. I married just before I left Washington on my first
                    overseas assignment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. We used to go around and brief the Desks, also. So I got to know the
                    people on the EA Desks. It was a big thrill in those days. It was all new and
                    different. I guess I learned a little bit how to write Foreign Service
                    style.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: I was initially slated to go to Nagoya where we had a Consulate at the
                    time. That was changed at the last moment and I was sent to the Embassy
                    political section in Tokyo as the most junior of junior officers.</p>

                    fall into anyone else's bailiwick. I think to some extent it included things
                    like the judiciary and court cases. I remember writing a report on a big
                    typhoon. Sort of odds and ends. I did that for a year.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: I would guess about 12 people. It was getting to be fairly big.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Embassy? At that time
                        Douglas MacArthur II, a career Foreign Service officer and nephew of the
                        General, was Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, he was.</p>
                <p>I was in Japan in 1955 when he was appointed and I thought that it was a big
                    mistake to appoint anyone with that name. But the Japanese saw it differently.
                    He had been the Counselor in the Department, a man who obviously had the ear of
                    the Secretary of State, one of the high and mighty and the Japanese were
                    flattered to get an important person like that.</p>
                <p>However, I found the Embassy was not a very happy place. In fact, compared to all
                    the others places I have been subsequently, it was a very unhappy place. I
                    remember one incident, for example, this was a time of turmoil in the spring of
                    1960 with a lot of demonstrations going on...[second side of first tape]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that you sat in on a meeting with Douglas
                        MacArthur.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, indeed. The Ambassador held forth for all but a minute of this 50
                    minute interview where he tried to persuade the president of a prominent
                    university that these demonstrations against the security treaty, against Kishi,
                    the Prime Minister at the time, were all wrong. And that it was his Christian
                    duty, as it were, to oppose this kind of thing. At the end of that 50 minutes,
                    he was rather summarily dismissed and thanked for contributing his views, which
                    the man never had the chance to do. I think that was kind of the way MacArthur
                    ran things.</p>
                <p>At a later point we were asked our thoughts about the Eisenhower Presidential
                    visit and it was clear to everybody, at least below the DCM level, that it
                    needed to be postponed. But at that point I think the Ambassador's ego was
                    involved in the visit and he wanted to continue it until finally the Japanese
                    indicated that they were concerned about the safety of the Emperor as much as
                    anything. Protocol demanded that the Emperor go out to the airport. So at their
                    insistence it was postponed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These demonstrations were over a security treaty we were
                        developing with the Japanese. How were we reading this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, let me go back. As part of the peace treaty of 1952 we had
                    negotiated with Japan a security treaty which allowed for the stationing of
                    American forces in Japan. By 1959, with Japan starting to feel more independent,
                    it was clear that the treaty that had been negotiated earlier was not adequate.
                    It had to be revised because it provided for such things as the possibility of
                    American forces interfering militarily in Japan. That wasn't appropriate any
                    more. So it was revised really to provide more powers to the Japanese and to
                    limit American powers. So there was nothing wrong with that except that the left
                    wing force in Japan didn't want any security treaty. They wanted so-called
                    unarmed neutrality and to rest their security on the tender mercies of the
                    United Nations as well as non-aggression pacts with the United States, the
                    Soviet Union and China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those of you who were dealing with these groups, how were
                        you reading these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think our reading was that these demonstrations in Japan, which were, I
                    think, conveyed in the press to the American public as being anti-American
                    demonstrations, were only partly that. That the majority focus, maybe 70
                    percent, was really directed against Mr. Kishi, then the Prime Minister. Kishi's
                    background was that he had been a very prominent politician, a member of the
                    wartime Tojo cabinet and got within a whisker of being tried as an A Class war
                    criminal. He was probably the most conservative of the post-war Japanese
                    politicians. A very wily politician.</p>
                <p>It was Kishi's somewhat Japanese idea that the revised security treaty should be
                    a present for Eisenhower. It should all have been wrapped up by the time he
                    came. But given the opposition to this treaty among the trade unions and the
                    left wing in Japanese politics, it became impossible to get it through without
                    ramming it through...what the Japanese call the tyranny of the majority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than reaching the sort of consensus which was the
                        normal Japanese way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. It was then that the anger of a lot of middle-of-the-road people
                    also exploded. It was roughly 70 percent directed towards Kishi. Maybe another
                    20 percent against having the security treaty with the United States and 10
                    percent against the planned Eisenhower visit. I think maybe the Japanese were in
                    a way disappointed that the President of the United States wouldn't come. So I
                    think there was at least on the part of the press in the United States a
                    misreading of this. I am not so sure that our reporting at that time carried the
                    full flavor of what these demonstrations were all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the reporting? Obviously as a junior
                        officer...they tend to focus more on the opposition...this is sort of a
                        traditional role that they always feel that the old guard at the top sits on
                        what they have to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The reporting first of all was excessive. MacArthur had a way...he was an
                    early riser and by the time he came to the office he had read the
                    English-language Japan Times, which was his bible. He would mark virtually all
                    the articles that dealt with Japanese domestic or international affairs for
                    reporting. We were required to report them even if the articles turned out to be
                    false. I remember I was told, “Well, then you say that the Times said this but
                    on further checking it wasn't true.” So it was excessive. I felt that the lower
                    ranks, certainly people like Dave Osborn, knew the score exceedingly well. But
                    the reporting that was done above the political counselor level was often
                    slanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say also excessive, were you finding yourself
                        getting down to the county level? Were you learning an awful lot about Japan
                        that you might not have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, yes. I learned and particularly...you see I did this job for one year
                    and then I became the assistant labor attach�. For a language officer that was a
                    fabulous job. My boss, the labor attach�, was Lou Silberberg, a very fine
                    individual with a tin ear. Despite having been in Japan eventually for ten
                    years, and getting along very well with the Japanese and learning a lot about
                    Japan, never had the slightest facility for Japanese. Like most people he didn't
                    particularly like to work through interpreters so his contacts were generally
                    with the Labor Ministry and with the ILO office and the ICFTU office and left
                    the labor leaders to me because there wasn't one who spoke any English.</p>
                <p>That was great stuff, particularly as the labor unions were the bulk of the
                    people out on the streets demonstrating against the government. That was a very
                    exciting time for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have put a lot of attention into labor movements around
                        the world, and the Japanese was one of the major ones. We made certain
                        calculations early on that this would come out all right, didn't we? It was
                        one of the big debates with General MacArthur...whether to have labor unions
                        or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, that was never a matter of debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there something about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I think you are referring to the general strike which was called
                    and which he cracked down on early on in the occupation.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the labor movement in those days? This was
                        in 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I learned a lot. I learned that the rhetoric was often very extreme
                    and hardly distinguishable from that of the Communists. And that sometimes the
                    private views of these labor leaders was much more moderate. Was that important?
                    I got along pretty well with them. There was a difference between the government
                    unions and non-government unions. The non-government unions in the private
                    sector from the beginning were much more moderate because they often identified
                    their interests with their employers. On the other hand, the railway workers,
                    teachers union, etc. were implacable foes of their employer—the Government.</p>
                <p>I do recall talking to a journalist friend of mine about the head of SOHYO, the
                    then Japanese equivalent of the AFL-CIO, on the left side of the spectrum. I
                    said, “Mr. Ota, the President of SOHYO said this and that.” I rather took
                    exception to his strong views on American policy, whatever it was at the time. I
                    said, “Why does he keep saying these things?” “Ah,” said my friend. “You don't
                    understand. Mr. Ota really comes from the private section unions and his
                    personal views are known to be very moderate. Therefore he has to take special
                    pains to express radical views in public.” So that was another lesson about
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is always one of the hardest things. An officer who
                        gets down and gets more intimate with labor and political leaders can often
                        see what is going on underneath. Yet your masters at the top of the Embassy
                        see a different picture because in a way they say, “This is all very nice
                        but this is what their official position is.” And this is what gets
                        reported. Did you find yourself having a problem of translating this within
                        the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, although I have to agree too that yes they may be moderate in the
                    inner circles which usually doesn't get out. It is very hard in a society like
                    Japan to figure out to what extent this alleged moderation translates itself
                    into action or, as the case may be, lack of action. We never really know that.
                    At least we certainly didn't then. We may have a little bit more insights today
                    than we had then about what was going on within the decision making inner
                    circles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude towards the labor movement at that
                        time? Being the assistant labor attach� did you feel the heavy hand of the
                        AFL-CIO and its attitude which is violently anti-Communist and anti-left
                        because it was controlled by former Communists who were in...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>STRAUS: There was a great deal of interest in the labor movement. Many of them
                    came to visit on exchange programs. We sent teams of labor leaders to the United
                    States under the so-called productivity councils. It turned out that all these
                    people who went to the United States took very extensive notes and learned a
                    great deal about productivity in the United States which they diligently applied
                    to their own workshops. I am not so sure, frankly, that the American labor
                    leaders who came to Japan were as diligent in learning about Japan, with one
                    possible exception. That was the Reuther brothers, Walter and Victor. They came
                    to Japan repeatedly, especially Victor. They certainly stand out as being very
                    serious people, not just being interested in getting entertained. They were
                    trying to learn about the Japanese system.</p>
                <p>Sure, elements of the Japanese labor movement were not with the
                    ICFTU—International Confederation of Free Trade, headquartered in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was set up as a counter to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The WFTU, which was Communist. It was headquartered in Prague, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>The SOHYO unions were not affiliated with the WFTU, but they were very close to
                    the WFTU unions, nevertheless. But again a fair number of these people on a
                    personal basis were very approachable and would tell you a good deal of what was
                    planned. They just shared the views of many Japanese at that time that a close
                    alliance with the United States was not a good thing. It was seen that the
                    United States would possibly lead Japan into a war not of its choosing,
                    particularly against China. You recall we had this very bitter anti-Communist
                    China policy at the time. We had literally forced the Japanese to recognize
                    Taipei; otherwise they would not have done so. With bases on Japanese soil this
                    was not totally a wild notion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Okinawa...at that time Okinawa was not part of
                        Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was not. It was administered as an American fiefdom. John Foster
                    Dulles came up with an interesting notion in international law that the Japanese
                    retained sovereignty but we exercised sovereignty—residual sovereignty was what
                    the Japanese had. I should say, of course, it was an interesting period. I
                    wasn't involved with Okinawa at the time. At that point Ambassador Reischauer
                    had come in with the Kennedy administration, replacing MacArthur. He had some
                    problems with the Commanding General on Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Reischauer? Here was a man who
                        was the guru of Japanese and Chinese studies from Harvard.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Well it was a major change from MacArthur to Reischauer. It was a more
                    relaxed style of leadership. For example, the Embassy had a swimming pool which
                    nobody other than the Ambassador and DCM could ever use. Immediately that was
                    opened to everybody which greatly endeared the Reischauers to us. We got to know
                    them as people and they were delightful. Politically his views were very close
                    to what I felt about Japan. He, of course, was a graduate of the American School
                    of Japan like I was. Haru Reischauer, his wife, was a graduate of that school as
                    well. I had known her younger sisters. So they were very fine people. I think
                    the views, particularly of Dave Osborn, one of the shining lights of the Foreign
                    Service and certainly in the Japan and China service, were very much taken to
                    heart by the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a feeling after the abortive Eisenhower trip,
                        which stands out as a real shock to Japanese-American relations, that we had
                        to get this relationship back together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Reischauer, of course, had written an article for Foreign Affairs which,
                    I guess, Kennedy had read and decided to make him Ambassador. He spelled out a
                    number of things that needed to be done. Immediately relations were established
                    at a high level by the Ambassador himself with people on the left, which
                    included much of the academic establishment, where, of course, his credentials
                    were superb. And also with the left wing politicians, leaving aside the
                    Communist Party, and the trade union movement. Sure, I and others had relations
                    with them, but it was a different thing for the top level of the Embassy also to
                    see them and invite them to Embassy functions. It was very different. It was
                    very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under the MacArthur and the Reischauer regimes, were there
                        people that you could not deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, I think it was our view that we shouldn't deal with the Communist
                    Party. And we didn't. That really didn't change, but I don't think there was
                    much to gain at that time. They were still very much kept under either Moscow's
                    or Beijing's sway. We weren't going to get anything that wasn't in the official
                    newspaper, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time what was the feeling you were getting about
                        how the Japanese viewed both Communist China and the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STRAUS: There was a great distinction that the Japanese have always drawn between
                    the Soviet Union and China. They were never, I think, as persuaded as we were of
                    the unity of those two countries. There was always a feeling that some how or
                    other they could get along with the Chinese; that there was a great deal of
                    affinity between them. There was also a feeling of some shame and remorse of
                    what the Japanese had done in China, and the feeling that they hadn't really
                    squared accounts with them. They did not feel any sense of threat like we did.
                    Therefore there was a divergence in our policy, very clearly. There was a time
                    when I think we feared the Communist Chinese more than the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The Soviet Union was a very different matter. The Japanese did not feel any sense
                    of remorse vis-a-vis the Soviets. After all it was the Soviets who attacked
                    them, not vice versa and they attacked them at the very end of the war and then
                    took a good deal of booty. Not only the northern territories and Karafuto
                    (Sakhalin) but in Manchuria and the Japanese infrastructure there. Then, perhaps
                    worst of all, they kept hundreds of thousands of Japanese in captivity. They
                    were sent to work camps and many did not survive that. So there is a very strong
                    negative feeling which survives even to this day in Japan about the Soviet
                    Union. But, as you recall, our view at that time was that Communism was
                    universal and undistinguished whether you were talking about Albania or
                    Czechoslovakia, North Korea, or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get involved with our relations with the
                        American military in Japan? Was it a problem for the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Not at that time. There were people who dealt with that. Bob Fearey was
                    one who dealt with that. And Buck Borg was the other. That was their main thing.
                    It was usually things that arose out of the management of the security treaty
                    and agreements that dealt with the utilization of the bases.</p>
                <p>There was a problem throughout that period in the sixties, which I dealt with
                    later in Washington, on pressure from the Japanese about wanting to get some
                    bases back. But it wasn't something that we couldn't deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to being the assistant labor attach�, just to
                        get a feel for the period within the Foreign Service, were you concerned
                        that by being there, although you were part of the political section, that
                        this would taint you as not being a regular FSO or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I wasn't worried about it that much. I didn't really want to be a labor
                    attach� the rest of my life. But on the other hand I had not gone through any
                    labor course. Whether it existed then I don't know. But I had no such
                    concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I might say one thing about the demonstrations. We used to have demonstrations in
                    front of the Embassy. We had large demonstrations there. But unlike, I guess
                    certain other countries, I never felt insecure. These were all well
                    choreographed Japanese demonstrations with the police on one side and the
                    demonstrators on the other. Both sides were careful not to step on the grass.
                    Indeed I can recall leaving the Embassy and walking right through the
                    demonstrators and not having any thought in my head that anything could happen
                    to me. I don't think I would do that in certain other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we read these demonstrations? Who was organizing
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: There were different groups that were involved. The largest groups were
                    always the trade unions. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the Japanese
                    government really didn't have much to worry about so long as only the students
                    were demonstrating and even if some Communists were demonstrating along side.
                    When the trade unions joined then it became a really serious matter and it
                    became at least a threat that the government could be toppled by that. In a
                    sense the demonstrations did remove Kishi from office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the students at that time. In some countries
                        students are expected to be as radical as all hell. In Korea, students
                        generally are anti-American but as soon as they get out they basically put
                        on another hat and join the establishment. What sort of contact did you have
                        with the teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: We had friends at the university level and some of whom said they used to
                    go to demonstrations, it was the thing to do. Anybody who was anybody
                    participated in the demonstrations. It was considered less as something
                    anti-American but to get rid of this son-of-a-gun Kishi. It was also a sense of
                    adventure. It was fighting the police, and that was a good thing. It was the
                    “democratic” thing to do. For a Japanese at that time, I can understand that. To
                    demonstrate your democratic instinct you fought against the government as your
                    first chance to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also there was more of a sense of participation. You put
                        on a headband. You had kind of a uniform to demonstrate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was a phase in your life. And as you said, some of the business
                    leaders had the wit to hire some of these people, the leaders even. They felt
                    they showed leadership qualities that they wanted in their business. It was a
                    little more difficult to get into government with that background and record,
                    but not impossible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our analysis that you were seeing of the
                        university system? Often it is sort of at the assistant professor instructor
                        level who are the great instigators of this who haven't quite gotten rid of
                        their undergraduate thoughts. Was that still true there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, very much so. You know the Japanese are not great individualists and
                    certainly at that time the thing to be in the university if you wanted to get
                    ahead was to be a Marxist. That was certainly true in the social sciences.
                    Indeed some of the students were telling me at the time that if your papers
                    didn't have a Marxist bias, you might as well forget about a good grade. And
                    that was something that worried us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was much of a spill over into the
                        thinking later on, or was this something that the people who were doing well
                        could shuck very easily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: There was a spill over for a while. You did have even then in the large
                    industries an element in their twenties who were rather radical, but gradually
                    they turned. Some never did change. Some of the journalists, for example, and
                    opinion leaders. So Marxism in its rather strange and extreme Japanese form did
                    persist in Japan longer then say in Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Japan...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, I still had one more year in Japan. I was in charge of the Socialist
                    Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, keeping contacts in the Socialist Party and reporting on it, the
                    main opposition party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time did you see the Socialist Party presenting
                        much of an alternative to the Liberal Democrats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I am afraid we did. We thought that the economic basis in Japan by the
                    mid-sixties, with rapid industrial growth and rising living standards was not
                    all that different from Western Europe and that you would have a moderation of
                    the Socialist Party, such as you had in Germany, France and England. And it
                    didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at them in a sort of benign way...this is
                        the group that will eventually take over?</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>STRAUS: We tried to, but the party split and you had some fairly conservative
                    elements which eventually formally split off and you had some people in the
                    middle. Then you had the majority very radical elements in the Socialist Party,
                    which for a long time prevailed and set the tone for the Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you were following the Party's strategic moves,
                        did you think they were doing the right thing at the time? Or did it seem to
                        be an odd socialist party as compared to some of the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, we probably exaggerated those occasional mild shifts to the center
                    because through the sixties and the seventies not all that much changed. You did
                    have some changes, but it was so much slower than what took place in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it today, were we missing anything that
                        was happening with the Socialists as far as how we were reporting on it,
                        because they are still not in power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The right wing Socialists who in many respects were the easiest for
                    Americans to talk to, proved singularly inept in getting themselves elected and
                    staying in the Diet. So they have lost out. The centrist have done somewhat
                    better. Perhaps they were seen as not really Japanese enough. I think we may
                    have underestimated the LDP, the conservatives. They, of course, have presided
                    over an unparalleled economic growth and prosperity and peace. That is a very
                    strong prescription for staying in office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about the basic corruption or was
                        that not much of a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, there was always some corruption and then, as now, it is less about
                    personal aggrandizement and venality as it is about power. Being in politics
                    requires a lot of money and the election laws are very strict, very idealistic,
                    if you will. Then there is going to be corruption. It is very much part of
                    Japanese society that you have gift giving. That smoothes entrees into
                    difficult, personal relationships. You are required as a politician to go to a
                    lot of weddings and funerals, etc. Every time you do it requires a gift. So it
                    is not surprising, although I think it has been excessive in the last few years.
                    At that time it was less. By and large, I think the Japanese were less corrupted
                    then than they are today.</p>

                    section. Obviously the person who reported on the Socialists was the more junior
                    officer. I don't think we had any great differences of view, but I did get to
                    know some of the Socialists and having been the assistant labor attach� and
                    knowing the labor types...some of them had previously been in the labor
                    movement. That was one way to get rid of more senior labor leaders, to send them
                    off to the Diet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Japan in late 1964. How did you feel about
                        whither Japan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: By that time I think it was pretty clear that Japan was on the move. I
                    don't think I or anybody else thought that their success would be as fast. I was
                    concerned already then about Vietnam, about our growing involvement there. It
                    was clear to me, perhaps because I was working for Reischauer, who was opposed
                    to this adventure from the very beginning because it could cause a rift in our
                    relationship with Japan. So I looked at it perhaps differently than my
                    colleagues did later on in Berlin. Perhaps having lived in Japan I had absorbed
                    some of the attitudes towards China...that China not being the unalterable enemy
                    of the United States that it later proved to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape two, side one of an interview with Ulrich A.
                        Straus. We are doing this on January 12, 1993. Rick we got you out of Japan
                        in 1965 and we are sending you to Berlin where you served from 1965-67. What
                        were you doing there and how did you get that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The reason I got the assignment was that I had been designated a labor
                    officer and had spent three years in Tokyo as the assistant labor attach�.
                    Berlin had had a close tie with the AFL-CIO. It had a tremendous impact there
                    already from before the time the Wall went up, but particularly afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the Berlin Wall which went up in
                        1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STRAUS: I got there four years later. Berlin, as it had been for a long time, was
                    a Social Democratic city with a strong labor union movement and the AFL-CIO saw
                    the workers in Berlin as the backbone of the resistance against Communism. Jay
                    Lovestone, who was the international director for the AFL-CIO, took a personal
                    interest in that Berlin connection. So I was charged to go out there and be the
                    labor officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the strong connection of the AFL-CIO in Europe did
                        you feel that you were dealing with an extra force other than the Department
                        of State when you came back and briefed, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, they were certainly major players at that time in anything
                    affecting the trade union movements. At the time there was tremendous
                    competition between East and West, between the ICFTU on the Western side and the
                    WFTU on the Eastern side and Berlin, of course, was the place par excellence for
                    competition between those two organizations and what they stood for. And Berlin,
                    of course, was seen as the great citadel of freedom in the sea of Communism,
                    which Jay Lovestone and others who were converts from the Communist cause tended
                    to romanticize somewhat. Berlin, of course, was a very hard-line city. At the
                    time I was there Berlin was a divided city, and West Berlin was the largest
                    industrial city between Moscow and Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come back to Washington before going to
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, on consultation. I never had the labor course. I succeeded in
                    avoiding that. But I did have my meetings with Lovestone and Irving Brown, who
                    was his deputy at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these men strike you? These are very important
                        figures in our policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, Lovestone, in particular, was a zealot. He had been a Communist
                    zealot and then became an anti-Communist zealot. Coming from Tokyo it struck me
                    as somewhat excessive and I had that feeling while I was in Berlin, too. I can
                    talk about that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I am just trying to get the feeling. When you were in
                        the State Department and getting your briefing, I realize you were a
                        relatively mid-grade officer. The Secretary of State wasn't exactly calling
                        you in. But the point was that when you were going out as the labor officer,
                        did the Desk officer sort of roll his eyes when you said you would be
                        talking with Lovestone, etc.? What was the relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STRAUS: I don't think there was any rolling of eyes, but it was made very clear
                    to me that the AFL-CIO did have a particular interest in nurturing this
                    relationship with the West Berlin union movement as a political statement and
                    that it was very important to them, and to us.</p>
                <p>Not long after I was there I had one of the really interesting thing happen to my
                    assignment there. It was on the anniversary of the day the Wall went up, June
                    17. There was a message sent by the President and one sent by the AFL-CIO. The
                    bearer of the message was the head of the NAACP. The rally was conducted next to
                    the burned out hulk of the Reichstag which was right next to the Wall. There
                    were about 350,000 people out there. My task was to translate this fairly brief
                    statement of support from the AFL-CIO and the President into German. It was the
                    only time I have ever spoken to 350,000 people. Everybody was there. It was
                    something special.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation...we got you in 1965, you
                        have been briefed and you were told to keep up the good work, I
                        suppose...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: To be the liaison with the trade union movement. I soon found out that
                    there wasn't really very much to this job. The reason being was that the West
                    Berlin union movement was really part of the West German union movement and that
                    the trade union negotiations took place in Bonn and elsewhere in Germany, but
                    not in Berlin.</p>
                <p>One of my unusual jobs there was as follows. We had in West Berlin West German
                    civil guards. The civil guards were not military but did have military training
                    who were kind of an auxiliary force for the rather meager Allied military
                    resources in Berlin. They were ostensively hired by us and we conducted the wage
                    negotiations. We, being the British, the French and the Americans. But that too
                    was a sham because the money was being provided by the German government and it
                    was essentially the German government which decided how much they should get
                    paid. So we fronted for the German government in this respect. That was one of
                    my functions.</p>
                <p>But things were going along rather well, so I didn't see where my predecessor
                    could have spent so much time on these. But anyway, it was pleasant enough. Very
                    nice people. There was a certain political significance in all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Mission in Berlin set up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was a State Department Mission headed by a somebody with the rank of
                    Minister, who ostensibly reported to the American Commandant, who had the
                    American Sector in West Berlin. And there were similar arrangements by the
                    British and the French.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Under the Minister you had a political section and economic section. Then you had
                    a section that dealt with East Germany. Since we didn't have any representation
                    over there, they did all the reporting on East Germany. Of course, that was a
                    very important part of it. And then there was a consular section. It was set up
                    like an embassy. There was a certain amount of natural tension built in between
                    Bonn and Berlin because Berlin reported separately. It didn't report through
                    Bonn although during my time I don't think there was any real conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Minister at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Arch Calhoun was there the first year and then he was replaced by
                    Brewster Morris, also a German hand.</p>
                <p>I was in the political section. After about a year I was able not to change jobs
                    but in addition to the labor job I had, which I didn't feel filled my time
                    adequately, I became the Berlin access officer. That I found much more to my
                    liking. It was much more interesting. That labor experience was the last of my
                    labor experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the access officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The whole issue of access to Berlin by the Allies. This was air access,
                    the air routes, barge access, rail access and autobahn access.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually this was the issue on which many people, myself
                        included, felt was the prime possibility for World War III. And this went on
                        for 20-30 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. The issues very often were as follows. We recognized the Soviet
                    ability to exercise some control over the access. In other words they could
                    check papers, but they couldn't inhibit us in any way. But we would reject any
                    efforts on the part of the East Germans to exercise this checking facility. So
                    we would show papers on the autobahn, for example, and elsewhere, to the Russian
                    authorities, but not to the East German authorities. Many of the problems arose
                    in the air corridors which was the most neuralgic point, perhaps, although the
                    autobahn was too.</p>
                <p>In my time there were no really serious incidents, but a lot of minor
                    incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? Was this a fencing matter or was it
                        really the local level people getting deciding to get a little more? What
                        was our analysis at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Things in Berlin at that time had a tendency to escalate very rapidly
                    into the highest level of government. A lot of the issues, actually, were
                    settled locally. But certain issues that struck people as dangerous, as a
                    slippery slope...if we gave in to the Soviets on this minor little issue, then
                    we could lose the whole ball game. You know things at that time were such that a
                    lieutenant who was in his little jeep driving the autobahn was wired to
                    communicate with the President of the United States, in case he had to make a
                    decision of what to do.</p>
                <p>I think a typical issue along those lines was the following one. One day the
                    Russians declared to us that they were going to do some repaving of the road, or
                    something connected with the autobahn and that would require that our
                    convoys...we had these eight vehicle convoys ...would have to park just off the
                    autobahn in a parking lot when processing papers. Well, we recognized their
                    right to process our papers, but we felt that if they could tell us to get off
                    the autobahn there, they could tell us to get off the autobahn everywhere.</p>
                <p>This was a hot and heavy issue. The Russians said they needed to do this because
                    there was a lot of increased traffic on the autobahn. And there was by the
                    mid-sixties. This issues eventually went up to the Secretary of State, Secretary
                    of Defense, and was resolved in a classic fashion. We felt that if we kept one
                    tire on the autobahn itself, we retained our rights. I don't know what the
                    Russians felt about all this, but they were indeed concerned about traffic, it
                    appeared, and never caused us any problems about this. It did seem a bit
                    excessively neuralgic to me. I think I was perhaps unique in that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that people focusing on this really lost
                        sight of the real world in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Precisely. But, you know, there was a sort of myth of Berlin that grew
                    up. And our rights on this autobahn issue as well as every other issue did not
                    rest on international agreements. It just rested on custom and practice which
                    had grown up since 1945. Everybody was afraid to change anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the Soviets on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, I did not personally. I wrote some protests on one or another issue,
                    but we dealt through our military representative in the vast Berlin Air Safety
                    Center where messages were passed back and forth about our incoming and outgoing
                    flights. There was a Lt. Colonel Pothoff who I dealt with almost every day. He
                    had the contact with the Russian authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the military there? I have
                        done interviews with Pete Day...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: He was my boss.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the interview done with him he felt our military was a
                        bit pushy and doing some things that were unnecessary and which caused some
                        problems. How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I wasn't struck by that so much, perhaps because I didn't have the
                    contact. We did have this other mission in Potsdam, which was a purely military
                    mission, and they were there by right of an agreement with the Russians which
                    gave them reciprocal rights in West Germany. That was a game of “catch me if you
                    can” sort of thing. The job of these people was to find out how many Soviet
                    military personnel were at any one point and what they were doing, and the
                    equipment they had. The Russians did the same thing. I think it provided a
                    certain degree of stability, but this derring-do on their part energized
                    everybody. It was great stuff. They had special souped up cars that the Russians
                    couldn't keep up with. A lot of fun.</p>
                <p>It was a very pleasant time in Berlin. Berlin was off the front burner and while
                    this was good for everybody, the Berliners felt neglected by the world and I
                    think really would have preferred to be in the center of world attention, even
                    if it meant privation and hardship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: We figured that Russian tanks, which we could see, of course, from the
                    air, could be in our house in five minutes. I don't think we thought about it a
                    great deal. We had two children there. We occasionally went over to East Berlin
                    which was our right and duty to do. We were always urged to go over there. We
                    were always a little tense leaving two infants back in West Berlin. I never
                    drove as carefully in my life as I did in East Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of East Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was a drab scene. I think the drabness of Berlin...it was the sense of
                    lack of progress. It was as if it had been in a time warp and was still back in
                    the 1920s in a way. That was particularly true on occasions such as New Year's
                    Eve. We would sit home and flick the dial between East and West and the
                    entertainment in the East was strictly 1930, nothing had changed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kurt Weill would have been quite happy there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Very happy. Everybody kind of looked the same. There was sort of one
                    size, one color of raincoat. That sort of thing. But the arts were tremendous in
                    East Berlin. That is where they put a lot of their money. Again there was this
                    competition between East and West which made it very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Berlin after two years and came back to the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. My tour was curtailed. I was asked to come back to the Japan Desk. I
                    was a Japan hand who felt just slightly out of place in Berlin among all these
                    old Berlin hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a Berlin clique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, a German clique. But I was familiar with that. So I was back on the
                    Japan Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from 1967-70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That is correct. I had two jobs. One was the political/military job and
                    the other one was keeping track of internal Japanese political affairs. The last
                    year I was also the deputy director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is the period of our great involvement in
                        Vietnam. How was this being played out from your vantage point as far as
                        with the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: If I could go back to Berlin for just a second. Since I spoke German
                    fluently, I was asked on a couple of occasions to go meet with student groups
                    and other groups and talk about Vietnam. I personally felt somewhat ill at ease
                    because almost from the beginning I was opposed personally to our involvement in
                    Vietnam. I thought it was the wrong war at the wrong time. I recall one
                    individual putting it this way. You are saying that we are really defending
                    Berlin from the Communists in Vietnam, but are you ready to equate Diem and Nhu
                    with our Willy Brandt? Frankly I couldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that I never quite understood and I wonder if
                        you could give me your perspective on this? I am talking about the German
                        students. They seemed to be rather a unique group. They go into a lot of
                        play acting. They seem to take their politics much more intensely, certainly
                        than the Americans but even then most of the other Europeans. They seem to
                        get into these things more. This is just an impression I get but bits of TV
                        and all that. Did you feel that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The politicalization of the Free University in Berlin was just beginning
                    at that time. When we arrived it was relatively minor but I think Vietnam more
                    than anything energized these folks. And Berlin became because of its special
                    status, a refuge for the left, interestingly enough, because citizens of Berlin
                    were exempt from the draft. These people were, of course, very much
                    anti-military, anti-German military as well. By the time I left in 1967 it was
                    beginning to become a hotbed of anti-Vietnam activity. There was also a number
                    of serious demonstrations. We had a young lady in our house who was a student
                    there. She was a member of the SDS which was the student organization.
                    Personally she was a delightful person and took very good care of our kids when
                    we went away and we felt very comfortable with her. Her fianc� was in West
                    Germany somewhere. He was much more active than she was.</p>
                <p>So we had some good talks with them. But again I found them somewhat like the
                    Japanese students that I was very familiar with. They were super idealistic
                    While I didn't subscribe to our Vietnam policy, I thought they were overdoing
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to the Japanese Desk. How were you reading the
                        Vietnam situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Our policy, of course, was to get the Japanese not to go off the
                    reservation. To maintain our bases in Japan and to retain our freedom to use
                    them, which meant, of course, not launching any combat operations from them, but
                    we didn't need to. We had Okinawa to do that if we needed to as well as the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>There was, of course, a growing anti-war movement in Japan and the Japanese were
                    concerned that our engagement in Vietnam would involve them, the Japanese, in
                    conflict with the Chinese. I think many thoughtful Japanese said in effect, “You
                    know your war in Vietnam is just like our war in China. We had all the military
                    victories but we lost the war.” I thought that was not that far off the
                    mark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that being in the East Asian Bureau that it
                        was difficult? Were there sort of true believers at the top and that you had
                        to be concerned about the reporting that was coming out of Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Not particularly. We had so many issues and problems to deal with Japan
                    that were strictly bilateral that did not affect the Vietnam thing one way or
                    the other. There was very little interaction there. We had much more interaction
                    with the Korean Desk, the China Desk. Although I did have some good friends on
                    the Vietnam Desk, some of whom were true believers and with whom I had some good
                    discussions about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that you were seeing that we
                        had with Japan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: One of the issues that arose that first fall was the issue of Okinawa. I
                    think it was very clear to both of us that until there was some further progress
                    on the Vietnam situation that it would be difficult for us to give up our
                    unfettered use of Okinawa.</p>
                <p>Another major issue was the seizing of the Pueblo off the coast of Korea. I
                    happened to be in charge of the Japan Desk at the time because my boss, Dick
                    Sneider, was at a conference. Of course, the Japanese Ambassador came in quite
                    often on consultations on this issue. The Japanese were much concerned that we
                    would launch combat operations from Japanese bases in retaliatory action. That
                    increase of tension on the Korean peninsula, of course, did affect the Japanese
                    government a great deal more than what was going on in Vietnam because Vietnam
                    was further away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling on the Pueblo business? This was when
                        the North Koreans seizing a radio intelligence ship. Did the Japanese just
                        want to stay out of the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. They wanted a peaceful resolution of this issue. They did not, I
                    think, want to be in the position of having to authorize the use of bases in
                    Japan for combat strikes against North Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a question. You know we had our troops in
                        Japan, not major elements, but bases there with the rationale of protecting
                        Japan. Looking at it how did you feel? Were we reaching the point of
                        wondering what we were doing there? Did it make sense to be there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Certainly the Japanese public opinion was strongly against any
                    involvement of Japan in the Korean conflict. Nevertheless, the Japanese
                    government did recognize that in Korea, if nowhere else in the world, it was
                    very much in Japan's national interest. While they certainly didn't think of
                    sending combat forces or anything like that over to Korea...that was the last
                    thing the Koreans would want...I think they were generally understanding that if
                    there had been an invasion of South Korea by the North that of course there may
                    well have arisen opportunities for us to use bases in Japan to protect our
                    interests in South Korea. But I think something like the seizure of a naval
                    vessel didn't qualify for that. We eventually backed off from retaliatory
                    action. The Japanese were understandably nervous. There were a couple of
                    meetings that I recall with the Secretary of State on this issue. The Japanese
                    press was very much interested to know what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>Another major interest was the increasing pressure at that time on the part of
                    the Japanese to reduce our military presence in Japan, to withdraw our bases
                    from downtown Tokyo and other cities. To move out into the countryside. The
                    Japanese were prepared to a large extent to offer alternative facilities. To
                    just consolidate our facilities.By that point the Japanese economy was going
                    great guns and there was growing pressure in Japan for us to return some base
                    land, which they saw as being under-utilized. We did in a somewhat desultory
                    fashion turn back bases and facilities at that time. As a matter of fact I
                    recall one case where the military felt that it would be advisable to give up
                    our big naval base at Yokosuka, which we on the Desk thought was the last place
                    in Japan we should give up. We actually talked the military into keeping it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the military side was it thought that Subic Bay would
                        take care of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was during Lyndon Johnson's presidency and his desire to avoid
                    spending a lot of dollars abroad. It may well be that there was the feeling that
                    Subic would be adequate for our purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the American military? They don't give up
                        facilities easily.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think they will never volunteer to give up anything because they don't
                    pay the price for it. On the other hand, fortunately, I think they are very
                    disciplined and if they get an order from above to get rid of something, they
                    will salute smartly and get rid of it. There were times in our history when
                    budgetary requirements have mandated such elimination of foreign bases.</p>
                <p>A final issue and one which kept me very involved for a long time, was the issue
                    of nuclear powered warships into Japanese ships. There I dealt with Admiral
                    Rickover and his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Rickover was famous as the father of the nuclear
                        navy and a power unto himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes and with direct access to the Congress where he had many friends. The
                    Japanese at that time, again responding, I think, to public pressure, exhibited
                    extreme nervousness about the port entry of nuclear powered warships. The
                    Japanese weren't the only ones at that time that were nervous, but perhaps as
                    much as anybody they were nervous with this rather new technology. It was part
                    of the Japanese nuclear allergy. We assured them that there was nothing to fear,
                    but they had very strong doubts and insisted on their own monitoring. We had
                    very little confidence in their monitoring. There were discrepancies between
                    their monitoring and our monitoring. There were always demonstrations by left
                    wing forces in Japan whenever nuclear powered warships...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were usually submarines weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Submarines at first, but later on there were also surface vessels. It
                    took a lot of patient work. Of course Admiral Rickover really didn't want to
                    make any concessions whatsoever. He was confident that his reactors didn't leak,
                    had never leaked, were never going to leak, and whatever the Japanese saw on
                    their instruments was of no interest to him. Our job was to keep both happy, a
                    typical diplomat's task.</p>
                <p>It took a long time and beyond the time that I was involved with it. The Japanese
                    eventually recognized that these nuclear reactors really were safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with the mega problem of whether our
                        vessels were carrying nuclear weapons or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That involved the highest levels although I did do some writing about it.
                    There were a couple of incidents when this issue came up. It came up
                    periodically in Japan and was always resolved by a complicated terminology on
                    both sides. We would not do anything without the knowledge of the Japanese
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the recognition of China? We were
                        adamant that nobody recognize China and a few years later we surprised
                        everybody by doing it. I think the Japanese wanted to get going with
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, it was one of the most important points of difference between us. I
                    think the Japanese were good, if reluctant, soldiers on this thing and supported
                    our position at the UN even while we were losing worldwide support for our China
                    policy. But again this was a little before the time this China issue became very
                    hot. As long as we were as heavily involved in Vietnam as we were in the late
                    sixties, it didn't seem quite feasible that very much would happen there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the major items you were covering at that

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, I would say so. Oh, one other issue was the reversion of the Bonin
                    Islands to Japan. While a minor matter it was generally seen by both the
                    Japanese and ourselves as the precursor of the reversion of Okinawa which was a
                    bigger issue. It went rather well.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: Yes. And the symbolic significance of Iwo Jima. We were very concerned
                    about our veterans. Actually our veterans were really ahead of the game, I
                    think, and were supportive as long as the memorial on Iwo Jima was taken care
                    of. They had already established sort of collegial ties with veterans
                    associations in Japan and if anything I think they were rather helpful on this
                    matter. It was taken care of by an administrative agreement with the Japanese
                    rather than a treaty, but we, of course, did take great care that the Congress
                    wouldn't give us any problems. We recognized, of course, the political
                    significance of Iwo Jima.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the reversion issue which is a word we never
                        use anymore and was almost strictly used in our political vocabulary to
                        Japan, and mainly Okinawa, but also the Bonin Islands to begin with...the
                        northern islands and the Soviets who struck me as an interested but not
                        involved observer that the Soviets lost a major...they kept Japan
                        permanently hostile practically, even to today, because of these little
                        islands, where some compromise might have been reached. Were we thinking
                        that with the Soviets doing their thing we could show some flexibility and
                        they couldn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think so. It certainly made the Japanese government's task somewhat
                    easier in asking for increased appropriations for military expenditures.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I should also mention that in the time 1967-70, when I was on the Desk, we got
                    real movement. With the onset of the Nixon administration in January, 1969, we
                    got real movement on the reversion of Okinawa because we saw that a satisfactory
                    resolution of the Okinawa issue was prerequisite for our ability to maintain the
                    US-Japan Security Treaty, which underlay the whole relationship.</p>
                <p>My boss at that time, Dick Sneider, who moved over in 1969 to the National
                    Security Council, was highly successful in convincing the powers that be that
                    flexibility was essential. Elements of the military held out until the last
                    moment, but agreement was reached in 1970, or so, for reversion to take place in
                    1972. It was one occasion where the US government moved in the nick of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling sitting on the Desk about the
                        Okinawa business, because if I recall the mayor of Naha kept being thrown in
                        everyone's face because he was supposed to be a Communist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, he was a Communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a slippery slope to ruin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The mayor of Naha, the capital city of Okinawa, was Mr. Sanaga. Sanaga
                    had been elected mayor of Naha and then the military had purged him from office
                    under their powers there. This didn't necessarily endear him and other people to
                    continued American rule. It was an expression not of their Communism, but
                    Okinawans tend to be somewhat ornery against someone who is trying to run their
                    affairs for them. I thought we had no good reason, frankly, to maintain rule
                    over a million Okinawans. They needed to go back to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? Was Okinawa considered part of
                        Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any separatist movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, there was a very, very minor separatist movement and I suppose the
                    Okinawans if they had their druthers in a perfect world would prefer to be
                    independent. But they realized that they can't go it alone. To be a part of a
                    rapidly more wealthy Japan wasn't half bad, and that, of course, is what it
                    proved to be. So it was a very good move.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In the reversion negotiations I think we retained all the essential rights. One
                    wonders now what all the fuss was about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the key people in this whole reversion thing as
                        you saw if, from our side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think Dick Sneider orchestrated the whole thing and later became the
                    negotiator for the reversion in Tokyo. I think Alex Johnson played a major role.
                    There was a fellow, a political appointee, over in Defense, ISA. He later was
                    involved with the Pentagon Papers and is head of the ACLU now. I can't remember
                    his name. At the time he was a rather young man, I think around 30, although he
                    was a deputy assistant secretary. He helped swing part of the military around,
                    although the military were never very enthusiastic about this. Until the very
                    end, I think, the CINCPAC Commander, Admiral Sharp, opposed it. But the civilian
                    authorities in Defense gradually swung over to the view that it wouldn't be the
                    end of the world. We were also concerned, of course, of what Congress would say.
                    In the end the Congress was much more sympathetic than we had thought. We were
                    concerned about some of the economic arrangements involved in the reversion, but
                    Congress seemed to be rather disinterested about the American business community
                    and their rights.</p>
                <p>Then, in the negotiations we got some good words from the GOJ on the use of
                    Japanese bases in the future, particularly in the event of a Korean eventuality,
                    and to a lesser extent, in the case of a Taiwan eventuality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the terminology, an eventuality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I think the word was contingency. It has been a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you made quite a change of pace and moved over to
                        Arms Control from 1970-73. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: For personal reasons we wanted to remain in Washington at that time. A
                    job came open and I moved over there and worked for Jim Leonard and Pete Day
                    most of the time. It was a very different kind of a place, but I must say I
                    enjoyed it. It was the heyday really of ACDA. It was the time of SALT I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And ACDA is Arms Control Disarmament Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: There was a section within ACDA which was called IR, International
                    Relations, and that was staffed by FSOs. I had nothing to do with the SALT part.
                    My interest was with CCD, Conference of the Committee of Disarmament, in Geneva
                    at that time. We were, of course, a member of that. It was not the bilateral but
                    the multilateral arms control negotiating instrument. There were a number of
                    agreements that had just then been reached, notably the Nuclear Nonproliferation
                    Treaty. There were other agreements. There was the Biological Treaty, the
                    Seabeds Treaty and other arms control ventures were talked about like a chemical
                    treaty which is now getting on the boards. It was an interesting time.</p>
                <p>I never went to Geneva. All my work was back here which meant negotiating with
                    other agencies of the government. A particular interest of mine at that time was
                    to do a comprehensive test ban treaty, or CTBT as it was known. It was a step
                    forward from the limited test ban treaty of the Kennedy administration. There
                    were endless negotiations on this issue, primarily with the AEC, Atomic Energy
                    Commission, which was the major player and the Pentagon, which was also a major
                    player but didn't feel quite as threatened by that as the AEC did. And, of
                    course, the State Department was another separate entity. So it was generally a
                    four power group, sometime with the participation of the National Security
                    Council. I learned that on a number of these issues it was hard to get anything
                    in the government that was as heatedly debated as these arms control things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Concerning these test ban limitations, this seems to be
                        something that has become just an article of faith. What is it, is it
                        jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, its jobs. The ACE at that time maintained these nuclear
                    laboratories, world renown. They wanted to test in order to try out new theories
                    to get smaller and smaller weapons, or to get larger and larger weapons. To get
                    more reliable weapons. They always maintained that once we abolished these
                    laboratories...if you didn't have testing they said the good people would all
                    leave because they had to verify their theories. Once you dissolved the
                    laboratories, then in our society, unlike totalitarian societies, you could
                    never get these people together again if an emergency arose and you had to start
                    testing again. So there were these endless arguments back and forth.</p>
                <p>We also became quite expert on the whole question of detection of clandestine
                    tests, which was a great concern because the Russians would cheat. And there
                    was, of course, tremendous advances in that area, in seismology, that could
                    differentiate between a nuclear test and an earthquake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you counter the AEC arguments on testing and how
                        were they resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Let me go to the second part first, how were they resolved. Essentially
                    they were never resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still aren't today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: They were not resolved because in the last analysis Henry Kissinger
                    didn't want to resolve them. He didn't want, I think, to muddy the water. His
                    focus was on SALT I and he felt that he had a difficult enough time with all the
                    other players involved just to get SALT I through the Senate and approved by the
                    American public. He didn't want any other issue along those lines to muddy the
                    waters. I think there was a feeling that in due course maybe some of these
                    issues would be seriously dealt with. But I think he probably felt that
                    politically it was a good thing to keep these bureaucrats working on these
                    issues. He could always show his interest in this type of arms control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was getting some of the same picture from interviews I
                        did including George Vest on the CSCE—Council for Security and Cooperation
                        in Europe. Kissinger was basically undercutting this too, because he didn't
                        want to solve this because it was detracting from SALT I.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That was certainly our impression. Of course, there was a certain amount
                    of international pressure to get moving on some of these issues. The strongest
                    argument we had for the CTBT was as a nonproliferation instrument...we saw
                    countries like India and Pakistan and others as possibly getting into the
                    nuclear game, but they wouldn't be able to do so if they were required to sign
                    on to a test ban treaty. And I think even today it is still seen, at least
                    potentially, as a very useful nonproliferation measure and eventually we may see
                    that.</p>
                <p>We were also trying at that time to...well working with State getting new
                    countries, any country, signed on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. I
                    think we were hopeful at that time that this nuclear nonproliferation regime
                    would last, and I think would have been perhaps surprised to see in 1992 how
                    well it has lasted, with some defections, obviously.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think we probably had our suspicions that they had nuclear capability,
                    but we weren't going to do a great deal about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: And given the situation in the Middle East at that time and our
                    disinclination to come to Israel's aid ourselves for whatever might happen
                    there. I think there was some sympathy for the Israeli position.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: India, Pakistan were perhaps the most neuralgic point in terms of new
                    nuclear powers and given their relationship, we could have that as a potential
                    nuclear conflict. But there were other countries where we had hoped, and to this
                    day haven't succeeded...Brazil and Argentina have never signed on. Of course,
                    German and Japanese participation was of great importance to us. South Korean
                    participation, and eventually North Korean, was important to us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That came out of the blue. I didn't ask for that job, but I was assigned
                    to the NATO Defense College in Rome in 1973. A half year in Rome sounded just
                    too good to turn down. After I secured an ongoing assignment, which I felt was
                    essential, I consented to go. It was, to put it mildly, a very relaxed time of
                    my life. We thoroughly enjoyed living in Italy, saw a great deal of the country.
                    It was kind of disastrous in terms of the education of our kids...for a half
                    year go off to somewhere where they didn't know anybody and leave again. But my
                    wife and I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I learned a little bit about NATO. We had some great trips. Drank
                    an awful lot of Zambucca to cement NATO ties. Made some friends, although I
                    really haven't kept up with any of them. Then I went, of course, to perhaps the
                    only non-NATO country in the Western Europe, Switzerland. I guess it had some
                    utility. Of course one never knows.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: I had two jobs. I was the political counselor, but shortly after I got
                    there my one assistant was cut and not replaced, which was totally legitimate.
                    My other job was as the PAO, Public Affairs Officer. The United States and
                    Switzerland really have no political problems. Switzerland, of course, was then
                    not, and still is not, a member of the United Nations.</p>

                    organizations, which occasionally become the focus for little countries. Also
                    the relationship with Cuba was handled out of Washington and not Bern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were handling our interests there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yeah. So, I think the interest in Swiss domestic affairs in Washington
                    was minimal, to put it mildly. Therefore, I found my interest really turned
                    rapidly to all the public affairs work. And I thoroughly enjoyed that.
                    Switzerland being the country it is with really four national languages has a
                    number of interesting newspapers. The most important of course if the German
                    Neue Zuercher Zeitung, which many regard as probably the best German language
                    newspaper in the world. There is a German paper the Frankfurter Zeitung which is
                    a rival, perhaps. But at that time it certainly was an influential paper.</p>
                <p>I also thought that it could have been of some interest to have good ties with
                    their Italian broadcasting companies, not knowing at that time where Italy was
                    going. Their French press was perhaps not as influential as their German press,
                    but nevertheless...</p>
                <p>So I kept in touch with the media in particular and had some interesting
                    connections with intellectuals in Switzerland. And the Swiss, if anything, are
                    very well informed. I think I valued some of my ties with the Swiss foreign
                    office. They have first rate diplomats and have, despite their neutrality, an
                    immense interest in military affairs. Of course, all the Swiss males have a
                    military obligation well into their middle age and had a keen interest in NATO
                    affairs. In some ways you might have said they were better NATO allies then some
                    of our NATO allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thinks of Switzerland of being the center of the
                        spying trade. Did this intrude at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, it is done elsewhere. I think that is a legacy of World War II and I
                    am not sure there is any more of it there than anywhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two ambassador, Peter Dominic and Nathaniel
                        Davis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STRAUS: We had three ambassadors. We had Shelby Cullom Davis, the first
                    Ambassador and a Nixon appointee. A strange man. I don't think he was ever
                    interested in anything that either came in or left that Embassy. His main
                    interest was holding parties. He was very good at that. Although he didn't
                    connect it with any US policy issue ever. He was a nice enough man personally.
                    It didn't really bother us because he didn't feel he should run the Embassy. His
                    interests were elsewhere. He was an extremely wealthy man. Then when Nixon
                    summarily left office, President Ford picked up Ambassador Davis' resignation,
                    which surprised him, I think, since he had been a major contributor to the
                    party. I remember he was very reluctant to leave.</p>
                <p>Then Peter Dominic came in. That was a very unfortunate appointment. Dominic was,
                    I guess, a friend of President Ford's. Dominic was at that time inflicted with a
                    rare illness and I think he wanted to come to Switzerland to seek a cure for
                    this illness against the advice of his family. He was a sick man when he
                    arrived. He took some medication, the effects of which caused some people to
                    believe, who didn't know the circumstances, that he was drunk. Well, he should
                    never have come. He left after less then a year and died not long
                    thereafter.</p>
                <p>Then Nat Davis came. I think he was under a cloud at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of Chile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, he had also been Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and had
                    gotten into a fight with Kissinger. Kissinger wanted to get rid of him.
                    Switzerland came open and he went. Well, there wasn't very much for him to do in
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a big gun in the Foreign Service as far as being a
                        very active ambassador. To all of a sudden dump him in Switzerland...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The major thing that happened to him, and I happened to be along in my
                    capacity as PAO, was when we marched down to Lausanne to give a medal by the
                    American Academy to Charlie Chaplin, who was then within a year of his
                    death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am surprised Charlie Chaplin got involved because he had
                        essentially been persona non grata.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, this was essentially the American Academy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But presented by the American Ambassador. Was that a
                        matter of any debate within the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Not that I recall. The Ambassador was asked to do it, I think, and he was
                    very happy to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a high point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, to see Charlie Chaplin once was really something. Chaplin was very
                    gracious. I think he knew what was going on, but that was about all. He was a
                    very ill man then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this very challenging assignment you came back to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I came back to Washington without an assignment and it was a very rough
                    period of time for me, personally. At one point I was supposed to go to an
                    Africa DCMship and that fell through. The person who got the job was fired after
                    about six months, which I thought was only fair. I walked the halls for a while.
                    That was very rough because with children of school age you wanted to know where
                    you were going to be settled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having been there myself you begin to wonder what you have
                        done wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: It was very unpleasant. But eventually I landed a job in the African
                    Bureau as Deputy Director of the Office of Inter-African Affairs. Essentially
                    this meant that you did whatever the Desks didn't want to do or get involved
                    with. So it was a variety of things. Mostly it seemed to be involving the Horn
                    of Africa—Ethiopia and Somalia. They were having a conflict at that time that
                    involved refugee issues, arms to Chad...in order to justify arms to Chad we had
                    to justify that Chad was a vital national interest to the United States.
                    Everything was seen in terms of the East-West conflict of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Ethiopia in those days? Was Somalia our great
                        ally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No. We had made the switch, or the Russians had made it for us. They had
                    captured the Ethiopians which irked the Somalis to no end, so we got the
                    Somalis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was one of two or three switches we went through in
                        that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The job was okay. Again I had not dealt with African affairs in the
                    past.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, it was kind of a mess. We had Dick Moose as Assistant Secretary at
                    the time. He was a very political animal. My boss, who was not a regular Foreign
                    Service officer got into a fight with Dick Moose and that wasn't always easy. I
                    thought the personnel was somewhat more spotty. There were some very good people
                    in it, obviously. But more spotty then I was used to in the European and East
                    Asian Bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a stepchild, but it had its moments. I think you
                        caught it at one of the times when it was sort of political but also very
                        much on the back burner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Very much on the back burner.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I didn't get involved with it. This was during the time of the Carter
                    administration...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Human rights. There were some outstanding people on the South African
                    Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Inter-African Affairs did that figure much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, it dealt with arms. I am afraid we were busy peddling arms to the
                    Africans. Of course, they wanted the stuff. It wasn't that we were pushing it on
                    them. But the Africans felt that it was part of their expression of sovereignty.
                    It wasn't that these countries were getting very sophisticated things or a lot
                    of it, but nevertheless we were providing arms to countries that had next to
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel at that time about the “Soviet threat” in
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I think it was rather reactive. We did see certain areas as more
                    strategic then others, clearly. The Horn of Africa was perhaps the most
                    strategic area in that it commanded part of the Red Sea portion of the Suez
                    Canal in which we had a strategic interest, and it was close to the Saudi
                    Arabian oil fields as well. Another area was South Africa. The South Africans
                    never lost an opportunity to tell us how important it was. I was somewhat more
                    skeptical of those assertions. This was also the time, I believe, of the first
                    hesitant steps towards independence of Angola and Mozambique and there was
                    warfare raging in those two areas. Not regarded, I think, as a major strategic
                    threat to us. We were concerned wherever...there was Guinea which was a place
                    where Russian planes could refuel at least in hops to Havana. I think we were
                    nervous about any staging areas, any bases that the Soviets could manage in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any impression of African governments? Did
                        you have any dealings with any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, although after I had been in the Bureau for about a year, they kindly
                    decided that I should go to Africa and I got a trip there, which was a bit of a
                    boondoggle, but I learned quite a bit. I decided to go to southern and eastern
                    Africa, largely because I had a whole bunch of friends in the area. I say
                    southern advisedly, because I went to Johannesburg only to go to other areas. I
                    didn't go to South Africa, itself. But even my stopover in Johannesburg turned
                    out to be interesting. I was able to go to a meeting of some black leaders and
                    members of the Consulate staff at a white restaurant. That was an interesting
                    experience. I also went to Botswana and Mozambique and then moved up to Lusaka
                    and to Kenya. I was then going to go to Ethiopia, but at that point there were
                    mass executions in the center of Addis. They were throwing out members of our
                    Embassy. It was just the wrong time to go there. I wanted then to go to Somalia
                    instead but East African Airlines was breaking up so I couldn't go there. Since
                    I still had a few days left on the trip I went to Sudan, which I thought was the
                    very end of the world. I never felt so totally alien as I felt there. I did get
                    at least a flavor for East Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after that you went where?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>STRAUS: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The position was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: As Consul General. This was six years after reversion and Okinawa by that
                    time was a regular part of Japan. The thing that makes Okinawa unusual and why
                    we have a consulate there in the first place is the fact that we have somewhere
                    between two-thirds and three-quarters of our total military forces in Japan on
                    Okinawa. The time that I was there that meant about 50,000 Americans, including
                    dependents, which translates to five percent of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is not a heavily populated island then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, a million people. Part of the area is jungle. Of course, the
                    potential of problems are manifold. On my way to Japan I stopped off in Tokyo
                    and had a memorable first encounter with Ambassador Mansfield. He was so
                    gracious. He asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee, and I said, “yes.” He goes
                    out into the little vestibule next to his office and makes the coffee. I also,
                    of course, talked to Bill Sherman, an old friend, who was DCM at the time. Bill
                    in effect told me to do my thing down there. He didn't want to hear from me. We
                    don't want any of the problems in Okinawa to escalate into US-Japan issues. And
                    I think I was successful to the extent that during my time there I think I
                    succeeded in doing that.</p>
                <p>I think that having good luck is an essential part of effective diplomacy. And I
                    was very fortunate. I was fortunate in the type of military officers I dealt
                    with for the most part on Okinawa. I was also most fortunate in the Okinawan
                    authorities that I dealt with. Within a couple of weeks of my arrival in
                    Okinawa, the Governor of Okinawa, who was a member of the left, was stricken by
                    a stroke, which forced him out of office within two or three months, and led to
                    his untimely death. He was succeeded by the candidate of the Liberal Democratic
                    Party, the center right in Japan, and he took a much more cooperative view of
                    the American military presence in Japan then his predecessor had. It was a
                    period of conservative resurgence. It was believed by the Okinawans that it was
                    the left wing that had set the stage and effected the reversion of Okinawa. But
                    now that they were part of Japan, it was more beneficial to have a member of the
                    same party that was running the rest of Japan as governor. But it wasn't just
                    the governor, it was a lot of other local jobs that went to the conservative
                    party.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>As I said, I found the military, particularly some of the Marines...in Okinawa it
                    should be noted that there was a rather unusual situation. It is the only place
                    abroad where it is the Marines that are the dominant military force. So the
                    senior military commander was a Marine. You have about seven or eight general
                    Marine officers. The next largest force is the Air Force, because of the huge
                    Kadena Airfield there. Then the Army and Naval are minuscule, which is rather
                    strange.</p>
                <p>I guess my job was really to keep the peace. I had generally pretty good
                    cooperation from the military. I never had to go up to Tokyo to ask them for
                    anything. I had very good relations with the Japanese government authorities, as
                    well as with the Okinawa authorities. We got constant harping in the Okinawan
                    press, which plays a major role in Okinawa. We had frequent protest groups that
                    came to the Consulate. We encouraged them to come to us rather than to the
                    military because we felt we could probably deal with them better than the
                    military could. We were fortunate that there were no really major incidents. I'm
                    glad to say that during my time there was no murder on the part of our troops.
                    All the really nasty stuff the military do in Japan really goes on in Okinawa.
                    The nasty stuff involves live fire exercises which the Marines have to do to
                    practice. Your typical Marine is a 19-year-old. The Air Force is very different.
                    It is generally a 35 year old married mechanic who is the typical Air Force guy.
                    If anybody is going to get in trouble off base it is generally a Marine. But
                    most of the problems were not that type. There were ricocheting bullets, which
                    hit a rock and would fly out of the maneuver area. Then there were accidents
                    involving the Air Force like fuel spills and that sort of thing. Then the Air
                    Force also, of course, were very noisy. They had these U2 type aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were high flying photograph type planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes, remarkable things. They had the most modern fighter jets at Kadena
                    Airfield, one of the largest military bases in the world. Active 24 hours around
                    the clock.</p>
                <p>I used to tell the Marines and Air Force when they would complain about lack of
                    Japanese cooperation, “What do you think an American mayor or governor would do
                    in similar circumstances?” They were generally understanding. Particularly the
                    Marines. Perhaps they lived close to the ground and had a particular
                    understanding for the political problems. I also had that feeling with the Army,
                    a much smaller group.</p>
                <p>So it was a very interesting experience for me. There was nothing like running
                    your own post. I did a lot of reporting on incidents and I think the way I
                    reported them had an effect on perhaps decreasing the number of these incidents,
                    making sure the military took all reasonable precautions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, no. As I said, I found them generally quite accommodating and it was
                    always a matter of individuals. You can't expect all of them to be that way. I
                    think if they felt that you understood their problem ...When I got there in
                    1978, their problem in part was that the average Marine was a guy who was
                    perhaps out of reform school who decided it would be better to go into the
                    Marines then anywhere else at this point in his life. Many of them didn't have a
                    high school diploma. By the time I left in 1982, that had changed. The quality
                    of the people they were getting was much better. But we were still in the
                    post-Vietnam period when I arrived. I had sympathy for them and I expressed
                    that. I thought they were doing a remarkable job really of educating these young
                    men and women.</p>
                <p>I counted this as some of the happiest time I spent. I wasn't overworked, but on
                    the other hand I had plenty to do and I thought I was very usefully
                    employed.</p>

                        of use you to find out what was happening on the mainland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No not that, but I had the feeling that there were three actors, three
                    players in Okinawa, whereas in Japan you only had two. You had the Okinawans who
                    were sort of the landlords, the Japanese who were the treasurers, and then there
                    was us. And any two were sort of playing off against the third and often
                    badmouthing the third. But I think it was a well-understood game. And, as I
                    said, largely thanks to the kindness and understanding of the Governor, who I
                    thought was a very shrewd and effective politician and was there almost the
                    entire time I was there, things suddenly worked a lot better in Okinawa and I
                    was able to take the credit for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about the Japanese officials or
                        others who were down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, I think the Japanese were usually more sensitive to the situation
                    in Okinawa than they are usually given credit for. The Okinawans, while they
                    were under the Americans had a great deal of independence, and now they were
                    just another prefecture. Not only that, they were a prefecture that was
                    historically the poorest of the lot. In a sense they didn't like that. They
                    liked to be more important. So they screamed and did a lot of yelling which
                    resulted in the Japanese pouring a lot of money down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>There were a lot of guilt feelings involved on the part of the Japanese because,
                    of course, the only land battles fought on Japanese soil was in Okinawa. They
                    were told that was necessary in order to defend the homeland. Well, it turned
                    out the homeland then decided to throw in the sponge. The whole thing is, of
                    course, an irony. Everybody, of course, knows about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but
                    the prefecture that took the heaviest hits in World War II, was none of those
                    two, it was Okinawa. A quarter of the population of the prefecture died. No
                    place in the world had that kind of catastrophe. It was staggering. Historically
                    they had been very pacifist. Then the irony is that they now host the largest
                    concentration of American forces in Japan. So the Okinawan feeling is that you
                    Japanese are getting the benefits of the American presence, but we have the
                    Americans, thank you very much! So the Japanese say, “Yeah, but look what we are
                    doing. We are subsidizing this and that.” And they are doing that. And they were
                    careful, at least during the period I was there, to restrain their business and
                    not rush pell-mell down there and drive out less efficient Okinawan businesses.
                    So there were no Japanese banks down there or department stores or construction
                    companies. Okinawa really has no industry as such. Whether this has changed in
                    the meantime, I don't know. But at that time I thought they showed commendable
                    restraint and sensitivity. At the same time that they still tended to look down
                    on the Okinawans as being under-educated, under-disciplined. Okinawans tend to
                    be sort of southern people...a little slow, more relaxed...and that is not the
                    Japanese. There is a difference.</p>
                <p>But we appreciated the Okinawan culture. It is a different culture and it is
                    remarkable what that little group of islands accomplished in history.</p>

                <p>STRAUS: I got the job on the Philippine Desk, I think largely because it was
                    thought that I had taken good care of our military relationship in Okinawa. Of
                    course, I hadn't known anything about the Philippines, but even before I left I
                    did go down the Philippines...Okinawa and the Philippines are very close.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Right. The situation in the Philippines was a mess. I inherited a mess.
                    It was a mess in the sense that the security situation was bad and getting
                    worse. The NPA, the New Peoples Army, was getting stronger as the government of
                    Marcos was becoming more ruthless. There were some assassinations that were
                    rather gross, human rights violations, the economy was in a tailspin. So things
                    were not happy there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took over the Desk. Again you were the new boy.
                        What was our attitude at that time towards the Marcos regime that you were
                        getting from the people you were talking to in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I think the general attitude was that we weren't very happy with Marcos,
                    we saw a lot of the things he was doing wrong, but we could play ball with him
                    and there didn't seem to be anybody who could topple him from power. There
                    didn't seem to be any organization in the Philippines capable of doing that.
                    This was certainly the feeling among many Filipinos as well. I had the feeling,
                    particularly as we got into 1983, that if reforms were going to be made it was
                    going to have to be Marcos who made them. And this was said by some members of
                    the opposition as well. That was one thing.</p>
                <p>I remember talking to Raul Manglapus, who was the Foreign Minister for Mrs.
                    Aquino later on but at that time was in exile in Washington, and his line was
                    essentially this. He said, “Rick, you Americans brought us democracy. Marcos has
                    taken it away from us. It is your responsibility to restore it.” It is very
                    typically Filipino to say that and to mean that. My efforts to disabuse him of
                    this and say, particularly after the Aquino assassination, “If you Filipinos
                    took the initiative then I think American sympathy and support would not be
                    lacking.” But that was not really the Filipino way. It was on my watch that
                    Aquino was assassination and that came as a real shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody knew about his going back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: He talked to us. My deputy, John Maisto, knew a great deal about the
                    Philippines. He had served four years at the Embassy there and was the fellow
                    most knowledgeable about domestic affairs in the Philippines. He had known the
                    Aquinos. He had known Mrs. Aquino. So they had talked to him from Boston and he
                    indicated that he wanted to go back. I think he probably wanted to go back
                    because he had heard that Marcos was ill and perhaps more ill then he had been
                    before and he wanted to be there when he died. He wanted our advice as to what
                    might happen to him. We shared, I guess the advice of most people, including
                    many Filipinos, that most likely he would be incarcerated again. And he was
                    willing to take that chance. It really didn't occur to us...</p>

                <p>STRAUS: No. And I maintain to this day without any proof whatsoever, that if

                        you have the feeling that Reagan was a creature of the American right and
                        the Marcoses had spent a lot of time and effort in cultivating this group.
                        Did you have a feeling that one had to be a bit careful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Let me say this. I think the first year of my work on the Desk was
                    concerned with the renegotiation of the base agreement which was due every five
                    years. The previous negotiation had been extraordinarily difficult and the
                    Filipinos had asked for all kinds of things that we were unwilling to provide
                    them. In this case, the Filipinos proved relatively accommodating, although
                    there was a certain amount of quibbling over the price of what we would pay for
                    the use of the bases. So the negotiations, partly because I think we worked
                    reasonably well with the Defense Department, and partly because the negotiations
                    in the Philippines, were conducted very well. It was a very smooth
                    operation.</p>
                <p>Marcos had ironclad control, I think, on their side. He wanted, I think, to
                    retain Reagan's goodwill and they were concluded in less time then anyone would
                    have thought possible. Everybody felt very good about it.</p>
                <p>Then the next thing that happened was the state visit of Marcos. Now Marcos had
                    been denied a state visit for quite a while, ever since he had declared martial
                    law. He had lifted martial law but this was under the Carter administration, and
                    they felt there were still things Marcos should be doing. But Reagan said
                    yes...this was before my coming on board. The Reagans did this sort of thing
                    with a good deal of grace and charm. Mrs. Marcos really put on the charm. I
                    couldn't stand her, she was a terrible woman. This was the time when we were at
                    the White House and everything was going smoothly. It was a beautiful evening in
                    the spring and we were out in the garden...everything was lovely.</p>
                <p>Then came the assassination. In fact, on the Desk, having polished off the Marcos
                    state visit, which both the White House and Marcos were very happy over, and
                    having polished off the negotiations for the base agreement in a way that people
                    were quite happy about...because these base agreements always have an effect on
                    other base agreements around the world, so we had to keep that in mind. We kind
                    of looked at each other and said, “What's left to do?”</p>
                <p>Marcos had staged this phony election, but he was going to be in power for quite
                    a long time. There was no real hope on the part of anybody that he could be
                    derailed.</p>
                <p>And then everything started changing with the assassination. There was the
                    beginning of some real pressures within the Philippine society. Although, as I
                    said, they really felt that Marcos, who came in as you recall as a reformer and
                    had a sort of Kennedyesque image not only in the Philippines, was the only guy
                    to get them out of their troubles. We did all kinds of contingency papers.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>After the Aquino assassination we started distancing ourselves from the
                    administration of Marcos. We wrote some fairly tough human rights reports quite
                    critical of the Marcos government. But at the same time he was the guy in power
                    and there didn't seem to be any alternative.</p>

                    then run by Mike Armacost, who I must say...some of his cables were models,
                    brilliant. Mike Armacost knows, as probably nobody else that I have encountered
                    in the Foreign Service, how to write from the field a cable that is action
                    oriented and suggests to the bureaucracy where we might do so. So, it was a
                    moderate effort to move Marcos to better human rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling under pressure, that public opinion, TV,
                        the newspapers, and all were pushing you into a position where we didn't
                        know where we were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: We knew where we were going, it was very clear. We also had pressure from
                    the media. We had pressure from elements in the Congress...Steve Solarz and his
                    staff...and we kept them very closely informed in what we were doing and
                    thinking. We actually worked very closely with Solarz and people in the
                    Congress. We had to because Marcos always thought he really knew American
                    politics and that he could play off his friend, Reagan, against the others. Of
                    course Reagan was way up there somewhere and didn't concern himself with the
                    minutiae of Philippine politics. I think, by and large, we avoided Marcos'
                    maneuverings and his terrible brother-in-law ambassador here, Imelda's brother,
                    a rather slimy individual, if I may use that delicate expression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Congressmen or Senators who were sort of in
                        the Marcos pocket by having been lavishly entertained and all that? Was this
                        a problem? This happened with us I know in dealing with the Dominican
                        Republic under Trujillo for a long time when there were members of the
                        Senate and the House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: The Philippines retained in the hearts of many Americans an unusual
                    sympathy. I remember going to a farewell for Romulo, the grand old man at the
                    UN. There was a gala dinner at one of the hotels and there were an awful lot of
                    people who had a very warm regard for the Philippines because, I guess, of the
                    historical relationship with us. It was a kind of paternalistic one. One that
                    the Filipinos in a way invited. Yes, I think there were people, who were not in
                    the pocket that I was aware of, who were very sympathetic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you read Mrs. Marcos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I guess we will have to have another session, but let me just say a few
                    words about the Mrs. She was an ignorant operator. She thought she knew things
                    about international relations. She saw herself as a super diplomat. She saw
                    herself as knowing a good deal about economic affairs too. She was shameless in
                    her pursuit of money and power. She was a great flatterer, even somebody as
                    lowly as a country director. I took an almost instantaneous dislike to her,
                    which, I guess I haven't lost. Whereas I wouldn't say that about him. He was a
                    man of some substance who I think went wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we start the next time we will talk about the events
                        in the Philippines as they reflected on you after the Aquino assassination
                        and how the situation developed at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is February 11, 1993. I remember I was with the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service Liaison Office at the time when they were talking about
                    Aquino going back and what would happen. Did we have any role in his going back
                    or trying to stop him?</p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, we certainly didn't. We shared the conventional wisdom which was very
                    widespread at the time that President Marcos would almost certainly allow Aquino
                    to roam free. That he would be taken into custody and would be given some form
                    of incarceration. Whether that meant prison or house arrest was uncertain. I
                    think this is also what Aquino thought was going to happen. Before he left he
                    called a lot of people to get their advice as to whether he should go back or
                    not. I think he was certainly troubled as to whether he should go back or not.
                    He called my deputy, John Maisto, whom he had known in the Philippines. As I
                    recall John told him just about what I told you. He would probably find himself
                    in custody.</p>
                <p>I remain convinced that one of the reasons for the timing of his return was the
                    fact that Marcos had one of his periodic bouts with the medical folks, he had a
                    bad kidney, and was once in a while put on dialysis. Apparently at that
                    particular time that was one of the worst times for Marcos, medically speaking.
                    There was even some talk in the Philippines that he might be near death. I think
                    Aquino was certainly an ambitious politician and wanted to be inside the
                    country, not in exile, when that happened. I don't think he, or anybody else,
                    thought that he was going to be executed the way things happened. I also remain
                    convinced, although I have absolutely no proof, that this would not have
                    happened if Marcos hadn't been in bad shape physically and therefore not in full
                    control of the government.</p>
                <p>I was scheduled to go on leave at that time in the middle of the summer, and
                    having completed a successful base negotiations and a state visit by Marcos, we
                    felt there wasn't all that much to do. Certainly there was no better time to
                    take leave.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back again, later when things really got bad in the
                        Philippines and the Marcos regime was on the verge, much was made of the
                        special relationship between the Marcoses and the Reagans. Did you get a
                        feel for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, if there was such a thing that was way about my grade level, I guess.
                    I thought that the state visit was very graciously handled by the President and
                    Mrs. Reagan. It was Marcos' first state visit and sort of an award for giving up
                    martial law and having a good base relationship. I didn't get the impression
                    that the President involved himself all that much in the conduct of our
                    relations with the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Marcoses were pulling at everything they
                        possibly could.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you on leave when the assassination happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel when you got back about how the
                        reaction was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. I think the effect was rather strong and a real shock because we
                    were, I think, fairly sure that this kind of a thing would not have happened
                    without somebody who was fairly high up having orchestrated it. We thought the
                    Philippines, who were already in some trouble politically and certainly
                    economically, would have some additional problems. And sure enough there was
                    this massive outpouring for Aquino after his death. In fact it was far greater
                    at that time than when he was alive. The whole thing was so dramatic and
                    appealed to the Filipinos. Although there were a lot of dirty tricks that had
                    gone on prior to the assassination, there was a very clear sense, I think, to
                    the Filipino people that this had gone too far. That was easy to pick up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Embassy as the situation
                        unraveled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That despite everything Marcos was very much still in control. And that
                    the opposition who obviously sought to capitalize on this event was still weak
                    and very much divided and not all that effective. I got the sense in my travel
                    over there, as well as from some of the reporting, that even people in the
                    opposition felt that real reform in the Philippines could come only with the
                    cooperation and under the leadership of Marcos. That was kind of the weird thing
                    that was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any leaders in the opposition that were sort of
                        bandied about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, sure. One was Raul Manglapus, for example, who was in exile in the US
                    and whom I used to see. Later he became the Foreign Minister for Mrs. Aquino. I
                    guess that what I recall most about Manglapus, when I met him on one or two
                    occasions and discussed changes in the Philippines, was that he was want to say,
                    “Rick, the United States brought democracy to the Philippines. Marcos has taken
                    it away. Consequently it is your responsibility to restore it.” I tried to
                    disabuse him of that and said, “If the Philippine people would take some
                    required action to move towards democracy, he would find the United States in
                    support of that.”</p>
                <p>But there was, to my taste any way, too much of an overwhelming feeling in the
                    Philippines that nothing happened there without the United States having willed
                    it. Not a leaf fell from a tree without usually the CIA having orchestrated
                    that. I found that rather discouraging. I thought it required a fundamental
                    change in our relationship to bring that about, although I didn't see how that
                    was going to happen anytime soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did poor Coraz�n Aquino raise any blips on your radar at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: No, she did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just the grieving widow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. And in the beginning that certainly was what she was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about how events develops, particularly as you
                        saw them from the Desk, and how you felt the Embassy was responding to these
                        events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Yes. Well, it was clear both politically and economically that the
                    Philippines were in a growing malaise. The one, of course, was feeding on the
                    other. The Philippines, say in the 1960s, in most respects was the leading
                    country in Southeast Asia, and had become by the middle 1980s probably at the
                    bottom of the heap. And that had been through an accumulation of Marcos
                    policies. There was widespread corruption. This is all quite aside from the
                    assassination, which just added another dimension to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>So, how to get out of this mess? There were all kinds of scenarios that were
                    being written back here to which the Embassy contributed. Mike Armacost was the
                    ambassador at the time and I don't think I have ever seen an ambassador write
                    messages which were as adept in understanding how to get from point A to point B
                    in the bureaucracy. Absolutely superb. Extremely intelligent, goal oriented. He
                    had some excellent meetings with Marcos where he tried to move Marcos to a
                    better position on human rights, which, of course, was a great concern of ours.
                    But it wasn't easy because Marcos' main goal by that point was to remain in
                    power at all cost. And he still had most of the levers of power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling greater heat after the Aquino
                        assassination from Congress and the media?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, yes. I think there ensued after that what I thought was rather a
                    remarkable coincidence really, or unity, of both Democrats and Republicans, of
                    the bureaucracy and Congress, of State and Defense. There were hardly any
                    serious arguments with the view that we really should try to move Marcos into a
                    more politically acceptable position...acceptable both here in the US as well as
                    in the Philippines. We spent a good deal of time, particularly with Solarz who
                    chaired the Asian subcommittee in the House and took the greatest interest in
                    this matter...Solarz, himself, had spent a good deal of time in the Philippines
                    and was personally acquainted with Aquino, so was personally affected by his
                    loss. I thought that there wasn't any real gap between us, which was important
                    because, of course, the Marcos forces were attempting to exploit any gaps in the
                    American front at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel from the White House on

                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Not particularly. I do recall that the NSC staff was represented at these
                    strategy sessions that we had periodically. They were also brought in on
                    testimony that we were required to give from time to time on the Hill. We were
                    all in accord really. But it was difficult to know what to do. There were so
                    many scenarios that were written, but not one, of course, anticipated what would
                    happen.</p>

                    it wasn't a major event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, as you left we were pulling every lever we could think
                        of to get Marcos to do something, not getting rid of Marcos
                        particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: He still had the power. The opposition forces didn't impress us that
                    much. They certainly were divided. There was a problem, of course, that there
                    was a major Communist insurgency in the Philippines. The military felt a
                    continued need for the bases, particularly for Subic which was seen as a
                    counterweight to the increase of the Soviet presence in Vietnam. Nobody really
                    wanted us to leave in the Philippines, not even the Philippines neighbors in
                    southeast Asia, who were also unhappy with Marcos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel that the Philippines were sort of
                        unique in not being part of any other group? They were part of ASEAN, but
                        yet they weren't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: They were and they weren't. Formally, yes they were. But one always had
                    the feeling with the Philippines that far more important than the relationship
                    to ASEAN was their relationship with the United States. That in the last
                    analysis it was always going to be the United States that would bail them out.
                    And there was, of course, a special relationship. I recall a testimonial dinner
                    I went to when Marcos was around and Ramuelo was around, he was president of the
                    UNGA and was tremendously beloved by all manner of Americans. He was most
                    impressive. There were scores of American businessmen, media people, stars, etc.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left that job you left it with sort of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, things were not going well and we knew it. There didn't seem to be
                    a very clear way out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took your place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: My deputy, John Maisto, who had spent a lot of time in the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went for your last assignment over to the
                        National War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: That's right. I had decided at that point that I didn't really want to go
                    abroad again, because of family reasons and also because I felt that if I was
                    going to do something else with my life I had better do it soon rather than
                    later. I thought the War College would be a good transition. And it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: I was one of two State Department officers to be on the staff of the War
                    College. My responsibilities were twofold. One, to participate in the teaching
                    of international relations which occupied at that time a substantial chunk of
                    the academic curriculum at the War College. That is to say that every day when
                    we had a chief speaker, and we probably had the most glamorous accumulation of
                    speakers there...it is one of the attractions of the War College. After he or
                    she gave their talk and had a Q&amp;A, then the students would get together
                    again in smaller seminars and the staff would have another opportunity to go
                    over the same materials. That was one aspect.</p>
                <p>The other aspect was that in the afternoons we had so-called electives where the
                    students would concentrate on one area of the world for special study. That was
                    generally the same area to which they were then encouraged to go on their
                    two-week trips which took place in the spring and was one of the highlights of
                    the War College year. Of course I did northeast Asia—Japan and Korea. I put the
                    course together and taught it and had a lot of fun with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the men and women on the
                        military side who were passing through the college in relation to
                        international work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Well, there was a wide range of interest and capability, which was very
                    interesting to me. We had some absolutely superb officers and then there were
                    some who were not, frankly, all that interested and wondered why they were
                    chosen to come. There were some from the State Department like that. However,
                    three-quarters were military.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>One point about the military that struck me then as throughout my career and that
                    is that when it comes to the conduct of foreign relations and the study of
                    international relations generally, I found that it was, perhaps surprisingly,
                    the Army and the Marines who were the most knowledgeable and interested. The Air
                    Force and the Navy had less interest. I wondered about that and then came to an
                    answer to that. The Army and the Marine folks, by virtue of being on the ground,
                    come into more contact with the civilian communities, whether here or abroad.
                    Whereas the Navy and Air Force tended to be somewhat isolated where they are
                    stationed. That is one reason. But perhaps an even greater reason is that the
                    Air Force and Navy have now become, of course, super mechanized, super
                    technological and the kinds of people who are attracted to them are people who
                    are scientists or engineers, not social scientists, which perhaps is more what
                    appeals to the people-oriented rather than the thing-oriented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel the State Department people fitted into
                        the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: Oh, very well, I think. I think it is useful to have some good State
                    Department representation there because of the personal relationships that are
                    created. When you go off on a subsequent assignment after such an experience and
                    can have these personal memories of classes together it makes all the
                    difference, I think. Unfortunately, when I had that kind of experience at the
                    NATO Defense College, I went to Switzerland afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired then in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: At the end of 1986, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you get involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STRAUS: My objective was to remain involved with Japan and not to get another
                    permanent job. If possible to do a variety of things and I have been fortunate
                    in being able to do that. For a while I was doing the declassification of
                    documents but it wasn't really my bag. I enjoyed teaching much more. Right after
                    leaving the War College, I continued to teach my Northeast Asia course there.
                    Then, over the years I taught, again on Japan, at George Washington University,
                    William and Mary, Johns Hopkins and now very happily at Georgetown as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>In addition to that I have sporadically done some work for an organization called
                    Business Council for International Understanding where I brief American
                    businessmen going to Japan. And then for the last two years, ending in the fall
                    of 1992, I was running the Japanese and Korean language programs at the Foreign
                    Service Institute. I kind of enjoyed that, although the teaching of language
                    itself has not been my main interest. But I enjoyed the experience and working
                    again with Foreign Service officers and I think I made a contribution. When that
                    came to an end I was asked to stay on and I still have a contract with FSI. I
                    have now gotten involved with devising a new program for advanced training for
                    the superhard languages—Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic—with Japanese, perhaps
                    as the model. That got me back to Japan last fall, which was fun.</p>
