                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas J. Dunnigan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 24, 1993</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Thomas Dunnigan. I will be talking today with
                        Anthony Geber, a retired senior Foreign Service Officer. The date is August
                        24, 1993. Anthony Geber, or Tony, as he is known to his many friends had a
                        long and interesting career in the Foreign Service and I will ask him to
                        describe first of all his background and how he happened to become a Foreign
                        Service Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Let me say that I really became an FSO only in 1960 or 1961, but much that
                    went before that had some relevance to foreign affairs and foreign policy. I was
                    born and raised in Budapest, Hungary. My father was a senior civil servant in
                    the Hungarian government. On my mother's side, my grandfather was a very
                    successful businessman in the transportation field contributing to the flowering
                    of the Hungarian economy before World War I. I finished my high school, the
                    Gymnasium of the Piarist Fathers (a Catholic teaching order of high reputation
                    in several European countries but especially in Hungary). It was a humanistic
                    school where for eight years the emphasis was on Latin, history, languages and
                    Hungarian literature, but also on math, and science.</p>
                <p>I had the dream of becoming a foreign service officer in Hungary. So after
                    finishing high school, I inscribed at the political science and law faculty of
                    the University of Budapest and as it was possible in those days, I was
                    simultaneously attending the Consular Academy in Vienna which was the successor
                    of the old Austro-Hungarian foreign service school. There the emphasis was on
                    such courses as diplomatic history, international law, economics, languages. I
                    had some very distinguished colleagues while I was there, Kurt Waldheim and Jean
                    Sauvagnargues, later French Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>I finished in July 1938. In March of that year I experienced the Anschluss in
                    Vienna, Nazi Germany's takeover of Austria. I have one of those diplomas which
                    are historically interesting because the document stamps on the inside carry
                    still the Austrian double eagle while the outside cover has the swastika printed
                    on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The question was what next. The international situation in Central Europe looked
                    grim and my parents welcomed the opportunity which was offered to me to come to
                    the United States as a student with some help of the business connections of my
                    family. They strongly urged me to go. I expected to return to Hungary after a
                    year or two. I went to Chicago where I was first studying in the business school
                    at the University of Chicago but being more theoretically inclined, I switched
                    over and became a graduate student in the school of economics. At the same time
                    I was a part time employee of a company called General American Transportation
                    Corporation.</p>
                <p>By 1941 Hungary declared war on the United States and connections with my parents
                    became more and more difficult. I had to give up my studies and work full time
                    at the company to earn some money. In 1943 I received a greeting card signed FDR
                    and I was asked to join the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though you were not a citizen at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, that is right. I was a Hungarian citizen, but this notion of
                    recruiting foreigners, if they were residents of the United States existed then
                    and many years after that. When I was posted to the Embassy in Vienna, one of
                    our problems was that the neutral Austrian government didn't like it at all that
                    we were recruiting Austrian citizens residing in the United States to go to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I wasn't too happy to become a GI, but it turned out in retrospect that that was
                    about the best thing that happened to me. It taught me a great deal of
                    discipline and I became much more Americanized than I think I would have
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>After my basic training I was sent to the Hungarian language at area studies at
                    Stanford University which I didn't think was particularly needed in my case.
                    Next I was sent to the Army's the intelligence training center at Camp Ritchie
                    in the Catoctin mountains. In 1944 I was shipped over to Europe and ended up in
                    a counterintelligence corps detachment attached to the 94th division of the
                    American Army which was to surround the German pockets around Lorient and St.
                    Nazaire in Brittany. We would have stayed there until the end of the war except
                    that the Battle of the Bulge called for reinforcements. The division that was to
                    be thrown into that battle was torpedoed in the Channel; they replaced us in
                    Brittany and our division was sent into the battle of the Bulge. We got there
                    toward the end of the battle but it was still a rather grim situation in the
                    winter of 1944-45.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I experienced the end of the war in D�sseldorf and shortly after that I was
                    transferred to the headquarters of the US Control Group for Germany, first in
                    Versailles and then in H�chst outside of Frankfurt. Finally the headquarters
                    moved to Berlin and became the Office of Military Government for Germany, US
                    (OMGUS). Before moving to Berlin I was sent for a short period to London where
                    there was a special intelligence detachment. There I and my colleagues had the
                    interesting task of reviewing the files of Himmler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Heinrich Himmler head of the German SS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: That's right. The documents were referred to as HFFH, Himmler's files from
                    Hallein. Hallein was a small town in Austria and the files were stored in nearby
                    salt mines. Two things in those files remain vividly in my memory. Several
                    papers in those files documented how criminal the top leadership of Nazi Germany
                    was. I found those even more impressive than all the gruesome sights that we
                    have gained from pictures of the concentration camps. Concentration camp guards
                    one could assume were sadists, but here it was high level policy people who
                    could put down on paper plans to exterminate the Poles, the Jews, to reduce the
                    biological strength of the French by collecting dark haired and brown eyed
                    French children and send them ostensibly on vacation to Finland to be drowned in
                    the Finnish lakes. Other interesting documents dealt with conditions in Soviet
                    union under German occupation. Of interest from today's perspective was a paper
                    which described the joyful reception of the German army in the Ukraine as
                    liberators from the Stalinist oppression; only the brutality and incompetence of
                    the Nazi occupation leaders turned the population into fierce partisans in less
                    than a year.</p>
                <p>I should explain how I became a civil servant from being a military man. I
                    arrived in the devastated Berlin on October 1, 1945.I was close to being
                    discharged from the Army and being sent back to the United States. But having
                    gotten this far, I was very anxious visit my parents who survived the Nazi
                    occupation and the Russian conquest of Budapest. Initially at that time the
                    Russians did not give entry permits to Hungary for American army personnel on
                    furlough. But at the very end of 1945 they opened up for compassionate leave
                    cases, such as visiting close relatives. For various and sundry reasons my trip
                    to Budapest from Berlin took two months rather than two weeks. I said goodby to
                    my parents leaving with the belief that I would be returning to the United
                    States. When I got back to Berlin, a army officer working in the office of
                    Ambassador Murphy and whom I had approached earlier because I heard that he had
                    planned to go on an official trip to Budapest, called me that he was now ready
                    to go and am I still interested in going. I said, “Well, I just got back half an
                    hour ago. My superiors are very anxious to ship me off to the United States, but
                    if you can negotiate my release for this trip, I would be very pleased to
                    go.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tony if I can just mention here that Ambassador Murphy was
                        political advisor to General Clay, the military governor for Germany.
                        Ambassador Murphy's office was in effect rather similar to an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: This was negotiated. I was given two options either to sign up for another
                    six months in the Army or become a civilian employee of the military government.
                    The choice was not very difficult to make and I became a civilian employee of
                    the military government. That is the way my actual bureaucratic career
                    started.</p>
                <p>Our task in the Office of the Director of Intelligence, OMGUS was to write
                    analytical reports independent of the operational offices governing occupied
                    Germany. I became economic analyst.</p>
                <p>To describe what we were doing at that time, first of all we kept an eye on what
                    was going on in the Soviet zone. We found that Soviet policy was aimed at a very
                    systematic destruction of the economy of the zone through large scale
                    dismantling of the industries there. The unrestrained printing of German
                    currency by the Soviet authorities also helped the plundering of the zone;
                    furthermore it undermined the economic functioning and stability of the Western
                    zones of occupation. Furthermore, the Soviets intended to gain a command
                    position in the economy of their zone through nationalizing most private
                    enterprises and then bringing all major industries under joint Soviet and German
                    ownership. Their central economic command system with its artificial and
                    distorting price structure, though not specifically aimed at the weakening of
                    the economy, made for a very inefficient economic structure.</p>
                <p>The French were also eager to dismantle German industrial machinery and transfer
                    them to France as reparations. Still, one must admit that the French were much
                    more adept to meld in with the Germans than any of the other occupation powers.
                    They did not build conspicuous PX-s, Commissaries, housing quarters, as did the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>In the US and British zones, which were soon joined in a joint administration, we
                    discovered fairly early that we had a choice either to follow the Morgenthau
                    Plan's goal of turning Germany into an agrarian economy and take on a tremendous
                    economic burden of sustaining a German population even just above the poverty
                    level, or change policy and make Germany viable and self-reliant.</p>
                <p>We soon realized that the dismantling of German factories was neither in the
                    interest of Germany nor particularly in our interest. With this realization we
                    began moving on a collision course with the Russians regarding the objectives of
                    our occupation policies in Germany. The creation of an economic vacuum in the
                    center of Europe would be positively harmful for us and for our Western allies
                    in Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I can claim that I played at least a minor role in reversing our policy regarding
                    the dismantling of German industrial capacity. Being more detached and more
                    independent in the Office of the Director of Intelligence than the operational
                    offices, our reports carried more influence with Washington.</p>
                <p>But I also had another avenue to influence policy. I had a good friend in the
                    British military government, Fritz Schumacher, who was the senior economic
                    advisor to the British Military Governor. Fritz was a non-Jewish German refugee
                    from Nazi Germany who went to England shortly before the war. He became quite
                    famous later with a little book entitled “Small is Beautiful”. He and I had
                    shared views on how counterproductive our dismantling policies were. I
                    discovered how poor the documentation was on which our dismantling policies were
                    based. We were relying on translated documents on German industrial capacity and
                    there were mistakes in the translations, mislabeling of technical terms, etc. I
                    could feed this information to Schumacher who reported directly to his Military
                    Governor.</p>
                <p>In retrospect it was ironical that Germany gained from having its old,
                    technologically somewhat obsolete industrial plants dismantled and replaced with
                    much newer equipment.</p>
                <p>As I already mentioned, the Russians created much of the monetary overhang by
                    printing German money and thereby were at least partly responsible for the
                    inflation and the severe disruption of a functioning monetary system. How bad
                    things were I can illustrate with two stories. In Berlin I knew a high ranking
                    economic official who, when we established the joint economic administration in
                    the US/UK zones in Minden, had to move there. Shortly after I met him in Minden
                    and he told me of a problem he were faced with his family. His children needed
                    shoes to go to school and he got rationing coupons with which he could acquire
                    wooden soles. Ingenious as he was, he was going to make sandals — not the best
                    in winter, but better than nothing — by detaching the leather straps from the
                    school bags of his children. At that point he was stumped because he couldn't
                    get any nails with which to attach the leather straps to the soles. Mind you, he
                    was a high ranking official of the German economic administration.</p>
                <p>Around that time in 1947 my mother visited me in Berlin from war torn and Soviet
                    occupied Budapest and she was absolutely appalled how little merchandise was
                    available in the shops compared to Budapest. It was a cigarette economy where a
                    pack of American cigarettes sold on the gray market for the equivalent of a full
                    month's pay of a skilled worker. If you worked in camera factory or a textile
                    factory you were given a monthly bonus of a camera or a bolt of textile which
                    you could exchange for something useful, such as food to supplement the
                    starvation rations. But if you were a steel worker or worked on the railroads,
                    you could not very well take home a steel ingot or a rail to trade in for
                    something else.</p>

                <p>Finally, the Western occupying powers, in coordination with the German
                    authorities, decided to institute currency reform. It was a great success and
                    the beginning of the “German economic miracle”. That it pretty much coincided
                    with the launching of the Marshall Plan for Western European economic
                    cooperation and the massive infusion of American aid and also helped. But the
                    reform which gave the Germans a hard and stable currency changed practically
                    everything like a touch with a magic wand. Some people suffered some hardships
                    initially, but suddenly from one day to another, all the hidden goods that were
                    stored somewhere in warehouses or basements and attics appeared in shop windows
                    and the German economy recovered very rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the short run it also brought the Berlin Blockade,
                        didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, it certainly did. We tried to persuade the Soviets to join us in
                    instituting the currency reform. But they procrastinated and when we decided to
                    go ahead without them with currency reform in the Western zones Germany became
                    divided and remained so for forty years. Also, the Soviets retaliated with an
                    economic blockade of West Berlin. We responded with economic sanctions against
                    the Soviet zone and an airlift to bring in essential food, fuel and other
                    necessities into beleaguered Berlin. We, in the Office of Intelligence played a
                    major part in assessing the requirements and effectiveness of the economic
                    sanctions directed at the Soviet zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask, Tony, this was a little more than three years
                        after the end of our war with Germany, were you in your official capacity in
                        mid-1948 in touch with German officials or mainly Allied officials? Were you
                        treated with respect, friendship or in what matter by these Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Well, with both. We had exceptionally harmonious relations with the German
                    authorities, with the legendary Mayor Reuter in Berlin and his very able staff,
                    and also with the German authorities in West Germany. And the friendship
                    extended well beyond official relations. We had the warmest support of the
                    population and there gratitude for what we were trying to do for them. Nowhere
                    else in my subsequent posting did I experience that kind of friendship and
                    cooperation, with the possible exception in Austria in the late 1960's and early
                    70's, where the gratitude and good feeling toward America lingered on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were very difficult and serious days, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. It was not at all certain that our policies would or could succeed.
                    The Russians had it in their power to tighten the screws of economic
                    strangulation around Berlin, to interfere with the planes of the airlift or even
                    to take over Berlin militarily. The airlift was a major heroic undertaking and
                    somewhat of a gamble that it can provide the city with the minimum requirement
                    for sustaining its population. It also meant considerable hardship for the
                    people of Berlin to survive on the basis of the reduced supplies, and it was a
                    question how long that hardship can be endured. In the end the West has won and
                    the Soviets lifted the embargo on Berlin. What changed their mind was the
                    successful perseverance of the Western Powers and the Germans, and even more so,
                    the realization that their blockade of Berlin speeded the political and security
                    integration of West Germany into the Western alliance.</p>
                <p>During those early years in occupied Germany I gained several valuable insights
                    into what makes for successful international trade. We, the American occupation
                    power, were making strenuous efforts to promote German exports. Later in my
                    career a good part of my duties consisted of trying to promote American exports
                    to the countries of my assignment. In Germany at that time we were distributing
                    Care packages to German miners as incentives to increase their production and
                    exports of coal. The economic editor of the leading German daily remarked to me
                    then that Germany will have succeeded as a major trading country not when it
                    exports one or two major commodities but when its trade structure consists of
                    millions of individual transactions of such items as ballpoint pens. Translated
                    to my later experience, this meant that important as it was to secure the deals
                    on such big ticket items for American companies as airplanes and nuclear power
                    plants, that alone would not make America into a major trading country.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you another anecdote which became part of my learning experience. A
                    friend of mine from Chicago, who then worked for a major manufacturing company,
                    came to visit Germany. He was exploring the possibility of importing industrial
                    abrasives from Germany. He found a couple of potential suppliers. But he said in
                    the end, “You know, I found suppliers in Germany whose product was excellent,
                    perhaps better than what we have in the United States. Their prices were quite
                    competitive. But that is not enough. Sitting in Chicago it is much easier to
                    call up your supplier in Kalamazoo. For most Americans dealing with foreign
                    exchange, customs, filling out forms, etc. are bothersome, not to speak of the
                    fact that it means traveling to a foreign country where they speak a different
                    language, eat different food, etc. It is much more convenient to order something
                    from Kalamazoo.” Nearly fifty years later much has changed in the attitudes of
                    American businessmen, but the point is still valid that, contrary to the claims
                    of the theorists of international trade, quality and price are often not the
                    only factors which move goods across international borders. The large and
                    generally homogeneous American market has structurally favored domestic trade
                    over foreign trade. It also provides the more export oriented foreign countries
                    incentives to concentrate their efforts on the American market.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Lastly, still another story from those early days I spent in Germany which
                    reinforces the lessons I just described. I was called upon to accompany a high
                    level mission of American industrialists, mostly from US steel companies, to
                    advise on the allies dismantling policies. At one of the major steel plants in
                    the Ruhr the Americans were surprised to find three or four rolling mills side
                    by side; in America a similar plant would only have one. They asked the German
                    managers why they need those mills. The Germans explained that they were an
                    exporting country to all parts of the globe and they needed that kind of
                    capacity to service their clients to the specifications they wanted. The
                    Americans were quite amazed. They said, “Well, we export too, but we tell our
                    clients what we have and if they like it they can take it, if they don't, they
                    don't.” Even to this day we hear complaints from potential buyers of American
                    products why American exporters cannot provide the right plugs for their
                    electric appliances or right hand steering wheels for cars to countries where
                    they drive on the left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Tony, I noticed that in 1954 you were converted to an
                        organization known as the Foreign Operations Administration, the FOA, which
                        I believe was implementing the Marshall Plan abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, but that was after I left Germany and let me just finish briefly my
                    account of my activities in Germany during the last few years I spent there. In
                    1948 after the Berlin blockade started, the Office of the Director of
                    Intelligence was moved from Berlin to the American zone, first to N�rnberg and
                    then to Bad Nauheim, in the vicinity in Frankfurt. Then in 1950, I was
                    transferred back to Berlin to an outfit called the Eastern Element which was set
                    up to do peripheral reporting on the Soviet zone of Germany. I became the head
                    of the economic section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Eastern Element was part of the State Department
                        office in Berlin was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. Those were still tense days. Although the blockade was lifted, the
                    Soviets and the East German government continued to harass West Berlin and the
                    economic viability of the isolated city was at stake. Our major weapon was still
                    economic sanctions against the so-called German Democratic Republic (GDR). But I
                    must confess that I began to wonder whether economic sanctions really were an
                    effective tool. In the earlier days, I was one of the really Cold War warriors
                    against the Eastern zone. I thought sanctions were very effective, partly
                    because the East's economy was so closely tied to the West and it was difficult
                    for them to switch over rapidly to other sources of supply. Also, the Western
                    allies, in close collaboration with the German authorities, had effective
                    control over the movement of goods from the West to the Soviet Zone. As time
                    passed these factors diminished in making sanctions effective. By the time I was
                    assigned to Vienna in the late 60's I became very dubious about the usefulness
                    of our export controls. We tried to maintain more stringent export controls
                    against the Soviet block countries than our European allies which meant that on
                    many items on our export control list there were adequate other sources of
                    supply. Also, by then a huge network of trading connections were developed,
                    often illegal but difficult to control, in response to lucrative incentives
                    aimed at evading the American restrictions.</p>
                <p>During my assignment at Eastern Element I had the dubious pleasure of having to
                    read every morning the T�gliche Rundschau and the Neues Deutschland, the East
                    German equivalents of Pravda and Izvestia. They were so obviously mendacious, so
                    boring, so devoid of any redeeming literary virtue, that I concluded that no
                    half sane society can endure for long the imposition of such daily fare of news.
                    It is a tragedy that it took nearly forty years before this unnatural state of
                    affairs came to an end.</p>
                <p>In 1952, I was again switched from Berlin to Bonn and there into the political
                    division where John Patton Davis, one of the old China hands, was the head of
                    the office. He was a brilliant officer and perhaps more unjustly than any of his
                    colleagues involved with China policy at the end of the war, became victim of
                    McCarthyism. He came to Germany from the Policy Planning section of the
                    Department and found that there had not been much long-term thinking about
                    Germany. He assembled a small group of people to analyze the underlying
                    political and social forces shaping the likely development of Germany. I was
                    tasked to write about what makes the German business community tick. I wrote a
                    report, the gist of which was that the German business community had been and
                    continues to be rather apolitical unless its immediate interests are at
                    stake.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Also, I was put in charge at the Bonn end of Berlin affairs, and also of the Saar
                    problem. In fact, I was sent to the Saar for briefly because the State
                    Department became suspicious that the reporting on the Saar from our Consulate
                    in Strasbourg was overly biased in favor of the French. Under the guise of some
                    economic expertise to assess the economic interdependence of the Saar with
                    France and Germany I was to gauge the political and economic trends in the Saar.
                    I rapidly came to the conclusion the French policy of retaining the Saar by
                    every means within the French orbit was not going to last very long and that the
                    Saar would revert to Germany. The elite of the Saarlanders, though trying to be
                    loyal to the French authorities, resented the heavy handed methods of the
                    occupying power. Economic questions were very secondary. The only mistake in my
                    report was that the Saar reverted to Germany sooner than I expected.</p>
                <p>As Berlin “desk officer” in Bonn the most significant event I witnessed was the
                    1953 uprising in East Germany, the first which periodically racked the Soviet
                    orbit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the famous June 17th uprising?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. Our response was a very clever scheme; we were offering CARE packages
                    to East Germans who would come to West Berlin to pick them up. It turned out to
                    be a huge propaganda success. The East Germans came in large droves thereby
                    giving a vote of confidence to the West with their feet. But by the end of the
                    summer it became clear that this project reached a point of diminishing returns.
                    School buildings in West Berlin which were used as distribution points had to be
                    vacated, and, much more importantly, the East German government was taking
                    increasingly effective countermeasures, endangering the life and well-being of
                    the brave East Germans. When I was asked to report telephonically to Eleanor
                    Dulles, who was the leading force in the Department behind this campaign, that
                    both of the West German government and the allies felt that time has come to end
                    this campaign, she gave me a tongue lashing. But the campaign was ended; Eleanor
                    and I remained friends for years after.</p>
                <p>At the end of 1953 I left Germany under a cloud. Perhaps I ought to say a few
                    words about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course. I think that would be of interest.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GEBER: My parents were still in Budapest and there the extreme Stalinist regime
                    raged. One of the many cruel things they started against their “class enemies”
                    in the early '50s was the deportation of those from Budapest to miserable,
                    impoverished villages. My parents were to be among them. But shortly before that
                    happened, my mother impressed the Dutch Minister with her determination to
                    resist that danger just as she and my father resisted the perils of the Nazi
                    occupation and the Soviet “liberation”. He offered them to move into an
                    apartment in a building belonging to and adjoining the Dutch Embassy. After my
                    parents lived there for nearly a year the Dutch Minister wrote me that I should
                    try to find some way to get them out of Hungary. He expected to leave Budapest
                    shortly, and he would prefer not to pass on the problem to his successor.
                    Furthermore, if the Hungarians were to request officially their extradition, he
                    would have no choice but to comply.</p>
                <p>My search for ways to get my parents out of Hungary turned up various rumors and
                    missed opportunities. Only one avenue seemed to be open, to entrust their fate
                    to a man, then living in Vienna, and who was engaged in smuggling people out of
                    Hungary. To make a long story short, I left the decision up to my parents, the
                    man contacted them, my parents were disinclined to undertake the risk, which
                    would have meant marching through fields in winter, but agreed to meet with the
                    man once more before giving their final answer. Evidently the man was caught by
                    the police before that second meeting and was never heard from again. The police
                    must have gotten the names of the people he had contacted, and my parents were
                    arrested on their way to visit my father's brother who just then suffered a
                    massive stroke.</p>
                <p>A few months later I received in Bonn a rather suspicious letter, presumably from
                    a lawyer who offered to help my parents but needed to meet me somewhere in the
                    West. Nothing came of this and it turned out that it was the Hungarian
                    intelligence service which tried to contact me. This information was obtained
                    from a high level police officer who defected and was interrogated by our
                    intelligence services in Vienna.</p>
                <p>These were the days of Senator McCarthy in Washington. Although every step I had
                    undertaken in connection with my parents' misfortune I had reported to my
                    superiors, and it was clear that I would resist any blackmail by the Hungarian
                    authorities, our security people were nervous and they first restricted me to
                    the handling of unclassified material and shortly after I was dismissed from the
                    Service as a security risk.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington and was offered leave without pay allowing me to look
                    around for a non-sensitive job in Washington. Just about that time I received
                    news that my mother died in jail ten days before she would have been released
                    and my father completed his jail term. With this new information, the State
                    Department undertook to review my security status and the final and favorable
                    decision was taken by no less a person then Mr. Scott McLeod, who was the great
                    security honcho.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>This did not quite end my problem. I had to find a job. From about March until
                    about late June 1954 I had a number of very attractive offers from various
                    agencies. But each time I was turned down because one agency of the government
                    was not willing to accept the security clearance of another agency. Among these
                    offers was one that would have sent me to Indonesia as the program officer of
                    our foreign aid mission there. But the security people of FOA turned me down.
                    Couple of months passed when I got a phone call from Howard Jones, who had been
                    the head of the American High Commissioner's office in Berlin when I was
                    stationed there. He told me that he is going to Indonesia as the head of the
                    American aid mission there and asked me if I would be willing to go as his
                    program officer. I told him that that job was offered me earlier but that I was
                    turned down by the security people. He obviously knew that and after I told him
                    the whole story I was sworn in two days later as program officer and went off to
                    Indonesia. Thus began an entirely new world for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only a new world Tony but at that time dominated by
                        Mr. Sukarno who had taken over after the Dutch had left and our relations
                        were not entirely easy, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: No, Mr. Sukarno was not the easiest person to deal with. We had a very
                    large technical assistance program covering agriculture, industry, health,
                    including a large scale malaria eradication program, education, vocational
                    training, housing and a contract for consultative services to the Planning
                    Bureau of the Indonesian government. The foreign aid mission had no major
                    capital investment program but the Export-Import Bank extended loans for the
                    rehabilitation of the Indonesian railroad system and financed the erection of
                    the first large cement factory.</p>
                <p>Mr. Sukarno had a number of admirable and an equal number of less admirable
                    qualities. He was a true patriot and a spell-binding orator who could inspire
                    his people and imbue it with a great deal of national cohesion despite great
                    diversity and poor communications within this far-flung island empire. But he
                    had delusions of grandeur. He was prone to divert attention from domestic
                    difficulties to foreign adventures. He was also much more interested in
                    politics, and was only haphazardly and intermittently interested in promoting
                    economic development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tony could that partly be due to the fact that he always
                        counted on certain oil revenues to keep his government solvent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Well, not so much at that time, although American oil companies were there
                    and doing quite well. Rubber and tin were also major exports, as well as timber.
                    Still, the economy was steadily going down hill during the years that I was
                    there and after.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>An insight into Mr. Sukarno's psyche was provided right after his state visit to
                    the United States which our Ambassador, Hugh Cumming, arranged successfully. Mr.
                    Sukarno was quite impressed. He was given the red carpet treatment, including
                    visits with Hollywood starlets. He came back quite pleasantly disposed toward
                    the United States. His feeling of goodwill toward the United States resulted in
                    his acceptance of an invitation for the celebration of the Fourth of July, not
                    from the Embassy — that would have been too much to expect from him — but from a
                    private American society the members of which were mostly American businessmen.
                    So there we were in a large garden in July. Turkey was just served when Mr.
                    Sukarno launched into a more than an hour long speech. The gist of the speech
                    was that there are two conflicts in the world, one between communism and
                    capitalism...but this was really a sideshow, nobody ever took it very seriously,
                    no lives were lost, etc. The other major and much more important conflict was
                    between colonialism, neo-colonialism and national independence movements. He
                    didn't quite say so, but the real villain was the United States. Having to
                    listen to this for an hour and letting my turkey cool was a little difficult to
                    take.</p>
                <p>August 17 is Merdeka Day, the Indonesian national holiday, which was celebrated
                    with stunning dance performances in the garden of the presidential palace. That
                    year Ambassador Cumming was invited as a specially honored guest in grateful
                    recognition of having arranged Sukarno's visit to the US Little did he expect
                    that another special guest, whom he had to meet on an elevated platform, was to
                    be Madame Sun Yat-sen, the widow of the famed Chinese national hero and the
                    ardent supporter of the Communists in China. An elaborate quadrille was
                    performed on that platform; when Madame Sun Yat-sen circled to the right of Mr.
                    Sukarno Ambassador toured to the left, and vice-versa. These were the little
                    tricks that Sukarno enjoyed playing on the Americans.</p>
                <p>Our personal contacts with many Indonesians was most rewarding. We had many
                    Indonesian friends. I had great respect for the ability and kindness of the
                    Indonesians. It is true though that practically by natural selection our social
                    contacts were with the most “westernized” members of Indonesian society. Most of
                    them were members or supporters of the PSI, the Indonesian Socialist party, who
                    were in the opposition to Sukarno's ruling party and whose political fortunes
                    were declining. I witnessed the first general elections in independent
                    Indonesia. The Embassy's projections of the likely outcome were far off the
                    mark. Admittedly it was not easy to predict the elections. My wife and I asked
                    our djongos, our house boy, before the elections which party he is going to vote
                    for. He said he has not yet made up his mind, either the Masjumi, the Islamic
                    party which at that time was leaning toward the West and was in opposition to
                    the government, or the Communists. His choice was between the extreme
                    opposites.</p>
                <p>The Nahdlatul Ulama, the party of the conservative Muslim teachers, but which for
                    opportunistic reasons supported Sukarno, made a strong showing in the elections.
                    I remember that shortly after the results of the election became known one of
                    the political officers came over to us in the foreign aid mission asking whether
                    any of us had any personal contact with a member of the Nahdlatul Ulama. The
                    Embassy had none; neither did we in the mission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it not at that time, Tony, that the Bandung Conference
                        took place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps you might give us your impression of the
                        situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Well, it was a great propaganda coup for Sukarno. Nehru, Tito, Zhou En-lai
                    and a host of lesser dignitaries came to the meeting. Zhou En-lai outshone them
                    all with his winning personality. It was a three ring circus long on PR and
                    short on specifics. But it did launch the numerically large grouping of
                    non-aligned nations. This group was to be neutral between the Western
                    democracies and the Soviet block nations. In practice its political and economic
                    demands were directed against the West, simply because they knew that only from
                    them can they obtain significant concessions. The group was far from homogeneous
                    in its interests, but it was easy for them to suppress their divergences when it
                    was a matter of making demands on the West. Most of these were pursued in the
                    UN, its functional and regional agencies, where the one-nation-one-vote favored
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Embassy allowed to have any observers in

                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Oh, yes, we had observers in Bandung, and they were duly concerned about
                    the proceedings, although at that time it was mostly the propaganda effect of
                    the meeting which was disturbing.</p>
                <p>Let me comment a little bit about my experience with technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GEBER: As I told you our technical assistance program was operating practically
                    in every field. For each field of activity there was a division chief who spent
                    much of his time at Mission headquarters do all the extensive paper work,
                    preparing project proposals with detailed justification, budget estimates,
                    procurement requirements. Part of his time he spent in the corresponding
                    Indonesian Ministry or agency, discussing the projects and seeing to it that the
                    Indonesian agencies did their part to implement the program. The projects
                    usually consisted of two main elements, American technical experts who were to
                    train Indonesians, and Indonesian trainees who were sent to the United States to
                    be short term training in their respective fields. As I believe is apparent of
                    this brief description, the implementation of these activities required
                    exceptional management talent which was often lacking on the American side and
                    even more in the Indonesian government agencies. We lacked an adequate
                    experienced cadre to fill the jobs. Most of the technical experts were recruited
                    from domestic agencies. But for instance, an employee of the American
                    agricultural extension service may have been exceptionally competent in the area
                    of his expertise, irrigation, soil management, etc., but when he came to
                    Indonesia he needed additional qualifications, as organizational talent, empathy
                    for different cultures. These were difficult to spell out in a job description.
                    Some of them had the natural talent and did very good work; others did not.
                    Often it took a long period for these American technical experts to settle in
                    with their families, find their way around in the Indonesian bureaucracy. The
                    delivery of the training materials they ordered took many months to arrive. Many
                    of them left after the end of their two year duty, and often there was a long
                    hiatus before their successors arrived.Even more questionable to my mind was the
                    overall planning of the program. Soon after I arrived in Indonesia as the
                    Mission's Program Officer I had to go through the exercise of preparing the
                    yearly plan to be submitted to Washington for approval. The plan had to start
                    out with a statement on US national interest and objectives in Indonesia, such
                    as containing communism. The next step was to argue that promoting economic
                    development supports this US objective. To make these linkages down to the
                    justification of asking for one additional trainer in automotive mechanics in a
                    vocational training program, or to recommend the phasing out of a housing
                    project because the Indonesian counterparts where organizationally incompetent,
                    demonstrates the phoniness of such a highly centralized operation. One of my
                    early battles with Washington was that in preparing the plan we had to fill out
                    a box on a form projecting the growth rate of the Indonesian economy for several
                    years ahead. There was a UN team at that time in Indonesia trying to construct
                    the first national accounts for Indonesia. They were engaged in making
                    calculations and estimates for several years back on the basis of inadequate
                    statistics. I thought that making any GNP projection for the years ahead would
                    be irresponsible.</p>
                <p>In the end I lost the battle. I was told to put in any number, but it essential
                    that I fill in the box. Much to my amazement a couple of years later when I was
                    back in Washington I saw a printed hard cover book on the Indonesian economy
                    which contained those figures which I picked out of thin air.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are one of the little triumphs we have in the
                        Foreign Service. Let me ask you, did you have a feeling that you were in
                        competition with your Soviet counterparts while you were in Jakarta to pour
                        aid into the country? I know we couldn't put military aid in there because
                        of Indonesia's neutrality policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Oh, we had some military aid and we certainly had some aid to the police
                    and security forces. Indonesia was in the throws of various regional uprisings,
                    including banditry in the western part of Java. My director, Howard Jones, and I
                    visited some of the military outposts there. I remember asking one of the
                    military chiefs as to why he had so much difficulty oppressing banditry. During
                    the day time it was quite safe to travel in the region but it was not
                    recommended to do so at night. He said, “Who do you think the bandits are? They
                    are my soldiers.”</p>
                <p>Actually, the aid to the military, mostly training, was a very good investment.
                    The military leaders appreciated the aid given and were by and large western
                    oriented, which paid off years later when the showdown came between the military
                    and Sukarno.</p>
                <p>Russian aid began to arrive only after I left Indonesia. The Russians were much
                    more accommodating to Sukarno's wishes, for instance, by building a grandiose
                    sports stadium. Mike Harris, whom I knew from Germany where he was the very able
                    Marshall Plan administrator, and who was the Ford Foundation representative in
                    Indonesia during the years I was there, and several years after told me a very
                    interesting story. On his way back from Indonesia in India he was introduced by
                    our Embassy people to a Russian diplomat who evidently held an important
                    position previously in Moscow in the Russian foreign aid administration. His
                    first question to Harris was how could he stand it for that many years working
                    with the inefficient Indonesians. That question obviously opened the way for a
                    rather frank discussion. When Harris ventured to suggest that it was easier for
                    the Russians to extend foreign aid because they did not have to give detailed
                    justification for everything to congressional oversight, his Russian
                    interlocutor replied that Harris is mistaken; although there is not that close
                    examination by often hostile committees, there is considerable political
                    pressure on Khrushchev why Indonesia gets a sport stadium when Tiflis or Baku
                    has none.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you one more question if I may. Our Secretary
                        of State during those years was John Foster Dulles and I remember that he
                        proclaimed widely that neutrality was wicked. How was this received in
                        Indonesia and did it affect at all relations between Indonesia and our
                        Embassy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GEBER: Not very significantly, at least not on the day-to- day operations of the
                    Embassy. Sukarno and his advisers undoubtedly believed that Mr. Dulles was wrong
                    in opposing the “non-alignment” of Indonesia and other third world countries and
                    they were opposed to the kind of military alliances, such as SEATO, which we
                    were promoting in those days. They were also suspicious of less militaristic
                    projects aimed at advancing regional cooperation and cohesion, such as was to be
                    considered at the initiative of India at a conference held in Simla, and which
                    we supported; here it was more the Indonesians resentment against the Indians
                    playing big brother. Mr. Dulles and the AID Administrator, Mr. Hollister,
                    visited Indonesia, I believe in 1955, on their way to a Colombo Plan meeting in
                    Singapore. They paid a call on Mr. Sukarno which went off quite well.</p>
                <p>The kind of tendency in Indonesian politics that I described with my little
                    anecdote about the Fourth of July speech of Mr. Sukarno continued and we had our
                    disagreements but it really hadn't affected our relationship too much until
                    later after when Mr. Sukarno laid eyes on Irian-Jaya, the Dutch held part of New
                    Guinea, and his “confrontation” policies toward Malaysia and the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>While I was in Indonesia I was also sent to Cambodia in 1956 on temporary duty
                    for a couple of months to pinch hit there as program officer in the aid mission.
                    The poor Cambodian aid mission...I was the third or fourth temporary program
                    officer because Washington was unable to fill the job. The director of the
                    mission was a very attractive, cultured person who spoke impeccable French. He
                    was a labor lawyer from Washington before he went to Cambodia to be mission
                    director. In that job he was much too nice, especially in his dealings with
                    Washington to be effective. He had a hard driving ambassador. When I called on
                    him after I arrived he pulled out his desk drawer and took out a sheaf of
                    papers, they were weekly reprimands by the ambassador on how poorly he did his
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt to ask who the ambassador was then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Bob McClintock. He was very able, one of the youngest ambassadors we had.
                    But I think an insight into his character was a framed document on his office
                    wall from Stanford where he had won a debating prize. He was prone to shoot from
                    the hip. I had the good fortune that he knew me from my days in Germany and so
                    did his political counselor, Martin Herz. I did not have to struggle to
                    establish my credentials.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The Ambassador confirmed to me that he really was having problems with his aid
                    mission. For instance, he asked the mission to give him a projection of how long
                    it would take to phase out the military support program. This was a very large
                    program of commodity imports to support the Cambodian military budget.
                    Unfortunately the aid mission could not come up with an answer, they did not
                    have a competent economist on their staff. Ambassador McClintock then turned to
                    his military who in good military fashion came up with a bar beautiful bar chart
                    within the allotted deadline of one week. It showed that in the first two years
                    the military support program would have to be kept at the same level but that it
                    could rapidly decline in the next two years. I asked the Ambassador to let me
                    look into this. I got hold of the Colonel who prepared the chart. The Colonel
                    admitted that he didn't have much to go on but the presence of a fairly large
                    aid mission whose task was to improve the Cambodian economy justified his
                    assumption reflected in the chart. I reported back to the Ambassador that in my
                    opinion the only basis for the chart that was that the colonel who prepared it
                    had a tour of duty in Cambodia for the next two years after which it was to be
                    somebody else's problem..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Ambassador's reaction to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: I think he laughed.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington in 1957. I continued a little while longer with the
                    foreign aid organization as Ethiopian desk officer. I was only there for about
                    nine months and I never got to Ethiopia. I can only say that, contrary to my
                    expectations — after all the Emperor was a great friend of the West — the
                    day-to-day dealings with the Ethiopians on foreign aid matters were even more
                    difficult than with the Indonesians.</p>
                <p>At the very end of 1957 I transferred back to the State Department, to the Office
                    of Economic Development and Finance in the Bureau of Economic Affairs. There our
                    task was to develop economic policies toward the third world, and to see to it
                    that there was some consistency in those policies. I was involved in the
                    preparations of the establishment of the Inter-American Development Bank, in the
                    setting up of the Development Loan Fund which moved much of US aid away from the
                    comprehensive country program approach I described earlier to the financing of
                    sound projects. We analyzed aid programs and projects in the various developing
                    regions and brought our views to bear in consultations with the regional bureaus
                    and with the foreign aid agency, whose initials were by then changed, if I
                    remember correctly, to ICA.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had battles with an excessively niggardly and ideologically hide bound
                    Treasury Department; for instance, we could not clear any paper with Treasury
                    that contained the word “planning”. We also had fights with some of the regional
                    bureaus in the Department which felt that their clients should be exempted from
                    the application of consistent policies. An interesting example of this was the
                    African Bureau's argument that most of the African countries cannot be expected
                    to prepare well thought out projects for American foreign aid financing, and for
                    political reasons, especially to counter Soviet influence, the US should commit
                    lines of credit in advance of fundable projects. ICA, with some justification,
                    objected to this approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there actually an African Bureau then or was it still
                        part of NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: It was the African Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't many independent countries until
                        1960...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: There must have been. I would have to check the dates but I believe that,
                    for instance, Ghana, Guinea and several of the West African countries have by
                    then gained their independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you straddled the whole problem of African
                        independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. The dispute between the African Bureau and ICA occurred still under
                    the Eisenhower administration. Mr. Dillon was Under Secretary for Economic
                    Affairs in the State Department. He tasked ICA, the African Bureau and the
                    Bureau of Economic Affairs to come up with recommendations on how to deal with
                    aid to Africa. Martin Herz was representing the African Bureau and I
                    participated for the Economic Bureau. We were to submit a recommendation to Mr.
                    Dillon and, if we could not resolve our differences, we were to submit options.
                    We met may times, missed several deadlines, and never submitted a report. The
                    African Bureau and ICA could not resolve their differences and both resisted
                    submitting options for Mr. Dillon to decide, the one arguing that Mr. Dillon is
                    an investment banker and economist and therefore will not give sufficient weight
                    to political considerations, and the other side claiming that he as Under
                    Secretary of State would be biased against sound economic management of aid
                    projects and give preference to political factors. The Eisenhower administration
                    came to an end and Mr. Dillon left the State Department without any resolution
                    of the issue. I thought that this little exercise was worth mentioning as a
                    particularly telling example of the occasionally tragicomic workings of
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I mentioned Martin Herz. As you may recall, I also met him during my temporary
                    duty assignment in Cambodia. Actually this was my third encounter with Martin.
                    The first was when I was dealing with the Saar problem in Bonn. Martin was at
                    the Embassy in Paris and was arguing that the whole French political system
                    would collapse if we don't strongly support the French policy towards the Saar.
                    As you know the Saar became part of Germany and the French Republic survived.
                    The second encounter was in Cambodia. He was the Political Counselor, having
                    known me and trusting my judgement, made my brief work in Cambodia much easier.
                    In exercise on the African aid program he was tenaciously defending his bureau's
                    interests. Martin Herz was not the easiest person to deal with but I had very
                    high respect for him. He was a very able and energetic Foreign Service Officer
                    very dedicated, hard working and productive. His book, 215 Days in the Life of
                    an American Ambassador, giving an account of his Ambassadorship in Bulgaria, and
                    his many publications after his retirement at the Georgetown School of Foreign
                    Service, should be required reading for all budding Foreign Service officers. I
                    had many pleasant contacts with him at Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was dedicated and very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER:The Kennedy Administration came in while I was still in the Bureau of
                    Economic Affairs, and instituted a major overhaul of our aid policies. It
                    recruited some very able people to advise and run economic policy towards the
                    Third World. One thing that they decided very early on was that instead of
                    having aid programs in practically every Third World country in the world, they
                    would concentrate the bulk of foreign aid on a few countries promising good
                    economic management and rapid development. And whereas economic planning was a
                    dirty world in the Eisenhower Administration and particularly in the days of
                    Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey, economic planning became very much the key
                    criterion for selecting the countries on which our foreign aid was to focus.</p>
                <p>In Africa it was decided that Nigeria is going to be the great white hope. A
                    presidential commission of four members was formed of which I was a member. We
                    went to Nigeria for about month, visiting the capital and all then existing
                    three regions of the country, to see how far their economic planning had
                    progressed. The notion was that if we were satisfied with their economic
                    planning, then we would be ready to make a multi-year commitment of aid.</p>
                <p>A Ford Foundation team was assisting the Nigerian government in preparing a
                    multi-year economic plan, and the head of the team, Wolfgang Stolper, a
                    professor from the University of Wisconsin, was an old friend of mine. He told
                    me that doing economic planning in Nigeria was fascinating; when he gets back to
                    academia in the United States he planned to write a book to be titled, “Economic
                    Planning Without Statistics”. Our survey of the Nigerian economic scene made me
                    rather dubious about the necessity or desirability of making a long-term
                    commitment of aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt Tony to ask a question. Was Nigeria chosen
                        as the focus rather than other countries which might at that time seem to
                        have had more promise such as Ghana, which was under Nkrumah, or Kenya which
                        was under Jomo Kenyatta, two men with whom our policy was not always in
                        accord...did we choose Nigeria because it did not have strong
                        leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Nigeria had a very impressive leader, Prime Minister Abu Bakr, who was
                    murdered in cold blood shortly after we went there. He was very able and
                    dedicated to economic development. I am sure that our difficulties with Mr.
                    Nkrumah had something to do with it. I know much less about eastern Africa. But
                    Nigeria was the largest and most populous of the African nations, had many
                    economic resources even before oil production became one of its major economic
                    assets. It had a very respectable and capable civil service and some very good
                    economists and seemed stable politically at that time compared to other African
                    countries. All that added in favor of Nigeria being selected as the focus of our
                    aid efforts.</p>
                <p>Still, I felt that Nigeria faced many problems. At that time it was divided into
                    four provinces largely on tribal basis. There were great differences between the
                    regions, especially between the bustling capital city of Lagos and the
                    commercially advanced southern region and the sleepy, feudal north of Arabic
                    sheiks. Corruption was endemic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also differing on religion too, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. I had an uneasy feeling about political stability which was borne out
                    by subsequent events. But mostly I felt that a long term commitment was not
                    essential in supporting economic development. If any thing, our aid programs
                    were quite inflexible and aid receiving countries could generally count on the
                    aid levels remaining by and large unchanged year after year. On the other hand,
                    committing our aid to a certain level, and then not being able to fulfill the
                    commitments would bring frustration to both aid giving and aid receiving
                    parties. I was the sole dissenter on the team, we concluded that the economic
                    planning had not progressed sufficiently at the time of our visit, and the
                    decision on a multi-year commitment could be postponed. A second mission went to
                    Nigeria a few month later but by that time I had another assignment and I didn't
                    go on the second mission. I think that I wouldn't have been particularly welcome
                    with my views.</p>
                <p>I hate to say I told you so, but the second mission put its stamp of approval on
                    Nigeria and we made a long term commitment. For many years after our greatest
                    problem in Nigeria was how to get out of it. There was the Biafra war and we
                    were stuck with a long term commitment which for various reasons we were unable
                    to fulfill. It created mutual suspicions and recriminations.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>You asked about the Alliance for Progress. At the very beginning it was a very
                    desirable move on our part and I it was very much appreciated. Our problems with
                    Latin America is a long and historical story and the Alliance for Progress
                    eventually also lost its sheen because our always troubled relations with Latin
                    American countries. My exposure to Latin American economic issues was limited.
                    As I mentioned earlier, I had a hand in the preparations for the establishment
                    of a the regional development bank for Latin America. Tom Mann, who was
                    Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs and an expert on the region, asked me
                    to write a position paper on how this bank should be structured. I came to the
                    conclusion that it would be best if the bank would be limited to give hard
                    loans, that is on commercial terms similar to the World Bank, given the
                    relatively more advanced stage of development of most Latin American countries,
                    but that in order to satisfy Latin American sensitivities it should be located
                    in one of the Latin American countries. Tom Mann looked at the paper, gave me
                    high marks for it, but then he decided that the bank should give soft loans and
                    should be located in Washington.</p>
                <p>I had an encounter with Brazilian negotiators about economic aid to Brazil. They
                    were absolutely hep on macro economic planning, which is as I said before
                    absolutely anathema to Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey. We had some very
                    difficult sessions with the Brazilians. I finally was delegated to visit the
                    young Brazilian delegation in their hotel room and succeeded in persuading them
                    that asking the United States to fill their estimated capital gap of several
                    billion dollars is not going to get them anywhere. Instead they should submit
                    good economic projects and we would see what we could do for them. The amusing
                    thing was that when I finally made them understand how the American government
                    functions and what they can reasonably expect from us, they thanked me profusely
                    and said, “You must have a European background, we can understand you so much
                    better.”</p>
                <p>Incidentally, that happened to me in Indonesia too. One of my journalist friends,
                    Ed Korry (later our Ambassador to Ethiopia and Chile) recommended me to a young
                    Indian diplomat who was transferred from Paris to Indonesia. His name was Tony
                    Menezes, and he came from a good Catholic family in Bombay. He came to Indonesia
                    as an advance man to set up an Indian embassy in Jakarta. He called me shortly
                    after his arrival and we had lunch at a rather second rate hotel. He was most
                    miserable. He couldn't bring his young family to Indonesia because he couldn't
                    find any housing. He found dealing with the Indonesians extremely difficult. At
                    one point he turned to me and said, “You know, we Europeans dealing with these
                    Asians...” I looked around wondering who he had in mind, he was Indian and I was
                    American.</p>

                <p>Toward the end of my assignment in the Bureau of Economic Affairs I worked on the
                    establishment of the Development Assistance Group (DAG), the organization of
                    foreign aid donor countries set up at US initiative to coordinate the foreign
                    aid policies of those countries, but primarily to serve as a forum where member
                    countries would mutually encourage each other to increase their foreign
                    assistance and provide it on more favorable terms. In those days the US was
                    among the leaders in spending on foreign aid and we felt that time had come to
                    urge some of the European countries to share that burden more equitably. The
                    establishment of the DAG was part of the negotiations which replaced the
                    Organization of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) with the Organization of
                    Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OEEC was the institution of the
                    Marshall Plan which allocated the funds among its European member countries and
                    simultaneously liberalized trade and payments among them. By 1960 the US felt
                    that the OEEC fulfilled its mission. Trade liberalization among the countries of
                    Western Europe discriminated against outsiders, including the US This the US
                    supported during the period of economic rehabilitation of Europe. But by this
                    time the United States was getting concerned about its deteriorating balance of
                    payments. The OECD, which the US was prepared to join, was to become a
                    consultative forum for the industrial democracies to discuss and harmonize their
                    economic policies. Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand also became members.
                    The Development Assistance Group became the Development Assistance Committee
                    (DAC) of the OECD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words development replaced cooperation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: We promised to join the OECD on the basis that the new organization would
                    have different ground rules and different objectives. Among these new objectives
                    was the addition of consultations on development aid policies. We were thinking
                    initially of a small group of major donor countries, including the Germans,
                    French, British, the Japanese, possibly the Canadians, and ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be an inner circle of the OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>GEBER: Not really. Practically all of the OECD committees consisted of the full
                    membership. Later on the Executive Committee, which looked at issues before they
                    were sent to the Council and also had some management responsibilities, also had
                    a more limited grouping was of the more important members of the OECD where
                    senior policy officials of their member could discuss major policy questions.
                    For the DAC, and before it the DAG, we had in mind the major donor countries, as
                    I mentioned. But much to our consternation during the negotiations, lo and
                    behold the Portuguese insisted on joining as a major donor country and were
                    supported by the British representative who exclaimed “The more the merrier.”
                    Thereupon the Belgians also claimed to be major donors. Eventually most of the
                    OECD countries became members. The Japanese who were members of DAG from the
                    beginning, became members of DAC before becoming members of the OECD.</p>
                <p>The first meeting of the Development Assistance Group was held in Washington and
                    I was the secretary of the meeting. Mr. Dillon chaired the meeting. He was one
                    of the ablest public servants I had the privilege to work for, with an amazingly
                    rapid absorptive capacity. Let me tell you two stories to illustrate. In
                    preparation of DAG meeting I was asked to prepare a paper on burden sharing in
                    the economic aid field among the participants. There were a number of issues
                    which could be decided one way or another, e.g. should PL 480, US agricultural
                    surplus shipments to developing countries, carry the same weight as other forms
                    of assistance, etc. I submitted my paper to John Leddy, Mr. Dillon's special
                    assistant, on a Friday afternoon. Monday morning I got a corrected paper back
                    changing some of my figures. But the figures showing the aid amounts as a
                    percentage of GNP of the participating countries had the decimal points
                    misplaced. Thinking that John Leddy, with whom I was on very friendly terms,
                    made the mistake, I sent the paper back to him with an irreverent comment about
                    the dumb mistake. It turned out that Mr. Dillon went over all the figures in the
                    table I submitted, and it was he who misplaced the decimal points.</p>
                <p>My other story on Mr. Dillon occurred when he left the State Department and was
                    named Secretary of the Treasury by President Kennedy. The Treasury sent over to
                    State several big volumes of briefing papers which Mr. Dillon took home over a
                    weekend. On Monday he asked John Leddy to get some clarification on a rather
                    obscure point in one of the briefing papers. John tracked down the author and
                    told him that Mr. Dillon asked for clarification. The Treasury official did not
                    want to believe that the request came from Mr. Dillon nor even that Mr. Dillon
                    read the paper in the short time that he had it. When he was finally convinced,
                    his only reaction was: “Holy cow!”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Incidentally another person with such absorptive capacity was Ed Martin, at that
                    time the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs and my immediate boss on the
                    preparation of the DAG meeting. He and I were to meet with representatives of
                    the Embassies of participating countries for a briefing before the DAG meetings.
                    I prepared talking points for Mr. Martin but could not get to him before the
                    session and showed him the paper as we were rushing over to room where the
                    embassy representatives were assembled. He hurriedly glanced at the paper,
                    folded it as he sat down in the meeting and listed the eight or ten points in
                    the exact order I had in my paper. It is most rewarding to work for people like
                    Ed Martin.</p>
                <p>One of the issues that arose at this first meeting was how to distinguish between
                    export credits and economic aid. In those days, we were not only way ahead of
                    most other aid giving countries in terms of the resources we provided, but we
                    were generally in favor of untied aid. Export-Import bank loans which we counted
                    in our aid figures were by the charter of the bank tied to exports of American
                    machinery and services, but they were made for large scale projects usually on
                    repayment terms of fifteen years or longer. Much of the European aid figures
                    included export credits not related to projects and with much shorter repayment
                    terms. We wanted to make a distinction between the two types of financing and
                    give different weights to them in any burden sharing calculations. Harry
                    Rowntree, the chief economist of the Ex-Im Bank, was tasked to prepare a paper
                    defining the two financing mechanisms for consideration at the next DAG meeting.
                    Unfortunately the distinction between these two types, given the many
                    institutional and other differences among the member countries, was not as
                    simple as I just outlined. Weeks went by and there was no paper from Rowntree.
                    He apologized having been preoccupied with other problems. Finally he had to
                    admit that he found it very difficult to put his thoughts on paper. He said, “I
                    feel it in my bones what is a development aid and what is an export credit.” I
                    told him that unfortunately feeling it in his bones was not a good enough basis
                    on which to organize a discussion of the Group.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The next meeting was held in Bonn. It was held there because several members of
                    the Group were particularly interested in putting the pressure on the Germans to
                    mount a substantial aid program. Unfortunately, every member of the group was
                    quite aware of why we were in Bonn except the Germans. Things went very poorly
                    in the first few days of the meeting until finally Mr. Erhard, then the Economic
                    Minister, felt it necessary to come before the Group and give assurances that
                    the German government had every intention of raising the level of economic
                    assistance, only because they hadn't submitted their plans yet to parliament
                    were they unable to be more forthcoming in the meetings. That eased the tension
                    of the meeting. At the end of it the Germans delegation invited the American
                    delegation to a lovely dinner in one of their clubs. After dinner we adjourned
                    to one of the club rooms with comfortable leather chairs; excellent cognac and
                    cigars were served, Grady Upton, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and head of
                    the American delegation had a t�te-�-t�te with the head of the German
                    delegation, the Under Secretary in the German Foreign Ministry, soon to be named
                    Ambassador to the Vatican. (As was customary in many European countries, they
                    usually sent a Protestant as representative to the Holy See).I was invited to
                    join them in case they needed an interpreter. Mr. Upton in the spirit of
                    conciliation told his German counterpart that we all must make a greater effort
                    to assist the developing countries, although unless we find some solution to the
                    population problem in countries like India, for instance, much of the aid may be
                    money down the drain. To this the German gentleman replied, “Yes, Mr. Upton. I
                    see eye to eye with you. But we in Germany favor the Christian solution to
                    population control...wars, pestilence, floods.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your interesting time in the Department, it was off
                        to Paris and into the OECD for you, which seems to flow naturally from what
                        you have just been telling us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. Having become a development expert by then, and having worked on the
                    creation of DAG, my next assignment was to the OECD in Paris. I became the
                    development assistance advisor to our mission at the OECD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were programs coordinated among the donors and the
                        receivers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>GEBER: No, not really. DAC did not coordinate programs of donor countries in
                    individual developing countries. The Secretariat prepared information on the
                    direction of the donors' aid — by regions, I believe — but DAC's main
                    preoccupation remained the volume and terms of aid provided by its members.
                    Other topics discussed in DAC related to various aspects of the effectiveness of
                    aid. One of the most important activities of DAC was the periodic examination of
                    each member's aid policies. This was a procedure used in several other
                    committees of the OECD. The Secretariat prepared an analytical paper, in
                    consultation with the given member, on a its aid policies. On a set date the
                    member country made an oral presentation of its policies and the other members
                    were invited to comment and critique the policies; usually two or three member
                    delegations were designated as lead questioners. After such a meeting the
                    Secretariat revised its paper in light of the discussions and issued it in its
                    own name. It should not be surprising that the final paper could not include
                    criticism to which the member delegation strenuously objected; still it was a
                    reasonably objective evaluation, and whatever criticism the paper contained was
                    often welcomed by the responsible aid officials for strengthening their hand in
                    their internal battles.</p>
                <p>I must tell you an amusing story. It was the day of the examination of the French
                    aid program. The American delegation was designated as one of the lead
                    questioners. We prepared to be rather critical of French policies in the aid
                    field: the overwhelming portion of French aid was directed to the few
                    francophone countries of Africa; much of the aid consisted of the salaries of
                    French civil servants and teachers who, whatever good they did for those
                    countries, they also helped maintain the French infrastructure there.</p>
                <p>The French delegation was headed by Andr� deLattre, an Assistant Secretary in the
                    Ministry of Finance and an inspecteur des finances, that fabulous breed of
                    French civil servants, who, if they survived their elite and rigorous training,
                    excelled among their peers. M. deLattre made a brilliant presentation of the
                    French aid program, anticipating all critical questions, explaining as best he
                    could why things were as they were, and promising improvements in the future,
                    and all that in the most beautiful and articulate French. So, there was not much
                    point in asking the questions we had prepared, and Sy Rubin, the head of our
                    delegation, asked only why deLattre, explaining the constraints on the French
                    program, used repeatedly the English words, “pressure groups”. DeLattre replied
                    that if would have had to use a French expression he would have said,
                    “lobbies”.</p>
                <p>Sy Rubin, with the rank of Minister, was sent by the foreign aid administration
                    in Washington, which took over the backstopping of DAC from the State
                    Department. I served for a while on the delegation representing State but after
                    three years doing DAC work I switched to become trade advisor to our mission.
                    Not long after that change I was elected chairman of the Trade Committee Working
                    Party, a subordinate group of the OECD Trade Committee. The Trade Committee met
                    twice a year and its members were trade officials from the members' capitals,
                    whereas the Working Party was a standing committee, its members from the
                    resident delegations. Its function was to do the preparatory work for the Trade
                    Committee meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The main agenda of the Trade Committee and its Working Party in my time was two
                    fold. We were working on non-tariff barriers, such as government procurement
                    practices, customs nomenclature, border taxes, etc. with the objective of
                    setting forth guidelines to harmonize members' practices. The other part of the
                    Trade Committee's agenda was to try to coordinate the members' positions on
                    trade issues in relations to developing countries. This became increasingly
                    important after the developing countries, dissatisfied with their role in GATT,
                    created the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In the first
                    meeting of that organization in Geneva the developing countries took a highly
                    confrontational attitude toward the developed countries, and the latter found
                    themselves in considerable disarray.</p>
                <p>It was not easy to make progress in the Trade Committee, or generally in the
                    OECD. Two examples will illustrate. As I mentioned, eliminating or reducing
                    non-tariff barriers was one of the main topics discussed in the Trade Committee.
                    It was decided to attempt the formulation of a code or set of guidelines for
                    non-discriminatory government procurement practices, such as open bidding
                    procedures. It was not an easy task, most countries, including the United
                    States, having national laws and practices which they were reluctant to modify.
                    The Working Party had numerous meetings, and the Secretariat draft paper was
                    revised several times. Finally, it seemed there was general agreement, and prior
                    sounding suggested that at the next meeting of the Working Party the proposed
                    guidelines would be approved to be forwarded to the Trade Committee and from
                    there to the Council to be issued as an OECD Recommendation to the member
                    governments. At the meeting one representative after another approved the
                    document until we came to the delegate from Portugal who in a long statement
                    declared that his government could not approve the guidelines because there is a
                    great deal of difference between his centrally governed country and the
                    federally constituted United States; therefore these guidelines would have a
                    differential impact in the two countries. No pleading that at least he should
                    abstain, which would have allowed the application of the recommendations to the
                    other members, could persuade him to desist from his objection.</p>
                <p>The other illustration occurred in connection with coordinating OECD members'
                    positions on trade issues concerning developing countries. The question before
                    the Working Party was how should OECD members vote in UNCTAD on resolutions
                    pushed by the developing countries against which OECD members have objections;
                    it was understood that UNCTAD resolutions have no legally binding character. The
                    US representative argued that OECD members should stand on principle, and should
                    vote against resolutions to which they object. Other members were more inclined
                    not to aggravate unnecessarily the confrontation with the developing countries,
                    and go along or abstain on objectionable resolution. That point of view was most
                    concisely and perhaps somewhat cynically expressed by the French representative,
                    who very solemnly declared that the French government is prepared to support and
                    will abide by any UN resolution of which it approves.</p>

                <p>Still, one should not belittle the usefulness and accomplishments of the OECD.
                    For instance, on the question of granting preferential tariff treatment to
                    developing countries, one of the urgent demands of the Third World, the United
                    States found itself isolated in its opposition. It was in the OECD, in a four
                    member task force, that a scheme for a generalized system of preferences (GSP)
                    was worked out which made it possible for the United States to adopt such a
                    system. Similarly, a dispute between the US and the European maritime countries
                    over the rate setting in maritime trade was resolved in the OECD.</p>
                <p>More generally, the reviews of member countries' economicpolicies, and subsequent
                    publication of the findings, are acclaimed throughout the world by economists in
                    and out of governments. Many important studies, on fiscal policy, on labor, etc.
                    are useful to policy makers and academics. A development research institute,
                    initiated by the Kennedy administration, did excellent work and provided a
                    bridge between the OECD and developing countries. Every once in a while we got
                    together in the US mission to ask ourselves what we have accomplished. Very
                    often the feeling was, “not very much”. But when we looked back over a two or
                    three year period, we could see that whereas earlier there were issues which
                    countries considered their sovereign right and could not be subject for
                    discussion in a multilateral forum, they began to realize that an exchange of
                    views was in their interest. Just the fact that the OECD brings economic experts
                    and policy makers from capitals together has its value. I remember a story a
                    very distinguished pre-war president of the Hungarian National Bank, who later
                    was consultant to the German Bundesbank and the World Bank, told me. It was in
                    the 1930's, when all over the world trade barriers were raised, multiple
                    exchange systems were introduced, that a friend asked him what good it does to
                    attend the monthly meetings of central bankers at the Bank of International
                    Settlement, since the bank is completely ineffective and had no enforcement
                    powers. His answer was, that the fact that the central bankers had to look each
                    other in the eye every month prevented them from doing much worse. The OECD has
                    done better than that.</p>
                <p>Talking about a former Hungarian bank president, I have one other anecdote I
                    would like to tell. In preparation for an UNCTAD meeting the Trade Committee
                    tasked the Trade Committee Working Party to prepare a study of developing
                    countries' trade policies with a view to demonstrate that their generally
                    practiced protectionism and import substitution policies are hurting them as
                    much, if not more, than any trade policies of the industrialized countries. Such
                    a study would enable the OECD members to take a less defensive position in
                    UNCTAD.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>It was clear to me that the OECD Trade Committee Working Party was not qualified
                    to undertake such a study, even with the help of the Secretariat. I was greatly
                    relieved when I found out that the World Bank has engaged a small group of very
                    competent economists to undertake such a study. This I learned from the director
                    of the World Bank's Paris office who also told me that the head of the team will
                    be shortly coming to Paris. I thought that the best way the Working Party could
                    comply with the awkward mandate of the Trade Committee, is to invite the World
                    Bank representative and the distinguished economist charged with the study, have
                    them brief us on how they plan to proceed, and report that to the Trade
                    Committee. I tell this little story because at the meeting I as chairman,
                    flanked by the Paris office director of the World Bank (Mr. Arthur Karasz) and
                    the World Bank economist (Mr. B�la Balassa). We were sitting at the head of the
                    conference table and chatted in Hungarian.</p>

                <p>GEBER: Well, Hungarians were known as nuclear physicists and as orchestra

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask a question Tony? During your years there did you
                        notice a developing cooperation among the European countries because the
                        Common Market was beginning to gel at that time? Was there ever a tendency
                        for them to speak together or coordinate their policy ahead of time for
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: The European Community (EC) was represented by a separate delegation in
                    the OECD which functioned the same way as the country delegations. Furthermore,
                    at least before any major meeting, members of the EC held a coordinating
                    session. Member countries could still speak for themselves. While this
                    arrangement fostered the cohesion among the members of the EC, it allowed less
                    flexibility for its members to speak their own mind. Mind you, this was still in
                    the days when the EC consisted only of the original members of the Rome Treaty
                    and when de Gaulle did everything in his power to keep the British (and others)
                    out of the EC.</p>
                <p>One thing that I meant to mention, it was interesting to see the European
                    bureaucracies and how they differed. The French were absolutely magnificent.
                    They were self-assured, they could engage in discussions expressing their
                    personal views, they didn't have to have detailed instructions, etc. The Germans
                    were in the old European tradition mostly not economists but legally trained and
                    had to stick to the letter of their instructions. I think next to the French
                    some of the best people were the Dutch.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GEBER: I do not want to take away the great merit of such really farsighted
                    Frenchmen as M. Monnet and M. Schuman, but the beginnings of European
                    cooperation, the European Coal and Steel Community, has probably as much to do
                    with US and British policy in Germany, as with Mr. Schuman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GEBER: M. Schuman undoubtedly had the vision of Franco-German cooperation in the
                    post-war world, but I had some insight into workings of the French bureaucracy
                    to believe that it somewhat grudgingly accepted the European Coal and Steel
                    Community as a defensive measure. Realizing that dismantling in the Ruhr was
                    coming to an end around 1947 and that the British and US were willing to join
                    forces and build up the German coal and steel industry, the French decided that
                    they had better join the Coal and Steel Community. I suspect that they still had
                    in mind that thereby they can still control German steel capacity. The Maginot
                    line mentality disappeared only slowly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GEBER: We felt it much more personally in our private lives than in our official
                    life. I cited to you the statement made by the French representative on UNCTAD
                    resolutions. Generally, the French were no great believers in coordinating OECD
                    positions vis-a-vis the developing countries. All that had a de Gaullist flavor.
                    But on the whole they were quite cooperative in the OECD. It was an institution
                    to their liking and they were pleased to have it in their capital. Also quite a
                    few of the French officials who represented France in the various meetings and
                    in the Secretariat had friendly feelings toward the US Among them I would count
                    Ambassador Fran�ois Val�ry, the head of the French delegation to the OECD and
                    the son of the famous French poet, Paul Val�ry. It was a different story with
                    NATO which de Gaulle sent packing to Belgium.</p>

                <p>GEBER: After six years in Paris I got another hardship post, Vienna. People raise
                    their eyebrows when I claim that these were hardship posts, but think how much
                    cholesterol I consumed while I was eleven years in Europe six, in Paris and five
                    in Vienna.</p>
                <p>Shortly before I left Paris I learned that the position of economic counselor at
                    the Vienna Embassy was coming open and it wasn't too difficult to get the
                    assignment to Vienna. One of our good friends from Germany, James Riddleberger,
                    was ambassador in Vienna, who incidentally was the first DAG chairman in Paris
                    when I was there, and he was very pleased to welcome me to Vienna. The
                    assignment was as Economic and Commercial Counselor. Unfortunately, before I got
                    to Vienna, Mr. Riddleberger was replaced by Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II, who
                    had a reputation of being a difficult boss. In fact, in Paris I was surrounded
                    by people who worked for him at various posts, and some of them suggested that I
                    should try to get out of this assignment, but I shouldn't do anything overtly
                    about it because if I don't succeed, he would make my life miserable. They
                    figured that chances were that Ambassador MacArthur would select his own man for
                    the job. Well, I got the job and I got along quite well with him.</p>

                    not always easy to work for him but I seemed to have made a good impression on
                    him with the very first cable I drafted and, as I said, I got along quite well
                    with him. He and his wife were not particularly interested in the cultural and
                    artistic life, which was a handicap in Vienna, and USIS guys had to suffer from
                    it. But he took his political and economic tasks very seriously and he was also
                    very good at dealing with the American business community. He took a personal
                    interest in the activities of the American Chamber and met with them regularly
                    which they appreciated very much.</p>

                <p>GEBER: Let me say that Austria was a happy little island, stable and prosperous.
                    In 1968 there were huge demonstrations in the streets in Paris. Radical groups
                    disturbed the societies in Germany and Italy. Austria seemed to be immune to
                    these viruses. Oh, there were some student groups which staged a few
                    “happenings”, Chancellor Kreisky's son was one of the leaders. But whatever
                    demonstrations there were they were quite mild; when it rained the demonstrators
                    went home. Kreisky became chancellor about a year after I got to Austria. He was
                    in his prime one of the most astute statesman in Europe and was quite
                    influential beyond the borders of Austria. During my years in Vienna the big
                    issue was the American involvement in Vietnam. Kreisky and much of the Austrian
                    press and public was skeptical of the American policy there, if for no other
                    reason, because they feared, with some justification, that it distracts the US
                    from giving enough attention to Europe and that it judges relations with
                    countries primarily on the basis whether they support American policy in
                    Vietnam. Kreisky was not going to let Austria's good relations with the US fall
                    victim to the Vietnam problem. We also knew that he counseled moderation and
                    understanding for the US on Willy Brandt and Olaf Palme.</p>
                <p>Austrians were also among those who were still very grateful for the Marshall
                    Plan assistance and did not hesitate to say so often and publicly. They also
                    credited the US for their liberation from partial Soviet occupation, until 1989
                    the only instance where the Soviets relinquished territory they occupied. So,
                    all in all we had a very good relation with Austrians.</p>
                <p>For me personally it was particularly easy to be effective in my job. As I told
                    you at the beginning, I attended the two year course at the Konsularakademie in
                    Vienna as a young student. By the time I returned to Vienna some thirty years
                    later the building where I went to school and were I lived as a student became
                    the building of the American embassy. It was a very nice building, perhaps one
                    of the nicest embassy buildings we had anywhere in the world. It was built in
                    the neo-baroque style with an imposing staircase, large, airy rooms, high
                    ceilings. It was opened in 1904 by Emperor Francis Joseph, specifically as the
                    foreign service school for Austro-Hungarian diplomats, but the origins of the
                    school went back, as so many institutions of Austria, to Empress Maria Theresia
                    who ruled in the eighteenth century. Ambassador Humes, who succeeded Ambassador
                    MacArthur, occasionally introduced me to visitors to the embassy as the person
                    who had his bedroom as a student where his office is now. That was not quite
                    true but my obvious comeback to him was how does he know that I still don't have
                    my bedroom there?</p>
                <p>But, as I said, this background made my life very easy. When I arrived in Vienna
                    Kurt Waldheim was the Foreign Minister.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>GEBER: Well, school mate. He was a year behind me in school. He received me
                    rather graciously. Incidentally I must say that Kurt Waldheim was never a Nazi.
                    As I told you, I was in Vienna the day the Germans marched in in March 1938. The
                    day after we knew exactly who were the convinced Nazis. There were only a few
                    among my schoolmates, as there were also a few who heroically opposed them.
                    Quite a few disappeared from school because of their Jewish background. Most of
                    the students, as well as the professors, simply went along with events. I have
                    not the greatest admiration for Waldheim for various reasons, but the best
                    statement, in my judgement, about him and about his role as a junior army
                    officer in the Balkans was in a letter by a British journalist to the London
                    Economist, that his tragedy was that he neither had the skill nor the courage to
                    get out of a very difficult situation. Waldheim obviously skipped over his
                    service in the Balkans in his autobiography, presumably because he considered it
                    embarrassing. I visited Vienna after my retirement just about the time when he
                    was elected President of Austria, and some of my good friends, for whose
                    democratic convictions then and earlier I can vouch without any hesitation,
                    where distressed by the zeal of people in the American Justice Department which
                    led to Waldheim's banishment from visiting America. Nor should his election as
                    President of Austria be construed as a demonstration of pro-Nazi inclination of
                    the Austrian people. The election was fought on the basis of purely domestic
                    issues, and by then the Socialist party suffered several scandals and political
                    set-backs. Furthermore the Socialists put up as candidate a nonentity. In
                    contrast, Austrians viewed Waldheim, after his long tenure as Secretary General
                    of the UN, as perhaps the most prestigious Austrian diplomat since
                    Metternich.</p>
                <p>I had several other schoolmates in leading positions in government and in
                    industry, among them the ranking Under Secretary in the Ministry of Finance.
                    Although we had some battles with him, I always had easy access to him and that
                    helped, for instance, to overcome his objections to allowing one of the big
                    American insurance companies to do business in Austria.</p>
                <p>Our main problem in Austria in the economic-commercial field was that Austria had
                    the distinction of being the country where the United States had the lowest
                    market share compared to any other country where we maintained such market share
                    statistics; lower than in Germany, Italy or Switzerland, or for that matter
                    lower than in Ghana, India or Egypt. Many of the lessons about trade I learned
                    in Germany after the war I could experience in Austria. Germany had the
                    overwhelming market share of both Austrian exports and imports. The Austrian
                    spoke German and it was much easier for them to do business with Germany. But
                    that still did not explain why our market share in Switzerland was three times
                    higher than in Austria. We in the Embassy, from the ambassador down to our very
                    able local employees in the economic section, struggled valiantly to improve the
                    situation, but I must confess with little success. I came to the conclusion that
                    a good part of the difficulty rested with American business community, and that
                    export promotion should have focused as much on the American domestic scene than
                    on overseas. I will give you some examples which will illustrate the point.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Few days after I arrived in Vienna I heard the booming voice of Ambassador
                    MacArthur calling me to his office. The Austrian Minister of Trade, Mr.
                    Mitterer, came to complain to him that he acquired a Buick car as his official
                    car, and he went on an official trip to Yugoslavia. The Buick broke down on
                    route. His English was halting and that of his driver was nonexistent, and they
                    didn't have a German language manual for the car. I called the GM representative
                    in Vienna, who was a thick headed Dutchman, and I told him about the complaint.
                    He said to me on the telephone, “Well, why didn't the Minister ask for it?” I
                    said that if the Austrian Trade Minister acquires a car from General Motors, I
                    would have expected that he would be given a German language manual on a silver
                    platter. After this exchange we agreed to get together for lunch where he could
                    tell me his problems and I would tell him mine. It was quite an interesting
                    lunch. He told me that he was selling about 80 American made GM cars a year.
                    These were all luxury cars in Austrian eyes. They were big and gas guzzlers, and
                    had high duties, taxes and insurance premiums. Each were practically custom
                    built; one was green and convertible and had electric windows and the other
                    purple with different specifications. He could not even afford to stock spare
                    parts for this variety of cars in Austria. He did have a few ideas how sales
                    could be expanded in Austria which he submitted to his headquarters in New York.
                    The answers came back six months later saying that GM is selling 3 and a half
                    million cars in the US market and simply answering his letters is a cost
                    item.</p>
                <p>This was an extreme case in many respects, but not the only one.</p>
                <p>We were imposing some restrictions on Austrian textile exports and Secretary of
                    Commerce Stans came to explain our policy to the Austrians. The Austrians were
                    not at all pleased and suggested that instead of restricting their exports,
                    America should make a greater effort to export some of its good quality textiles
                    to Austria; there is a market for it.</p>
                <p>Just about that time the sales representative of Dan River Mills, a big American
                    textile company, came to the Embassy to tell us that he was quitting because the
                    supply from the United States was unreliable, it didn't come on time and
                    sometimes it didn't come at all. Dealing with the company was giving him ulcers.
                    Ambassador Humes was a friend of the President of Dan River Mills, and he wrote
                    him a letter in which he mentioned the Austrian reaction to the US restrictions
                    on textile exports and his firm's representative's complaint. The answer he got
                    back was exactly the reverse coin of what we heard from the Austrian side.
                    Austria is such a small market for us, wrote the president of the textile
                    company, that it is not worthwhile for us to exert ourselves with prompt filling
                    of orders.</p>

                        right except when he is too small.</hi>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>GEBER: Another example of the inadequate effort by American business, and this
                    time by a major multinational firm with sophisticated international experience,
                    was the loss of Westinghouse of the contract for the first Austrian nuclear
                    power plant to Siemens, the German competitor. The Austrians' main concern was
                    the safety of the plant to be built. During the long negotiations Westinghouse
                    sent each time a different team. We in the Embassy urged them to open a small
                    office in Vienna with a secretary and a telephone, so that the Austrian can feel
                    that they have Westinghouse sitting near their elbow; they refused to do so.
                    Toward the end of the negotiations the Austrians sent the bidding parties a
                    60-page, questionnaire which was to be answered in a limited period of time.
                    Shortly before the deadline I telephoned the Geneva office of Westinghouse to
                    inquire where they stand, The answer I got They “Gee whiz, it is 60 pages and it
                    is all in German!” The Germans won the bid. It can be only small consolation
                    that the plant had to be dismantled some years later after the Austrians voted
                    against nuclear power plants in a plebiscite.</p>
                <p>American trade promotion efforts also suffered from the way we administered
                    export controls. Although the Western allies coordinated export controls in an
                    organization called COCOM, the US maintained controls on items beyond those
                    agreed in COCOM. But it was not even so much the trade that we lost to our
                    competitors due to the differential controls that hurt us, but the inordinate
                    amount of time it took to come to a decision in Washington whether to issue or
                    deny an export permit. People in Commerce didn't seem to realize that if you
                    hold up licenses on strategically insignificant items, it shakes the confidence
                    of the importer in your reliability as a stable supplier and he will turn to
                    another source even for non-controlled exports. At one point while I was in
                    Vienna we had the visit of a high ranking official of Commerce to review our
                    trade promotion efforts. We decided to have him meet with a group of prominent
                    Austrian sales agents of American firms and general importers of American
                    products. First these were hesitant to speak up but once one of them started, it
                    was like a floodgate opened to their complaints. Most of it related to the
                    handling of export controls. The gentleman from Washington was overwhelmed by
                    what he heard.</p>
                <p>Export promotion was our major preoccupation. We also had some mutual complaints
                    on trade policies. The Austrians slapped a tariff surcharge on American oil cake
                    exports, an important cow fodder. Just about the same time we placed a quota on
                    Austrian cheese imports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cheese imports?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, cheese exports to the United States; Austrian made Swiss cheese. The
                    Austrians were very unhappy, particularly since the quotas were put on lower
                    quality and lower priced cheeses and did not affect their Swiss competitors. So
                    it was oil cakes versus cheese. The United States being a big country used its
                    muscle and the Austrians had to abolish their tariff surcharge on oil cakes. The
                    Austrians being a small country, they lost; the US was unwilling to change its
                    quota regulations. But in the end the Austrians won too. The Austrians upgraded
                    their cheese exports and ended up with exporting more in terms of value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask one question, Tony. Vienna was often seen in
                        those days as the show place for the Communist countries of Eastern
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: I was coming to that. Yes, Vienna was very much a listening post and an
                    outreach towards the Eastern European countries. Even with the Russians we had a
                    somewhat relaxed relationship. I knew my Russian counterpart and we could talk
                    quite civilly. After all the SALT I negotiations were held in Vienna and the
                    meetings alternated between our and the Soviet embassy buildings. Talking to the
                    East Europeans was even less inhibited. I recall a conversation at a monthly
                    get-together of commercial officers with my Hungarian and Israeli counterparts;
                    the lingua franca was Hungarian. Mr. Schmitz, the then president of the Austrian
                    National Bank was particularly anxious to cultivate the relationship with the
                    East Europeans. He organized various symposiums and seminars with the
                    participation of East European officials and economists. These meetings provided
                    useful and sometimes amusing insights into the thinking of the officials from
                    behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>At one of those Austrian National Bank sponsored symposiums, shortly after the
                    Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Czech participant was called upon
                    to report on economic conditions in his country. He admitted that conditions
                    were not good, that there were shortages of raw materials and that it was
                    difficult to maintain the morale of the workers because they often had to stand
                    idle next to their machines because of the lack of raw and intermediate
                    materials. An Austrian banker friend of mine, who told me the story, said that
                    at that point one of the Hungarian participants sitting next to him whispered in
                    his ear, “You see that is the problem. The government has lost confidence in the
                    people, the people should resign.”</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There were a number of anecdotes of that nature. I was at a delightful Austrian
                    institution, a yearly seminar that dates back to the early days of the
                    reestablishment of the Austrian Republic, the Alpbach Forum. Alpbach is a
                    lovely, picture book Tyrolian village where the Austrians from 1945 on, have
                    organized international gatherings of every type, economists, literary figures,
                    scientists, jazz musicians. The people who started this organization, several of
                    them resistance fighters and exiles, felt that Austria was so much cut off from
                    the cultural and political movements of the West during the Nazi period that
                    they felt the need of invite intellectual leaders from the West to exchange
                    ideas with their Austrian counterparts. Every year the program included an
                    economic symposium. I attended most years while stationed in Vienna. One of
                    those years, at a dinner hosted by President Schmitz of the Austrian National
                    Bank, I sat next to one of the vice presidents of the Hungarian National Bank.
                    The conversation started out by his saying that he had just come from Egypt.
                    This was at a time when Egypt was very much under Russian domination. I don't
                    think we had diplomatic relations with Egypt. He told me right off the bat that
                    he found that the most disliked people in Egypt were the Russians and the most
                    admired were the Americans. With that opening from a vice-president of the
                    National Bank of Hungary we could...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was an Hungarian communist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, indeed. He said some very interesting things. By that time, it must
                    have been 1970, Hungary has embarked on a course of economic reforms, away from
                    a rigid centrally planned economy. My dinner partner told me that the most
                    resistant to economic reforms were the old socialists. The Hungarian Workers
                    Party, as the ruling Communist Party was called, consisted of the Communists and
                    some of the Socialists who were forced to join the Communists in 1948, just like
                    the SED was formed in East Germany. These old Socialists, always somewhat unsure
                    of their standing in the party, were more afraid to depart from orthodox Marxist
                    dogma.</p>
                <p>I must tell you one more story. Again one of my Austrian friends told me that one
                    of the Hungarian economists, known as one of the leading Marxian theorists, told
                    him that “We Hungarians know what needs to be done. We have to get onto a
                    sensible pricing system based on market forces. We have to open our borders to
                    foreign trade so as to become competitive.” When my friend then asked him what
                    is then left of Communism and Marxism, the Hungarian answered, “Not very much.
                    Some social control of the means of production.”</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>GEBER: I must return to Alpbach because that was the scene of my greatest success
                    in Austria. In the summer of 1970 President Nixon announced a new economic
                    policy in the wake of the continuing deterioration of the US balance of
                    payments. Elements of the policy were the introduction of temporary price and
                    wage controls, a temporary imposition of import surcharges and a break with the
                    remnant of a gold standard, i.e. the lifting of the obligation to settle
                    official accounts with gold at the fixed rate of $35 for an ounce. The objective
                    was to realign the exchange rates between the dollar and other, mostly the
                    European currencies. As it happened, the economic symposium at Alpbach took
                    place that year about ten days after President Nixon's announcement. The
                    organizers of the symposium had the foresight to suggest as the topic of the
                    symposium something along the lines of “Inflation, exchange rates and the
                    balance of payments.” Given the timeliness of the topic, the symposium was
                    exceptionally well attended by leading officials and private sector figures. The
                    symposium was chaired by the president of the German Bundesbank. The American
                    discussants were three distinguished economists, professors Haberler and Machlup
                    and Henry Wallich, one of the governors of the Fed (who all spoke English with
                    different shades of a German accent). Most leading European bank presidents were
                    present. In fact, it was the first European gathering of important policy makers
                    and opinion shapers and the discussions were entirely focused on the
                    implications of the new American policies for Europe.</p>
                <p>The comments were rather critical, although somewhat self-righteous and
                    self-serving. But the importance of this meeting was that it was the first broad
                    based European reaction to the economic policies announced by Nixon.</p>
                <p>Austria was not the country, certainly not in my time there, from where embassy
                    reporting was eagerly read and awaited on the Seventh floor of the State
                    Department. My reports on the proceedings at Alpbach seem to have been the
                    exception. In fact we got a NIACT cable from the Under Secretary of Economic
                    Affairs, Mr. Samuels, that he would like to have urgently the transcriptions of
                    the discussions. (Because of the incompatibility of the Austrian and USIS tapes,
                    it took couple of weeks before the transcripts could be sent).</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Back at the Embassy in Vienna I told Ambassador Humes that my conclusion from the
                    Alpbach meeting was that if we insist on the policy which Secretary of the
                    Treasury Connally adamantly advocated, namely that all the exchange rate
                    adjustments between the dollar and European currencies should be done on the
                    European side, then we can expect at best a very limited adjustment. If, as I
                    believe we should aim for a major adjustment in order for the currency
                    realignment to be effective, then the dollar will also have to move downward
                    from the fictional parity of $35 to an ounce of gold. The argument that Mr.
                    Connally put forward, that we should protect the gold exchange standard, does
                    not seem very persuasive now that we have suspended our last link to it, the
                    obligation to settle official balances in gold at the $35 rate. It seemed to me
                    that by moving the dollar down and the European currencies up, we can have our
                    cake and eat it too. Ambassador Humes urged me to report my recommendations in a
                    cable to Washington. I was somewhat reluctant, figuring that such a
                    recommendation from Vienna would carry little weight since it was most likely
                    that the whole issue was under active consideration by high level policy makers
                    in Washington. In the end, I did do what the Ambassador suggested.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Ambassador Humes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. The cable went to Washington and we made some lateral distribution to
                    the major European posts. It so happened that Graham Martin, our ambassador in
                    Rome had as his house guest, Paul Volcker, Under Secretary of the Treasury for
                    International Affairs. Ambassador Martin showed him our cable and strongly
                    supported our recommendation. I cannot tell how much impact our recommendations
                    had, but the arrangement reached in December of that year in the so-called
                    Smithsonian Agreement was very much along the lines of our recommendations. It
                    was on the strength of my activities in connection of that Alpbach meeting that
                    Ambassador Humes recommended me for the Superior Honor award which I received
                    shortly after I returned to Washington in 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I certainly think you deserved your award and I
                        congratulate you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: I just want to point out that I could have spent five pleasant but routine
                    years in Vienna, if there would not have been the coincidence of President
                    Nixon's new economic policy, the Alpbach symposium, Ambassador Martin's support
                    of our recommendations and Mr. Volcker's stay in Rome at the Ambassador's
                    residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I partly agree that luck does play a role, but, after all,
                        if your cable hadn't been there they wouldn't have looked at it. But the
                        Department must have thought you needed some more education because I see
                        when you left Vienna you were sent back to the Senior Seminar.</hi>

                <p>GEBER: Either they thought that I needed more education or they didn't know what
                    to do with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had as most do, I gather, a profitable and enjoyable
                        year at the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. It was one of the great years I had in the Foreign Service. It was
                    tremendously instructive and enjoyable. One of the main purposes of the Senior
                    Seminar was, and I suppose still is, to reacquaint us with practically every
                    aspect of life in America. I must say that every moment I spent at the Seminar
                    was worth its weight in gold. Ambassador Sam Berger was the coordinator of the
                    Senior Seminar. He and his deputy, Bill Cunningham, arranged a most interesting
                    and varied program. We heard lectures by the Army Chief of Staff, by a member of
                    the Council of Economic Advisers, by Father Barone on the ethnic blue collar
                    middle class, by the head of Yale University's Physics Department, by a
                    Vice-President of the National Organization of Women (which made many of us
                    blush), by Antal Dorati, then the Music Director of the National Symphony, on
                    cultural exchanges, just to mention a few. On our field trips which took us to
                    practically every region of the country and to Puerto Rico, we visited the
                    nuclear submarine station in South Carolina, missile silos in North Dakota, we
                    rode in night patrol cars of the Chicago police, met with a group of young and
                    angry Chicanos in Denver, with UAW leaders in Detroit, visited plants of US
                    Steel and Kodak and booming foreign investments in Spartanburg, failed public
                    housing projects in Detroit and elsewhere, bootstrap efforts of community
                    leaders in the burnt out south side of Chicago, etc.,etc. The coordinators had
                    the amazing foresight to include meetings with the then Minority Leader of the
                    House of Representatives, whose name was Jerry Ford; the Governor of the State
                    of Georgia whose name was Jimmy Carter; and the Governor of the State of
                    California whose name was Ronald Reagan. So we had an insight into the
                    personalities of three of the succeeding Presidents. It was quite
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after that year you were assigned to the Department,
                        I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: It took a while, because despite the highest level assurances by the
                    management people in the Department that our placement from the Senior Seminar
                    will get the highest priority, none of us, with the exception of one, had a job
                    when we finished the course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a time honored tradition, Tony.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>GEBER: After trying to find an assignment on my own without much success, I
                    decided to stay home and wait for a call. That came after couple of weeks from
                    the Deputy Assistant Secretary in charge of economic matters in the Bureau of
                    East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Herman Barger, an old friend of mine. He wanted
                    to strengthen the economic resources of the Bureau and set up a small office for
                    Economic Policy. Herman asked me if I would be interested to be the Director of
                    the Office. The functions of the Office and its relations to the economic
                    officers on the country desks, as described by Barger, were somewhat vague, but
                    I accepted. Soon after it turned out that only Barger and the Assistant
                    Secretary designate, Mac Godley, favored the establishment of the office and
                    they failed to get the approval of Management. Furthermore, Godley's appointment
                    was disapproved by the Senate and Herman Barger retired a few weeks later. Art
                    Hummel, an outstanding China expert and a gentleman, became the acting Assistant
                    Secretary. He let me carry on despite his personal skepticism about the
                    desirability of the Office. But the Office was not officially established until
                    Bob Ingersoll, our Ambassador to Japan, became Assistant Secretary and he named
                    Les Edmond, another old friend of mine, to be his deputy for economic
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>The functions of the Office evolved gradually. There had to be some coordination
                    within the Bureau on foreign aid levels affecting several countries, on
                    commodity policies, such as rice, sugar, rubber, tin, on investment policy,
                    export promotion. The Office handled Bureau-wide contacts with the Bureau of
                    Economic Affairs, with the foreign aid agency, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture,
                    National Security people in the White House. We got involved in human rights
                    issues as they may have affected aid to East Asian countries. Congressional
                    testimonies and speeches for senior officials of the Department had to be
                    drafted. We attended meetings overseas of such regional organizations as the UN
                    Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Colombo Plan,
                    and the Asian Development Bank. Beginning with Phil Habib, Ingersoll's successor
                    as Assistant Secretary, I attended quite regularly the meetings of the Asian
                    Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce, since Phil thought it
                    important to maintain good contacts with the American business community in the
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oil policy must have played a role too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Oh yes, definitely. Shortly after I came on board in the East Asian
                    Bureau, in 1973, the first oil shock, engineered by the OPEC countries, impacted
                    on the world economy. Indonesia was a member of OPEC, Japan and Korea were major
                    consumers of oil relying on imports from the middle east.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>One of the major preoccupations of our Bureau was to square the need for
                    increasing oil supplies through the promotion of oil exploration with our policy
                    of discouraging exploration in disputed ocean waters. Given the geography of the
                    eastern rim of Asia, practically every square inch of the Pacific is disputed.
                    The problem was aggravated by the fact that mainland China and Vietnam, powers
                    not friendly to US interests, were among the claimants. The problem was never
                    satisfactorily resolved, except that as time went on shortage of oil supplies
                    became less of a problem.</p>
                <p>I think my most significant deed while I worked in the Bureau of East Asian
                    Affairs was the initiation of a “dialogue”, i.e. annual meetings between the US
                    and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Offhand I do not recall
                    when ASEAN was formed, but by 1974 it was an organization significant enough for
                    the European Community and Japan to hold regular economic consultations with it.
                    I thought that it was in the US interest not to lag far behind the Europeans and
                    the Japanese. As I indicated earlier, in those days relations between the Third
                    World and the industrialized democracies were quite confrontational, and the
                    more ideologically extreme countries among the developing countries could set
                    the agenda. Members of ASEAN, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
                    and Thailand (to which Brunei was added since), were among the more moderate
                    countries, which were paying more attention to their own interests than to
                    ideological confrontations. My superiors in the Bureau were somewhat reluctant
                    at first. The US was still deeply engaged in Vietnam, and some members of ASEAN
                    were not particularly helpful in supporting the US position.</p>
                <p>But finally Art Hummel, then Acting Assistant Secretary, agreed that we should
                    send out instructions to our Ambassadors in the ASEAN countries, to indicate to
                    them that the US would be receptive to an invitation by ASEAN for economic
                    consultations. A cable which I drafted went out on December 31, 1974 which also
                    contained an outline of the type of consultations we envisaged. In essence we
                    told the ASEAN countries, that they would be free to place any item on the
                    agenda, but we would wish to make trade and investment, rather than foreign aid,
                    to be the focus of the consultations.</p>
                <p>The timing of this initiative turned out to be unfortunate. We imposed some
                    sanctions on members of OPEC after the 1973 oil crisis. Indonesia was member of
                    OPEC and felt to be unjustly treated by these sanctions. By the time we resolved
                    our differences with Indonesia, South Vietnam, and with it the US position,
                    crumbled under the armed attack of North Vietnam. The ASEAN countries quite
                    understandably wished to wait and see what role the US planned to take in that
                    part of the world after our defeat before they responded to our offer of
                    consultations with them as a group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall there was also some antipathy in this country
                        to getting more deeply involved in Southeast Asia after having had our
                        fingers burned in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>GEBER: Yes, and we were concerned about the domino theory, namely that the defeat
                    of our policies in Vietnam may have adverse effect on the other Southeast Asian
                    countries. It was to counteract these concerns, both in the US and abroad that
                    President Ford made his famous speech in Honolulu in which he declared that the
                    US intends to maintain a strong presence in Asia. I had a hand in drafting the
                    economic part of the speech in which, I believe for the first time, the
                    President emphasized the importance for us of trade with Asia, stating that by
                    that time the volume of trade exceeded that with the European Community. That
                    was in 1975.</p>
                <p>At any rate the definitive and favorable response from ASEAN came only after
                    President Carter occupied the White House. The first US-ASEAN dialogue took
                    place in the Philippines in 1977. The US delegation was chaired by Under
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs, Dick Cooper, a brilliant economist and most
                    effective representative of the Department in the economic councils of the
                    administration. Foreign Minister Romulo of the Philippines, a great friend of
                    the US, chaired the ASEAN side. The meetings went quite well, the Filipinos were
                    gracious hosts. On the substantive side the major problem was something called
                    the Common Fund, of which the Malaysians among the ASEAN countries were the
                    strongest and most tenacious advocates, and which the US opposed.</p>
                <p>The Common Fund called for the pooling of several existing and to be established
                    commodity stabilization schemes to be supported by a sizable fund financed — as
                    the developing countries envisaged it — mainly by contributions from the
                    industrialized countries. The idea interestingly had its origins in a proposal
                    by John Maynard Keynes at the time of the Bretton Woods agreements. Remembering
                    the collapse of agricultural prices during the great depression, Keynes proposed
                    the creation of such a stabilization fund next to the monetary and trade
                    initiatives which resulted in the establishment of the IMF, the World Bank and
                    GATT. Raoul Prebisch the Latin American economist who became the first Secretary
                    of UNCTAD, picked up the idea, to be applied to commodities of major interest to
                    developing countries, e.g. coffee, cocoa, rubber, tin, possibly copper and
                    others. The US and most of the other industrialized countries were opposed to
                    the idea, for a number of reasons. For one, reason and experience have shown
                    that only few commodities lend themselves to be stabilized with such schemes.
                    Even in those the operation of the funds is very difficult; if the intervention
                    price is set too high, the demand for the respective commodity may well be
                    replaced with substitute materials, if set too low, the fund may run out of
                    money. Furthermore, there were existing and better mechanisms in place in the
                    IMF, to compensate developing countries dependent on exports of one or two
                    commodities for shortfall of revenues due to temporary decline in prices.
                    Unfortunately the position of the industrialized countries was weekend by the
                    French among them, who were strong advocates of commodity stabilization schemes,
                    and therefore of the Common Fund, and by the fact that many of the
                    industrialized countries had price support schemes for their agricultural
                    products. That much of the burden for the Common Fund would fall on the
                    industrialized countries, either by paying high prices for their tropical
                    commodity imports or by continuous replenishing of the Fund, did not escape the
                    attention of the developing countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The Manila meeting provided an opportunity to explain in detail the US position
                    to ASEAN but did not change the respective positions on this issue. The US
                    accepted requests for some aid, primarily for some feasibility studies in the
                    energy field. The only slightly sour note that emerged came from some ASEAN
                    circles after the meeting, that the US was represented only by an Under
                    Secretary, whereas ASEAN sent several Ministers to the meeting. I thought that
                    this was regrettable because few people could have represented the US more
                    authoritatively and more knowledgeably on the subject matters discussed than
                    Dick Cooper. It reminded me of somebody's facetious suggestion, that the US
                    needs two Secretaries of State, one who constantly travels to meetings and an
                    other who does the work at home.</p>
                <p>The second meeting took place in Washington in 1978 and I was again coordinator
                    of that meeting. 14 ASEAN Ministers came to the meeting. Foreign Minister Romulo
                    again chaired the ASEAN delegation. On the US side five Cabinet members
                    participated, Mr. Vance chairing the US delegation. The ASEAN Ministers were
                    also received by President Carter.</p>
                <p>Let me first entertain you with some of the peripheral crises surrounding the
                    meeting, because, though amusing in retrospect, they are also instructive.</p>
                <p>It was standard practice in these ASEAN consultations that the host delegation
                    offered a dinner on the first night of the meeting and the visiting delegation
                    reciprocated on the second night. For the dinner given by Mr. Vance we invited a
                    number of leading figures from the private sector, for instance, George Meany,
                    the president of the AFL-CIO. In addition, Secretary of the Treasury, Michael
                    Blumenthal, was to host a smaller lunch. Shortly before the meeting was to open
                    I discovered that the office in charge of the logistical support for conferences
                    forgot to budget for these events. We scrounged around for money but with not
                    much success. I sat with Dick Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary, late one
                    evening. He suggested that perhaps we could disinvite the lower ranking members
                    of the ASEAN delegation. (My answer was: No). Could we skip the soup course?
                    (Perhaps). In the end we had the dinner and the lunch, even including soup. But
                    it confirmed my view, not for the first time, that Henri Kissinger was right
                    when he said that when it comes to official entertaining and gift giving the US
                    ranks behind the least developed countries.</p>
                <p>A day or so before the event Madam Ambassador Rosario of the Philippines, my
                    ASEAN counterpart, came to my office, and rolling her eyes toward heaven told me
                    that something terrible has happened. I was fearing the worst, but she told me
                    that Mrs. Imelda Marcos, the wife of the Philippine President, was put on the
                    Philippine delegation. Ambassador Rosario was not quite sure at that point
                    whether Mrs. Marcos would replace Mr. Romulo as chairman of the ASEAN
                    delegation. I assured her in my best diplomatic manner that we will welcome her
                    and make her presence agreeable and useful, thinking all the while to myself
                    that, thank goodness, this is your problem not mine. As it turned out, Mrs.
                    Marcos attended most of the social events connected with the meeting and spent
                    the rest of the time in New York, doing some shopping.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>One item on the agenda, placed there at the request of the US, was a discussion
                    of the refugee problem in Southeast Asia. I reminded Bob Oakley, one of our
                    Deputy Assistant Secretaries, that the way we planned our participation in the
                    meetings, namely that for each agenda item the principal official responsible
                    for that topic would lead the discussion on the US side, it would mean that Ms.
                    Pat Derian, the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights would be our spokesperson.
                    As it happened, Ms. Derian returned recently from a trip to countries of
                    Southeast Asia, during which, to put it mildly, she made herself thoroughly
                    disliked by many of the heads of governments, including Lee Kuan Yew of
                    Singapore, whom she visited. Oakley told me he will take care of the problem.
                    Well, he didn't. The evening before the opening, the American Chamber of
                    Commerce and the Commerce Department jointly gave a reception. There we learned
                    that Mr. Romulo was going to walk out of the conference room and take all the
                    ASEAN Ministers with him if Ms. Derian would speak to the topic on the American
                    side. If that would have happened, it would have dominated the media coverage of
                    the meeting. Again, it was late in the evening when we sat with Mr. Vance to see
                    what could be done to prevent a walk out by the ASEAN Ministers. Mr. Vance
                    decided that he will be the spokesman of the American delegation for that agenda
                    item. I was tasked to see to it that Ms. Derian does not sit in the front row of
                    the American delegation.</p>
                <p>The meeting with President Carter was set for noon on the second day of the
                    meeting. The ASEAN Ministers were to ride over in a cavalcade from the State
                    Department to the White House. Knowing how difficult it is to get into the White
                    House, I made fail-safe arrangement that I will get there at the head of the
                    column and, giving my name, will vouch for the occupants of the cars behind me;
                    should anything happen to me, my deputy, Rob Warne, would do it for me. We
                    arrived at the west gate of the White House, the heavy iron gate was half open.
                    A security agent came out to the car and I gave my name and showed my
                    identification card. He walked back to the guard house and came out again and
                    then walked back to the guard house, whereupon the open half of the gate was
                    closed. It turned out that due to my precautionary arrangement, they only had
                    Warne's name and not mine, and Warne was nowhere to be seen. Finally, he arrived
                    in a taxi all out of breath to rescue us; he was held up by an irate telephone
                    call from the Chairman of the Asia subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, that he was not invited to the meeting in the White House.</p>
                <p>In the morning we had a call from Mrs. Marcos that she wants to participate in
                    the meeting with the President and wants to bring four military aids with her. I
                    called her back on instructions that she is most welcome to attend the meeting
                    but because the Cabinet Room in the White House has limited space she should
                    leave the military aids behind. When the participants left the State Department
                    for the White House, Mrs. Marcos was not there. President Carter entered the
                    Cabinet Room shortly after our arrival, went around the room greeting the
                    Ministers and providing photo opportunities. He finally took his seat and opened
                    the meeting. At that moment the door to the Cabinet Room flung open and Mrs.
                    Marcos entered in a bright red suit — with one military aid. Nobody could have
                    staged a more theatrical entrance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It couldn't have been planned better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: As to the substance of the meeting, everything went very well. It was a
                    useful exchange of views on many subjects of mutual interest. The ASEAN
                    delegation seemed to be favorably impressed by the high level attention they
                    received and the competent presentation of US approaches to the several issues
                    discussed. They said so in their remarks at the dinner they gave at the
                    conclusion of the meeting. The major unresolved issue was still the Common Fund
                    but Mr. Vance defused the controversy by personally stating that he understood
                    the importance ASEAN attached to the instability of commodity prices, and he
                    promised that the US would again take a hard look at the problem.</p>
                <p>That meeting was my last activity in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, and
                    although I have not followed closely what happened subsequently in the US-ASEAN
                    dialogue, I feel some satisfaction that our relations with ASEAN are deemed
                    important enough that the Secretary travels once a year for consultations when
                    ASEAN holds its summit meetings.</p>
                <p>My next assignment was as Economic and Commercial Counselor to Korea.</p>

                        following East Asian affairs very closely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: I was asked to take that job by our Ambassador to Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Dick Sneider?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: No, it was Bill Gleysteen who had just gone to Korea after being the
                    Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs. I only
                    stayed in Korea for one year. The mandatory retirement age of 60 for Foreign
                    Service officers was suspended at that time but the issue was before the courts.
                    I was 59 and a half years old when I went and I and my wife were reluctant to go
                    unless we could stay for at least a two year term of duty. I received assurances
                    from personnel, but not in writing. The Supreme Court reinstated the 60 year
                    retirement age four days after my 60th birthday. The Department let me stay for
                    another six months but no longer.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>From a professional point of view Korea was one of the most fascinating places.
                    The Korean economy was booming. Korea was becoming one of the most important
                    trading partners of the US. Korean businessmen were flitting around the globe,
                    to the US, to Europe, Africa, Latin America, making deals. The economic team
                    which managed the economy was most impressive. The government still had a very
                    intrusive role in the economy. The President received daily reports and held
                    monthly meetings on the export performance of the Korean economy. The labor
                    force was highly disciplined and hard working. Education was the obsession of
                    that Confucian society. A great deal of attention was given to an equitable
                    income distribution with reasonable success. At least ostentatious living was
                    discouraged from the top. But what impressed me most was the “can do” spirit of
                    the Korean entrepreneurs. Industrial parks were being built on a scale I have
                    not seen in America or Europe. There was no hesitation to plunge into the
                    development and manufacturing of the most sophisticated technologies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They learned how to make automobiles at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GEBER: Yes. There were three or four companies, including a joint venture with
                    General Motors. A few years later Hyundai cars invaded the American market with
                    an unprecedented initial success. Color TV set manufacturing started in the late
                    70's and output doubled and trebled each year, despite the fact that their sale
                    was not permitted in the home market.</p>
                <p>There were strains to be noted. The economy was getting too big for the kind of
                    centralized management and planning, and plans were made to decentralize
                    economic decision making. The organization of the financial markets lagged
                    behind the manufacturing sector. The export-led growth strategy produced some
                    strong protectionist pressures despite the better judgment of some of the
                    principal economic planners. Most importantly, the economy became overheated
                    during my year in Korea and when the brakes had to be applied, the economy had
                    to pay a heavy price. Companies went bankrupt, some of those gigantic
                    manufacturing projects had to be abandoned and the growth rate declined. The
                    growing middle class was becoming increasingly restless. President Park Chung
                    Hee was able to maintain his politically repressive regime as long as he could
                    post economic successes, but paid with his life when the county's economic
                    fortune declined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that market open to American products, or was that
                        part of your job to pry it open?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>GEBER: As I said, there were strong protectionist pressures still at work in the
                    Korean economy, and sometimes we had some difficulties on that score. But we
                    also had some strong cards we could play. After all, we were the security
                    guarantor of Korea, and we could put political pressure on the Koreans. That was
                    the case with Westinghouse's bid on one of the nuclear power plants then under
                    negotiation, against strong French and German competition. We urged President
                    Carter to raise that issue during his state visit to Korea, and the Koreans gave
                    us a nice Fourth of July present by informing us on that day that they awarded
                    the contract to Westinghouse. Similarly, we won a major telecommunications
                    contract when we gently twisted the arm of the Koreans.</p>
                <p>Another advantage we had was that the Korean government was anxious to shift
                    procurement from Japan, with which they had a chronic trade deficit, to American
                    suppliers. Unfortunately, there we were less successful, mostly because American
                    suppliers were unable or unwilling to fulfill Korean requirements. The first
                    request was for diesel engine automobiles to replace the Seoul taxi fleet in
                    light of Korea's great dependence on imported oil. Instead of 200, GM offered 3
                    diesel engine Oldsmobile cars; perhaps just as well, since they turned out to be
                    lemons. When we learned that the GM and Daewoo joint venture car manufacturing
                    was greatly expanding capacity, and that they have ordered machinery from Japan,
                    we asked and have gotten a request for a second and even a larger order. A
                    speedy request through the Commerce Department to GM and their suppliers
                    remained unanswered. It was a boom period for the US car manufacturers and the
                    suppliers of machinery were unwilling either to divert some to Korea or to
                    expand their production. The same happened on a long list of chemicals the
                    Koreans wished to buy from the US, despite Korean assurances that they would be
                    willing to enter into long-term supply contracts, and the American suppliers
                    could ship these products when domestic demand cooled off. And so it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Discouraging, stories like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>GEBER: I must tell you one more of my activities in Korea which bore fruit about
                    10 years later. Shortly after I arrived in Korea I noted that the Koreans,
                    despite their great economic achievements, felt isolated and lacked an
                    appropriate multilateral economic forum in which they could effectively
                    participate. With their growth rates they were talking about being soon eligible
                    to become members of the OECD. I did not think that even if the OECD would be
                    willing to expand its membership, that that would be the right solution. With my
                    experience in East Asian affairs and in the OECD, I thought that time has come
                    to organize a consultative economic organization for countries of the Pacific
                    rim. I had in mind a greatly scaled down OECD, concentrating on regular review
                    of members' economic policies, including trade, with such additional projects
                    which members would be willing to approve from time to time. It should be an
                    intergovernmental organization, with a small permanent secretariat. I was aware
                    of the reluctance of the bureaucracies, particularly the American, to
                    contemplate yet another international organization. I also knew that while our
                    officials were quite willing to fly 7 hours to Paris, they had a great aversion
                    to flying 20 hours across the Pacific. Still, I thought that given the growing
                    importance of the Pacific region, time has come for such an organization and the
                    burden on officialdom could be reduced by phasing out some existing
                    organizations which were no longer very useful, e.g. Colombo Plan, and
                    consolidate our many commitment to other multilateral and bilateral
                    consultations in the region. I sent a cable from Korea outlining this proposal.
                    Unfortunately I explained my ideas orally earlier to one of our backstoppers in
                    Washington, on his visit to Seoul. whose name I prefer not to divulge, He
                    sabotaged my recommendations by suggesting that the consultations be only among
                    entities of the private sector, such as academics and research organizations.
                    Much as that was useful, it was no substitute for the participation of
                    government policy makers. Gradually the desirability of government involvement
                    became recognized. About three years ago the Asian Pacific Economic Council
                    (APEC) was formed and President Carter convened a summit meeting of the Council
                    in Seattle last year. I attended a briefing session organized by the Asia
                    Society by those closely involved in the preparations for the Seattle meeting,
                    and was pleasantly surprised how far my recommendations of fifteen years earlier
                    have matured. But I was perhaps the only one in the room with the institutional
                    memory who remembered that about 40 years earlier President Eisenhower and
                    Secretary Dulles traveled to Seattle to be hosts of a Colombo Plan meeting. I
                    wish the new organization greater achievements and longer durability.</p>

                <p>GEBER: That is right. I retired from Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you Tony. Do you have any final thoughts
                        before we close the tape? Did you find your career in the Foreign Service
                        rewarding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>GEBER: I look back on my career in the Foreign Service with a great deal of
                    satisfaction. The jobs I had were rewarding, and whatever little knowledge and
                    talent I had I could fully employ in the service of my country. I found my
                    bosses in the various assignments, perhaps with one or two exceptions, highly
                    competent and dedicated, and what is perhaps more important, they were satisfied
                    with me. I made many friends in the Service which will last until they and I
                    live.</p>
                <p>I think the Foreign Service has and is doing a great job. I wish that the
                    American public would recognize it more. The popular notion that we are striped
                    pants cookie pushers is mistaken. Many of our people have sacrificed a great
                    deal, some even their lives.</p>
                <p>American foreign policy on the whole has been quite successful, particularly in
                    the days after World War II, when we were on the top of the world. Our policies
                    were farsighted and generous. I doubt that other countries ever matched that
                    record. It is somewhat more difficult to find our bearings now when we achieved
                    our main objectives, the economic prosperity of our allies and our adversaries
                    in that war, the rapid growth of many of the developing nations, and the
