                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Hendrik Van Oss, a retired
                        Foreign Service Officer, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Oral History
                        Program. Mr. Van Oss can you tell us something about your background before
                        you entered the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I was born July 26, 1917 in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania and shortly
                    afterwards moved to Plainfield, New Jersey where I spent most of my childhood
                    and high school days, except for an interlude of five years when my father was
                    employed by Unilever Brothers in The Hague, Holland. We all went to Holland and
                    I went to my first five years of grammar school in The Hague. We returned to the
                    States in 1928 because my father was a naturalized citizen of Dutch origin and
                    was in danger of losing his citizenship because he had been abroad five years.
                    So I spent my early education other than Holland in Plainfield, New Jersey.</p>
                <p>After graduating from Plainfield High School (1934), I went to Mercersburg
                    Academy for one year and then to Princeton University, from which I graduated in
                    1939. I had a couple of years at Columbia University in the Law School.</p>
                <p>The war was looming and the draft was approaching and I felt this was not the
                    time to be studying law or anything else so I took leave of absence from
                    Columbia Law School, got a temporary job with W.R. Grace &amp; Company in New
                    York and looked for work connected with the war effort in Washington. I might
                    add that I was called up for the draft but turned down because I was too
                    nearsighted.</p>
                <p>I entered the State Department in June of 1942 in the Division of World Trade and
                    Intelligence (WT), (a regular State Department division, not part of OSS). It
                    had to do with the proclaimed list of block nationals. While in WT, I shifted
                    from economic warfare work to biographic informational work and helped set up
                    the State Department's unit for collecting biographic information on important
                    world figures. We eventually absorbed OSS's biographic record section and became
                    a full fledged Division. I eventually (1944 or '45) became acting chief of
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I took the written Foreign Service exam in early 1945, the first given after
                    World War II, passed the orals and was appointed, at least nominally, in
                    September, 1945, I believe. I did not actually enter the Service as such until
                    1948 because I had to carry on with biographic work until a successor could be
                    found.</p>
                <p>I was married in 1947 to Anne Burnett, a Louisville, Kentucky belle. Our first
                    post abroad was Shanghai where we arrived in 1948. I served in several posts in
                    Southeast Asia (Saigon and Kuala Lumpur) then went to Vienna for three years and
                    then back to Washington in the Department's Division of Civil Aviation. After
                    this, in 1959, I went to Johns Hopkins' School for Advanced International
                    Studies (SAIS) for a year of African area training and then was assigned to
                    Kampala, Uganda as Consul General. I had several African posts, and was Country
                    Director for Central West African Affairs in Washington for a while. Then I had
                    a year at the Senior Seminar. After that (1965) I went to Wellington, New
                    Zealand as deputy chief of mission and later (1971) to Lourenco Marques,
                    Mozambique as Consul General. I retired from the Foreign Service in
                    mid-1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Lourenco Marques was your last post and you were Consul
                        General there from 1971- 74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is right. That was my swan song.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Lourenco Marques at the beginning of the
                        end, as it were, of the Portuguese colonialism there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, although I don't think any of us thought of it as the beginning of
                    the end, although in retrospect probably we should have. But when I first got
                    there the Portuguese were very firmly in control. The war against Frelimo, the
                    liberation movement, was going quite well for the Portuguese. They had a very
                    dynamic commander-in-chief, General Kaulza de Arriaga, who was quite an
                    interesting and forceful figure. His detractors dubbed him “The Pink
                    Panther.”</p>
                <p>At the time I arrived, the liberation movement, Frelimo, was pretty well confined
                    to the northernmost portion of Mozambique. It made claims, of course, to
                    controlling from thirty to fifty percent of the entire country, but so far as I
                    could determine that wasn't the case. Their only area of actual control was in
                    the northern part, the part that coincided more or less with the area inhabited
                    by the Makonde tribe, just south of the Ruvuma River which forms the border
                    between Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>
                <p>The Makonde are a very aggressive, talented people who spill over from southern
                    Tanzania into northern Mozambique. Frelimo had the support of, and derived much
                    of its power from the Makonde.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>It was not until about mid or perhaps early 1973 that it began to become evident
                    something was going to change. I think we were too close to events to see them
                    clearly at the time, but that is when the beginning of the end for the
                    Portuguese became more evident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1971 how did the Department prepare you for this
                        post? They apparently did not see the revolution taking off then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Speaking of the revolution in Portugal or in Mozambique?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mozambique.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: The actual preparation I had for Mozambique was twenty weeks of
                    Portuguese language training at FSI and, of course, the usual briefings. The
                    Department was a “two-headed monster,” if you want to call it that. Portugal was
                    an ally and member of NATO. Portugal, also, was the last remaining colonial
                    power in Africa, unless you consider the governments of Rhodesia and South
                    Africa as colonial. Portugal, the colonial power and our NATO ally, was
                    important in the eyes of the European Bureau of the Department. But Mozambique,
                    as an African country, was under the aegis of the Department's African Bureau,
                    which was interested in the liberation and independence of all African
                    countries. The Department's two Bureaus were unified in wanting to put pressure
                    on Portugal to voluntarily give Mozambique its independence, but differed in
                    timing and in how much pressure to apply.</p>
                <p>But there were various other currents that I was being prepared for. One was, of
                    course, Rhodesia which was ruled by a government of white settlers who had taken
                    over from the British and issued a unilateral declaration of independence or
                    UDI. The Department (and the British) were very much opposed to the act, and
                    didn't recognize the UDI Rhodesian government. I was under instructions not to
                    do anything in Mozambique that would imply in any way that the U.S. recognized
                    the UDI government. That led to some interesting developments which I will go
                    into later.</p>
                <p>Of course, the African Bureau was very much in favor of Frelimo and was trying to
                    indicate that we supported it at least in theory without offending the
                    Portuguese whom we depended on for bases and landing rights in the Azores and
                    support in various other affairs. You recall that during the Israeli wars the
                    Portuguese gave us landing rights in the Azores and thus helped us supply the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So there I was, I had two masters. I was in a Portuguese territory and therefore
                    owed a slight bit of fealty to the European Portuguese Desk and the American
                    Ambassador in Lisbon; but as an African specialist I felt I owed primary loyalty
                    to the Bureau of African Affairs. When I arrived in Mozambique I found that
                    practically all my contacts were either with Portuguese officials or with
                    Mozambiqicans who were loyal to Portugal and used by the Portuguese to show how
                    liberal and multi-racial they were. So all my sources of information on the spot
                    were inspired or controlled in one way or another by the Portuguese. That
                    doesn't mean that I didn't also have black and white contacts who were
                    anti-Portuguese. But the ones who knew what was going on in the battlegrounds
                    and in the bush where the fighting was going on were mainly Portuguese
                    officials.</p>
                <p>As a loyal and experienced Foreign Service officer I reported what I heard. I
                    called the shots as I saw them and tried to be as critical as possible. But I
                    had these restrictions of having to be careful about Rhodesia and walking a very
                    narrow path between the Portuguese and the Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1971 after you arrived I think the only news report I
                        saw that struck my eye said Hastings Banda visited Mozambique. Was that of
                        any significance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, the Banda visit was not of all that great importance to me at the
                    time, but it was significant to this extent: Hastings Banda was one of the few
                    African leaders who got along with the Portuguese. In fact, his honorary consul
                    in Mozambique was a man named Jorge Jardim, a prominent, wealthy Portuguese
                    businessman. Jardim was really a very interesting person. For example, he
                    started parachute jumping at the age of fifty. He was a man's man, very
                    conservative and influential. He had very good relations with Africans and,
                    holding the title of Honorary Consul for Malawi, he was Hastings Banda's man in
                    Mozambique. So the visit of Hastings Banda is significant from that point of
                    view. Also, Mozambique's main importance in Africa at that time was as a passage
                    way for goods going to and from Rhodesia, South Africa and Malawi, which is land
                    bound. Nacala, in the northern part of Mozambique, is a potentially very fine,
                    deep water port. It was slated to become Malawi's access to the ocean. Although
                    Nacala stayed within Mozambique's sovereignty, Malawi was to be allowed to have
                    almost total use of it.</p>
                <p>Thus, the Portuguese made a great fuss over Banda but the episode was not all
                    that important. I don't remember much about it now, that is the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1972 things continued about the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. I did quite a bit of travelings throughout Mozambique, mostly as a
                    result of Portuguese invitations. General Kaulza de Arriaga knew on which side
                    of the street the sun shone and did his best to keep American representatives
                    briefed. He told us what he wanted us to hear, of course, but through him and
                    through his deputies I was...I actually did this myself, able to arrange for all
                    of us in the Consular Corps to get regular briefings by the Portuguese military
                    authorities. We went over to their headquarters about once every two weeks. We
                    were constantly being invited to go with Kaulza on trips to the north or to the
                    central portion of the country. These trips allowed me to see quite a bit of
                    what was going on.</p>
                <p>I can say this, to give just a small tip of the hat to Kaulza, he had trained his
                    men well, had built up their morale. The Portuguese fighting forces were strong
                    and effective. They were not sissies in any sense of the word. Their parachute
                    jumpers were highly trained and included a great number of black troops. At one
                    point later in my tour of duty Kaulza came into ill repute and was fired in
                    effect; I can go into that in greater detail later if you are interested. But
                    once he left, the whole situation changed. Portuguese morale was no longer as
                    high as before and Kaulza's successor was a nonentity whose name I can't even
                    remember now and who was dubbed by Portuguese critics as the “unknown soldier.”
                    He was mainly an administrator and ineffective as a leader in battle. At that
                    point the end of Portuguese rule surely should have been in sight for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time, the end of 1972 and beginning of 1973, a lot
                        of other countries, Denmark, Brazil, etc. had all announced support for
                        Frelimo and were sending them money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: This was going on all through my assignment. The Scandinavian countries,
                    in particular, were giving Frelimo support and we were too. Not military
                    support, but we were giving them humanitarian support. The first chief of
                    Frelimo, Edwardo Monlane, was American trained. He had an American wife, a white
                    woman, and was highly regarded by Western countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was he trained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think Syracuse University but I would have to check on that. He was
                    long dead before I got to Mozambique. Samora Machel was head of Frelimo in my
                    time. Going back a bit to the sources I had, I have frequently been asked why I
                    didn't have any contacts with Frelimo. The reason was that they weren't there.
                    They weren't to be found in any place I was. Later I learned that one of the
                    young black up-and-coming bank assistants we used to know and have lunch with
                    occasionally was, indeed, a hidden member of Frelimo. He eventually became, I
                    think, Minister of Economic Affairs or some comparable job after Frelimo took
                    over the reins. Graca was his first name.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that period then, 1971-72, Frelimo personnel were not
                        in evidence in Lourenco Marques at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, no. Not only that, if anybody had presented himself to me personally
                    as a Frelimo, I would have had to be very careful because the Portuguese had a
                    very, very thorough Secret Security Office, the DGS, and there was always the
                    possibility that they were trying to test me to see whether I was doing
                    something that was not allowed. That wouldn't have kept me from talking with
                    somebody if I had known that that person was in truth a member of Frelimo. But
                    if he had sort of sneaked up to me on the street, he could have been an agent
                    provocateur, so one had to watch out for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Portuguese were responding to criticisms coming out of
                        the UN, from Scandinavia, from all over the place at this time. Towards the
                        end of 1972 they proclaimed that they were going to have elections or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I don't recall the timing exactly, but I don't think Portugal ever had
                    in mind, during the period while Caetano was still the dictator, of giving their
                    colonies independence. I think what they had in mind was some sort of greater
                    Portuguese commonwealth or Lusitania, thinking in terms of having some
                    affiliation with Brazil as part of that. Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea Bissau
                    would all be members of this commonwealth, each with a certain amount of
                    autonomy like the British Commonwealth. I don't think they ever contemplated
                    that Mozambique would be independent on its own. And it was a great talking
                    point with all the Portuguese that the Mozambicanos were actually Portuguese, or
                    at least Portuguese citizens. Their black henchmen...if you were to meet a black
                    teacher at a school and you were there with a Portuguese official, the teacher
                    would hasten to tell you that he was a black Portuguese. This was part of the
                    Portuguese mystique...that they were color blind, had no racial discriminatory
                    tendencies, and intermarried...and I think to a great extent that this was
                    true.</p>
                <p>That doesn't mean that for years the Portuguese weren't hard taskmasters, but
                    basically this was based on a master/servant relationship rather than white
                    race/black race distinction. The Portuguese were not like the British who always
                    felt themselves to be a superior class...well perhaps not always, but in the
                    beginning. I don't think the Portuguese had that feeling. Many Portuguese who
                    came over as farmers to Mozambique married black wives and settled there
                    permanently. Through the decades and generations their descendants became
                    indistinguishable from the blacks themselves. But they retained their Portuguese
                    names. To this day there probably are farmers along the Zambezi River area with
                    Portuguese names who are as African looking as any original Mozambicano.</p>

                        trains, etc. and coming closer to Lourenco Marques.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes and no. They never really gained control over any areas other than
                    the northern portion I mentioned before, so far as I could ever discover. In
                    fact, Frelimo propaganda publications we got would display pictures of Frelimo
                    guerrillas marching through the bushes and/or conquering some unnamed village or
                    other, but there was never anyplace you could identify. So it was very difficult
                    to assess the accuracy of their claims.</p>

                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes, but not many ruined by Frelimo because they weren't ruining
                    many at that time. Towards the end of 1973, I think it was, again my timing is a
                    bit hazy now, Frelimo raids began to penetrate farther and farther south and
                    were beginning to hit places like the Gorongosa National Park (the game park),
                    which was shelled one time causing a great hassle among tourists. They started
                    to lay ambushes along main roads, but these were all hit and run guerrilla
                    operations. They were not land battles involving seizures of territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you recalled during 1973 there were human
                        rights charges against Portugal for torture and the use of napalm against
                        black guerrillas and also at the same time a UN resolution to impose trade
                        sanctions against Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. I don't recall the exact incidents. All I can say is that similar
                    allegations were constantly being made. I suppose at one time, probably still to
                    some extent while I was there, violations of human rights did occur. There were
                    a lot of people in jail. The Portuguese Security Service was very strong and
                    thorough.</p>
                <p>There were rumors of torture, but many of these were exaggerated by Frelimo
                    propaganda. I am quite safe in saying this because I read a lot of it and the
                    wording was always quite similar. They frequently described, for example,
                    Portuguese soldiers playing football with the heads of slain African babies and
                    other comparable horrors. It is conceivable to me that somebody at some point in
                    a moment of insanity might do something like that, but it is hardly the sort of
                    thing one would make a practice of doing.</p>
                <p>And the Portuguese, as far as I could see...and this was perhaps an eye opener to
                    me because when I first arrived I shared these apprehensions about Portuguese
                    cruelty...were no less humane than the British or the French colonizers, and no
                    more savage in their military actions. I never saw any indication of napalm
                    bombing, and never heard rumors of such that I could give any credit to.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I did hear that at one point...and I think this was in late 1973, in any event it
                    was shortly before Kaulza was fired, dismissed or transferred...there was a
                    massacre of Africans in a village called Wiliamo or something like that. The
                    information which came out was very imprecise. A Bishop said he saw many corpses
                    lying on the ground. Frelimo propaganda claimed hundreds had been killed, the
                    Portuguese apparently acknowledged that dozens were killed. It was not certain
                    whether it was at Portuguese instigation. Sources agreed that uniformed black
                    troops committed the deed, but could not prove whether they were black troops
                    under Portuguese command who had gone wild, whether they were Frelimo guerrillas
                    in Portuguese uniforms, as Portuguese propaganda alleged.</p>
                <p>In any event internal machinations in Portugal after the event were such that
                    Kaulza's enemies...General Costa Gomes, to name one, who later on briefly became
                    President of Portugal after the revolution there...managed to oust Kaulza and he
                    was canned. His firing was really the beginning of the end for the Portuguese
                    military effort, and the Frelimo activity gained considerable momentum after
                    that event.</p>
                <p>Wiliamo is the only massacre as such that I had any personal knowledge of, and
                    even that was pretty sketchy.</p>
                <p>You were asking about Rhodesia and I want to finish one thought I gave very early
                    in this interview. You recall that I had orders not to officially acknowledge
                    the existence of the Rhodesian UDI government. Unfortunately for me whenever the
                    Portuguese invited me and the rest of the Consular Corps to go north with them,
                    they also invited the Rhodesian Consul, whose legitimacy the Portuguese
                    recognized. Unfortunately for me also, our pictures were taken on various
                    occasions by news photographers. In one published shot I was standing near the
                    Rhodesian Consul a couple of paces away, both of us listening intently to
                    Kaulza. Somebody complained about this, I don't remember who, possibly the
                    British in London. The Department asked me about it. I told the Department that
                    if they so instructed, I could refuse to go on trips where Rhodesian officials
                    would be present, but if I did so I would lose many opportunities to see things
                    and to find things out. I certainly was not doing anything on these trips that
                    would cause anybody to believe we were special friends of Rhodesia and I
                    suggested that the Department just forget about it. I was faithfully carrying
                    out my instructions not to have formal contacts with Rhodesian consular officers
                    and if I happened to appear in the same photo shot as a Rhodesian official, so
                    be it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometime during 1973, either a statement or a remark
                        saying that he foresaw freedom for Mozambique and I wondered if anything
                        different was coming out of the Department as a consequence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, I don't think I can connect anything up to that particular speech.
                    The Department was always, as I said before, a two-headed monster. The African
                    Bureau was always putting pressure on the Portuguese to disgorge Mozambique and
                    Angola. The European Desk was always trying to soft pedal it without
                    interfering. I think the Department was pretty consistent in trying to keep some
                    pressure on the Portuguese to give up Mozambique.</p>
                <p>Whenever I would chat with a Portuguese I would do my little bit in that
                    direction too. But I had to be a little discreet because I didn't want to
                    antagonize them to the extent that they closed me out of their information
                    circuit. What I got from them was far more important and interesting than what I
                    would have been able to get if they had been hostile to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period were you getting good support from the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes. I got very good support from the Department. I am not so sure
                    the African Bureau always felt it was getting good support from me because in my
                    reporting, almost without being conscious of it, I couldn't help but give the
                    Portuguese point of view because that was what was being drummed into me. I
                    thought I was criticizing it and analyzing it and trying to see to what extent
                    it was correct.</p>
                <p>And that brings up another subject that I have to treat very tangentially. There
                    was certain information on that area that I was not getting in Mozambique for
                    reasons which I don't think can be discussed in an unclassified tape. I would
                    have to go to places like South Africa, Pretoria or other places to read this
                    stuff. So there were things being heard by people elsewhere that pertained to my
                    area which I didn't know about until sometimes weeks after the event.</p>
                <p>I only bring this up because it shows that I had very little means of checking
                    the accuracy of what I was getting from the Portuguese on the spot. If I had
                    been getting the other information currently I could have put the two side by
                    side and then drawn much more accurate inferences from what I was seeing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, but these were things that for reasons I don't think I should get
                    into were not being sent to Mozambique.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: I had one other substantive officer in the beginning plus an American
                    administrative officer and two American secretaries. Also, if I remember
                    correctly, about a dozen or fifteen locally employed Mozambican nationals.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, but the administrative officer included consular activities in his
                    portfolio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't a lot of consular work then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Not very much, but there was a trickle. There was a bit of assisting
                    American nationals who for one reason or another...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, tourists who found themselves in trouble for one reason or
                    another. An occasional sailor and that sort of thing. The administrative officer
                    handled most of such cases.</p>
                <p>My work was mainly political reporting and I had a very fine assistant, Consul
                    Hugh McDougall, who was later replaced by Randy Reed...both of them were
                    excellent officers...who did most of the economic work and also some of the
                    political work. Most of what we did was to follow closely the course of the
                    insurrection and the liberation war. The economic stuff was largely trying to
                    keep track of sanctions breaking by Rhodesia and that sort of thing.</p>

                        probably it didn't come to your attention. Since you did not have much visa
                        work did that mean there were not people fleeing from Mozambique looking for
                        other places to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, not many that I recall. We gave a bunch of Leader Grants and
                    sponsored student exchanges. But I don't recall ever having a refugee seeking
                    asylum.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The people then seemed satisfied to stay in Mozambique up
                        until that time? There was a time when the Portuguese started leaving in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Ah, the Portuguese. This began to become evident in 1974 or in the
                    latter part of 1973. I can't give you exact timing on this, but the things that
                    should have tipped us off to the fact that the Portuguese were approaching their
                    last stand, were happening in the economic sphere. At one point or another
                    Portugal cut down on subsidies and demanded that Mozambique pull its own weight,
                    pay its own way. At the same time Portuguese goods and manufactured goods began
                    to disappear from shelves in the stores. There began to be shortages in various
                    products. We began to hear complaints from some of our local staff that the
                    Portuguese were going to abandon them. Of course at that point we had no reason
                    to believe this was imminent so we said, “nonsense”. But in retrospect it was
                    beginning to be clear that the place was running down.</p>
                <p>The second thing that should have tipped us off more specifically...we knew
                    something was happening but we didn't know how significant it was. There were
                    demonstrations in places like Beira by white Portuguese farmers and businessmen
                    complaining that the army was letting them down, not defending them adequately.
                    This coincided with some of the attacks that Frelimo was beginning to make on
                    Portuguese farms, ambushes on the roads, etc.</p>
                <p>This was striking home to Portuguese who up to that point had had little real
                    contact with the war since practically all the fighting had taken place in the
                    north up to now. The Portuguese in the central and southern part of the country
                    never heard a shot fired in anger so far as I could tell. So here suddenly they
                    were being subjected to guerrilla attacks and they didn't like it, so they
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The demonstrations had traumatic effect on the Portuguese military. Suddenly they
                    were being blamed for something they felt they had no control over. Their
                    respected leader (Kaulza) had been taken away from them and a nonentity put in
                    charge and they were now being blamed for losing the war. This played a great
                    part in the eventual coup d'etat that took place in Portugal, which, if you
                    recall, was largely inspired by young military officers. So that was another
                    thing we should have spotted as being a harbinger of the end.</p>
                <p>Then also there were signs which I couldn't document at the time that morale in
                    the army was beginning to crack. I began to hear more information about
                    corruption in the army...how officers would use food allotments that were
                    supposed to go to their soldiers and sell them and that sort of thing. I
                    couldn't document any of this, these were just rumors that we were hearing.</p>
                <p>So in retrospect we should have been alerted late in 1973 that the end was in
                    sight. Up to that point I was convinced that the Portuguese would be able to
                    remain in Mozambique as long as they wanted to stay. And to a certain extent
                    that was still true when they actually left because they were far from being
                    defeated in battle. The military coup d'etat in Portugal had brought young
                    liberal officers into power and they no longer wanted to be bothered with
                    colonial wars overseas, so they stopped them and handed their colonies over to
                    the liberation forces.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you account for this economic slowdown, things
                        disappearing from the shelves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think that since merchants and factory owners were no longer
                    subsidized from Portugal, had to pay their own way, they became more cautious.
                    They used up their inventories and didn't order new products.</p>
                <p>The whole climate began to change towards the end of 1973. The exact timing is
                    hazy in my mind but the key portent was probably the dismissal of Kaulza. These
                    changes became increasingly apparent after he left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was dismissed before the coup d'etat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes. He was dismissed some time after the middle of 1973. It may
                    have been a little earlier than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the coup d'etat in Lisbon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That was in early 1974.</p>
                <p>One thing I would like to talk about a little bit more is the Portuguese
                    themselves. As an African specialists I went out to Mozambique with considerable
                    misgivings and with not the greatest appreciation of the Portuguese, to say the
                    least. I thought of them as probably very poor colonists and rather cruel,
                    insignificant people.</p>
                <p>I couldn't have been more wrong. I think the Portuguese are a strong and very
                    interesting people with a distinguished past. Whatever they did as colonists in
                    the early days...and I am talking about from 400 years ago up to the
                    1950's...they probably were no better or worse than any other colonists. But I
                    can say that based on what I saw during my three years in Mozambique they were
                    not very much different from their French and English counterparts at my other
                    African posts, and no less concerned with the welfare of the people they were
                    controlling.</p>
                <p>The problem with the Portuguese was that Portugal was the poorest country in
                    Europe and they just didn't have anywhere near the resources to throw into their
                    colonies that Great Britain and France had. I am not trying to denigrate Great
                    Britain and France because they were, I think, good colonizers. But the
                    Portuguese were comparable to them and they tried to educate their subjects. But
                    they didn't try until quite recently to do so. The first black African to
                    graduate from the University of Lourenco Marques did so in 1972. He was an
                    engineer, if I remember correctly.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The Portuguese culture is a very strong, interesting one. The Portuguese people,
                    as such, are very formal, courteous, conservative, not great humorists, but with
                    a flair. They consider themselves as having a great flair for adventure and
                    doing extraordinary things. And I suppose they do, or at least, did.</p>
                <p>The people of Mozambique were not...it wasn't an all black versus white
                    proposition. First of all, as I have already said, the Portuguese intermingled
                    very thoroughly with the blacks and those who had been there for any length of
                    time were almost indistinguishable from the Africans. This was certainly true of
                    the settlers and the old farmers.</p>
                <p>As in every other African country, tribalism, or ethnic diversity plays a great
                    part. The Makonde were the main tribe that was supporting Frelimo. There was an
                    even larger tribe residing south of the Makonde called the Makua, who were quite
                    pro-Portugal. It was from the Makua that most of the black troops that fought on
                    the Portuguese side came. But there were many other tribes and I think they all,
                    had they been given their choice, would have chosen to have the Portuguese
                    leave. I don't think any of them were happy to have Portugal control them. But I
                    think many of them recognized that they got certain benefits from Portugal.</p>
                <p>Indeed the Portuguese ran a fairly impressive colony. Lourenco Marques was a
                    clean city with high-rise apartment houses. The elevators worked, the police
                    worked, the telephones worked, the streets were relatively clean, etc. And this
                    was true in Beira and other cities as well, up in the central and northern
                    portions of Mozambique. There was a college with a number of African students.
                    There were something on the order of 500,000 to 600,000 African kids in primary
                    and secondary schools...mostly in the Lourenco Marques area...out of a
                    population of about seven million, I think it was at the time. (This population
                    figure may be country wide, I will have to check that out.) But an amazing
                    number were in primary school, considerably fewer in secondary school and a very
                    few were in the one university. Those few Mozambicans who did have a university
                    degree usually got it abroad.</p>
                <p>So the Portuguese as I say did have something to be said for them.</p>
                <p>Now, one of the problems was that while my orders from the Department were
                    consistent, I knew there was a great deal of controversy in the Department
                    between the African and European Bureaus as to how much pressure should be put
                    on the Portuguese and how much weight should be given to any given information
                    depending on its source. Of course, whenever I went to the Department's African
                    chiefs of mission conferences, this sort of thing would become evident.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>My colleagues in Nairobi or Senegal or places like that, would always advocate
                    putting heavier pressure on the Portuguese and casting our lot in with the
                    Africans. I would say, “Now just a moment, don't go too fast. Don't forget we
                    are dependent on the Portuguese for a number of things. Who are you going to put
                    in the place of the Portuguese when they leave?” At that point it wasn't at all
                    certain that Frelimo had the technical know how to control or run an entire
                    country. They claimed to be in control of vast areas in the country, but, of
                    course, as I have already indicated, if they had control over 10 percent of the
                    country that was probably an exaggeration and they had no government as such in
                    operation. Many Frelimo leaders were in exile. They had some very fine men, some
                    very intelligent people, mostly leftist. It was largely a Marxist organization.
                    I always felt that before you tried to get rid of the Portuguese we should be
                    sure that it was done in such a way that whatever government took their place
                    was not anti-American and did not take action that would be greatly against our
                    interests. So, this was just internal...these were things we had to worry about
                    and decide.</p>
                <p>I remember from attending previous African chiefs of mission conferences, that my
                    predecessors in Lourenco Marques had said very much the same thing that I was
                    saying now, although with some differences because it was earlier in the game.
                    And they were almost taken apart by the Assistant Secretary, who at that time
                    was a very liberal, fine man, but completely and wholeheartedly committed to the
                    black African point of view and who regarded what was going on in Mozambique
                    with the insights that he got from other African countries, which were almost
                    without exception, anti-Portuguese and pro-Frelimo. The exceptions, as I think I
                    mentioned before, were Malawi, South Africa and Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody seemed to worry about the point that you
                        mentioned—how are they going to govern themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, this was very evident at the time of the coup in Portugal. I don't
                    know if it is too early to go into this, but the coup took place on April 25,
                    1974 and almost immediately everything changed completely. It became quite
                    apparent that the Portuguese were going to leave Mozambique very soon. The
                    press, newspaper people in Lourenco Marques started to report freely. In fact
                    one of my contacts in the press came up to me and said, “You know this is
                    interesting. Here I am, I have spent years trying to get articles published in
                    which we have to guard our language and use all sorts of arcane devices to get
                    our point across without violating censorship rules and being taken off to
                    court. Now, suddenly, the press is free and we don't know how to handle it. We
                    don't know what to say. We can say anything we want, but we have no guidelines.”
                    They found it very difficult to adapt themselves to press freedom.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>One point I want to make now is that the coup in Portugal took everybody in
                    Mozambique by surprise. Perhaps it shouldn't have, but it did. It even took
                    Frelimo by surprise. Shortly after the coup, General Costa Gomes, Army Chief of
                    Staff in Portugal, who landed on his feet during this coup...he was Kaulza de
                    Arriaga's great enemy because Kaulza had once blown the whistle on him for
                    attempting a coup d'etat in Portugal years ago, and Costa Gomes never forgave
                    him for that, anyway he came to Lourenco Marques and offered a cease-fire.</p>
                <p>In other words Portugal offered Mozambique to Frelimo on a silver platter.
                    Frelimo propaganda right up to that time had been along the lines that everybody
                    should be prepared for a long struggle, which would continue if necessary for 15
                    years. Suddenly Frelimo was presented with the opportunity to take charge and
                    they weren't prepared for it. They couldn't take over immediately. They had to
                    establish an interim government. I think it took at least a year before they
                    actually took over formally and became the official government, although they
                    were certainly involved in all decisions almost from April 25 on.</p>
                <p>At our Consulate General there was a great deal of reporting to be done.
                    Portuguese military information had practically fizzled out and we were finding
                    it difficult to keep in touch with events. Well, right after April 25 we had
                    more than enough to handle. I had indicated my intention of retiring from the
                    Foreign Service, but it was apparent that too much was happening. (I'm a little
                    off on my timing, it wasn't April 25 when it became apparent that things were
                    happening, it was a little bit before then.) I offered to stay on a couple of
                    extra months until my successor, Peter Walker, arrived.</p>
                <p>During those two months, from April 1 to May 31, I was busier than I had ever
                    been with the type of reporting that I enjoyed most: analysis of political
                    events that were unfolding, the ability to attend meetings between the
                    Portuguese who were turning over and the representatives of the black community
                    and Frelimo. At that point there was just a plethora of stuff to send in. It was
                    a vital, interesting time. I felt in my element and enjoyed those two months,
                    professionally, about as much as the three previous years put together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a group called GUMO.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: This was really an organization built around a very interesting young
                    woman named Joanna Simao. I have to go back a bit. About eight months before
                    this Portuguese officials began to hint that some great liberal, black
                    Mozambicano was going to appear on the scene. And sure enough, Joanna Simao
                    appeared. She had once been very closely connected with Frelimo and had been, I
                    think, jailed for a time in Portugal. The Portuguese evidently counted on her to
                    be one of the leading African participants in their plans for eventual turnover
                    of administrative responsibilities to black nationalists and black political
                    figures. She came out to Lourenco Marques and did a lot of talking. She said
                    things nobody had dared to say against the Portuguese and Portuguese rule. She
                    used to come around and speak to me. She wanted to get to the States to make her
                    point. I think, indeed, we did eventually give her a Leader Grant. It became
                    more and more evident as time went on that she was probably in the pay of or in
                    some way beholden to the Portuguese. There was very little question that she had
                    been sponsored by them, but they thought they were being very subtle in the way
                    they were doing it and that nobody would find this out. But it became quite
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>Before the coup took place she organized a group called GUMO (Grupo Para O Unidad
                    de Mocambique). This was a group of ex-Frelimo people. Frelimo was not a
                    monolithic structure, there were a lot of opposing elements within the
                    organization. There were forces tangling with each other. In fact, Edwardo
                    Mondlane was murdered by a letter bomb and one of the rumored perpetrators of
                    this foul deed was one of his former companions, Uriah Simango. It was never
                    proved, of course. Frelimo claimed it was the DGS, the Portuguese Secret Service
                    which had sent the bomb. My own feeling was that the DGS probably could have
                    done it much more easily long before then and that while it may have been
                    implicated, I thought the evidence was fairly convincing that some of his
                    opponents in Frelimo were involved also. Don't forget, he had an American wife
                    and was considered to be more moderate than some of them. It is conceivable that
                    some of his compatriots wanted to do away with him. It would have been an
                    extraordinarily stupid thing for the Portuguese to have done, but they may still
                    have done it, I don't know.</p>
                <p>So Joanna Simao started this group (GUMO). But as soon as Frelimo came into the
                    picture after the coup, she began to pull back and tried to make up to Frelimo.
                    But they would have nothing to do with her and put her into some form of
                    detention...reeducation I think they called it. That is where she was when I
                    last heard of her which was years ago...ten, twelve years ago. I have no idea
                    what became of her since. But she was a very impressive young woman. A very good
                    orator. She was obviously somebody who to the Portuguese must have seemed just a
                    gold mine, an ideal person to put in charge and keep under surreptitious
                    control.</p>

                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. I don't recall that particular incident, but I do remember that the
                    Portuguese military had air supremacy. They had the only military airplanes in
                    Mozambique. It was a very small air force. I suppose the entire air force was
                    fewer than 50 planes. They had a few jets. Most of the planes were propeller
                    driven trainers. Some of them were Nord Atlas troop carriers which looked a
                    little like smaller editions of our own Hercules aircraft, big bellied transport
                    planes. They used to put jet boosters on the wings so they could take off
                    quickly and steeply, and avoid any ground fire if they happened to be in areas
                    where fighting was taking place. They had a few helicopters as well.</p>
                <p>A rumor came in that Frelimo had gotten some SAM 7 missiles—Soviet. We sort of
                    pooh poohed this idea. Then at one point two of our military attach�s from some
                    other country, possibly from Portugal, visited Mozambique and were flown all
                    over the place by the Portuguese. One of my Portuguese contacts told me that a
                    plane flying our military attach�s had been narrowly missed by a SAM and that
                    this was highly confidential. When our attach�s returned they briefed me on the
                    trip, but didn't say anything about a missile. So finally I asked them
                    outright...after all we were on the same side and I felt they should be frank
                    with me as I had been with them. I said, “I have heard from impeccable sources
                    that you were almost hit by a missile.” They were taken aback and said, “How did
                    you know?” I said that I had my sources, and didn't they think they should have
                    told me. We had been worried about SAMs for a long time and it was something
                    that I had to report. There would have been questions asked somewhere along the
                    line if they had reported it and I hadn't.</p>
                <p>So Frelimo did have missiles, but not very many of them. I think indeed they did
                    shoot down some planes. You see everything you got was propaganda in a way. You
                    got it from both sides. The Portuguese gave you what they wanted you to know and
                    the Frelimo made similar claims. At one time the Frelimo claimed that they had
                    launched a rocket attack on the runway at the Tet airport in north central
                    Mozambique and had destroyed it. Well it just happened by sheer luck that I
                    landed on that same runway the day after the rocket attack had supposedly taken
                    place. Not only had they not hit the runway, I didn't see any sign of a hole or
                    damage anywhere along the line. I was looking for it having heard the Frelimo
                    announcement on the radio. I eventually heard that some rockets had indeed been
                    launched but that they had hit about a half a mile away from the airfield. But
                    people at home for just a brief moment thought things were really heating up.
                    Well, they weren't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at the time that you left Mozambique, the end of May,
                        the first of June, there hadn't been an election?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, I don't recall an election. I do recall that the Governor General,
                    Pimentel dos Santos, had left. He resigned. If I remember correctly an air force
                    general or an admiral, some military figure, took over on a temporary basis.
                    They brought in a number of people to take part in an interim government. Then
                    long after I left Frelimo sent in representatives to take charge. Chissano, the
                    present President was then Foreign Minister...he came in and set up an interim
                    government. About a year later Machel marched in and took over with great
                    fanfare. But that was long after my absence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Mozambique could you tell us something
                        about the CODELs or visits? You haven't mentioned anyone coming out from the
                        States or the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, we had a fair trickling of VIPs. Congressman Crane came out.
                    Then-Congressman, later Senator John Heinz came out because he was married to a
                    Portuguese woman whose father was a doctor in Lourenco Marques. One of the high
                    officials in the Nixon Administration came out, I can't remember his name now. I
                    do remember that General Kaulza gave him a Soviet automatic rifle and it was
                    inscribed to him. He kindly left it in my care saying, “Send it to me via pouch,
                    please.” I said, “Well, I'll do my best.” But as it turned out we couldn't get
                    it in the pouch, it was against all rules. We had no way, strangely enough, of
                    getting that blasted weapon back home. So I finally decided that I wouldn't
                    fight the system any longer and I would leave it up to my successor. I put it in
                    the code room and forgot about it. I don't know what happened to it to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>The big visit while I was there was that of the National War College. This was
                    quite interesting because, if I remember correctly, the Department didn't want
                    them to go to South Africa because of the apartheid business and there was great
                    pressure to keep them from going there. So the National War College said that
                    they would like to come to Mozambique instead. There was a great hassle about
                    that too because the African Bureau I think was none too pleased. The National
                    War College persisted. The Portuguese got wind of it and were delighted to have
                    them come because what better way of getting across the Portuguese military
                    point of view was there?</p>
                <p>So the War College came and let me tell you that for a small office with three or
                    four Americans and a dozen or so nationals to handle a group of 30 odd officers
                    and State Department people was not easy, but we did it. The Portuguese put on a
                    great show, had fine briefings in which they put forth the Portuguese point of
                    view.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The Portuguese line was that their fight against Frelimo was really a fight
                    against communism. Frelimo was a communist organization, they were a part of a
                    communist plot to take over the southern part of Africa. First they were going
                    to get control of Mozambique and Angola and then they were going to aim for
                    South Africa. From there they would hop over to Brazil and get a foothold in
                    Latin America. Then go up through Panama, Mexico and threaten the United States.
                    And that with very little exaggeration was exactly what their line was. They had
                    maps with arrows pointing to all these areas. So the National War College got
                    the big treatment.</p>
                <p>Kaulza and his people were most anxious to get the group up north, to Nangade,
                    which is right on the border of Tanzania, right in the middle of the Makonde
                    area and subject to shelling and all that. The Department of State and Defense
                    put their foot down and said no, that it was politically infeasible. I had a
                    very difficult time explaining this to the Portuguese and getting them to accept
                    it. Anyway, they were happy to have the College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think it must have been in late 1972 or early 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally the War College tours are in the spring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: There was a chiefs of mission conference in Addis Ababa right after the
                    War College visit. As the War College group was going to Ethiopia, I hitched a
                    ride with them in their plane. So if you could find out when that chiefs of
                    mission conference was held it would indicate exactly when the War College was
                    in Mocambique.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I might add, it was a great morale booster for the young unattached
                    ladies in the Consulate General, to have the War College there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back to the country you were serving in at that
                        time you mentioned that you did take a lot of trips and I assume you saw a
                        lot of that large African country. Can you tell us something about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Certainly. Many of the trips I took were on my own, although I usually
                    had to get the assistance of Portuguese authorities in terms of getting
                    accommodations, arranging transportation, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I also took a lot of trips as part of Kaulza's efforts to bring the Consular
                    Corps into the picture. This was all part of Portugal's attempt to gain
                    acceptance and keep us on their side. I remember one of the places he used to
                    love to take us was Nangade, which I think is the northernmost, or one of the
                    northernmost towns in Mozambique. It was right in the heart of Makonde
                    territory. The Makonde, as I think I told you, was the tribe which supported
                    Frelimo and occupied one of the areas that Frelimo controlled. Nangade was a
                    fortified enclave right in the middle of this Makonde area. It was heavily
                    fortified by the Portuguese. To get in there they would fly a plane in at a very
                    high altitude and then descend in tight circles in order to get down to the air
                    field as quickly as possible without encouraging enemy gun fire. Nangade was
                    frequently under fire from across the river. It was right next to the Ruvuma
                    River which is on the border of Tanzania. It was shelled from across the river,
                    probably from within Tanzania. It was interesting to know that Frelimo had many
                    of its camps in Tanzania. I was lucky because during the several times I visited
                    Nangade no shells were received or sent.</p>
                <p>Other trips that I can recall that were especially interesting were visits to the
                    headquarters of the Portuguese armed forces in Nampula, located in the northern
                    part of Mozambique. In Nampula we used to see training exercises by the troops,
                    parachute jumps and things of that sort. I found them quite impressive. The
                    morale of the parachute troopers seemed very high. They were very skilled in
                    their jumping abilities and their training methods seemed very up to date and
                    effective. There were quite a few black troops among them as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interested in what you saw. You did a lot of flying,
                        saw Mozambique from the air. What did the surface look like? Is it at this
                        period of time total forest cover? Was there much devastation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No. From the air it was very difficult to see any devastation. In fact,
                    I didn't see too much devastation because there wasn't that much heavy fighting
                    in any part of Mozambique when I was there. The fighting was largely in the
                    north. There is some forestation there, but I would say that Mozambique is
                    largely savannah country and scrub. There are forested areas but it is not rain
                    forest type country. The climate can get hot but it is not bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the rain fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Good heavens, you are asking me for statistics that I can't remember.
                    There is a monsoon season. There is quite a bit of rain fall. It certainly is
                    not a desert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main occupation of the tribes or the people
                        living outside of Lourenco Marques? You mentioned farmers, were there a lot
                        of farmers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: There were some. It is a mixture of all sorts of things. There are a
                    number of towns in that area. The farmers are largely north of Lourenco Marques
                    in farming settlements, many of them in the Limpopo and Zambezi River areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The London Times, February 1974, reported something about
                        the movement of Africans into protective villages. Did you know anything
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes. This was a tactic which I think the Portuguese had learned from
                    the British and to a certain extent from us in Vietnam. The British had adopted
                    this tactic in Malaya and we did it in Vietnam with our new hamlets. The idea is
                    that you take people who are dispersed throughout wide areas and very vulnerable
                    to terrorist attack or pressure to supply food, etc. and bring them together in
                    protected areas. These areas were surrounded by barbed wire and theoretically
                    had all the facilities...huts, schools for the children, infirmaries, pretty
                    basic. Militia were stationed in each village to protect the villagers. The
                    people were all registered so that any strangers who came in, in theory at
                    least, would be noticeable. I believe the Portuguese had a fair amount of
                    success with this tactic.</p>
                <p>“Mad Mike” Calvert visited Mozambique. He had been with Wingate's Raiders in
                    Burma during World War II and in Malaya during the emergency there. He was an
                    expert on guerrilla, jungle warfare. He came to Mozambique to offer his advice
                    to the Portuguese on these protected villages.</p>
                <p>The war ended before the Portuguese had a chance to see if these tactics would
                    work. When they started to use protected villages everybody thought the struggle
                    with Frelimo would go on for at least a dozen, twenty, thirty years. If it had,
                    one would have been able to tell whether the protected villages would keep the
                    guerrillas away from the people. I just don't know what the ultimate result was.
                    But I visited a number of them. They were very much like the new villages in
                    Malaya that I had seen some twenty years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Portuguese were in Mozambique for a long time. How
                        wide spread was the use of the Portuguese language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, extremely wide spread. It was the lingua franca of the country. Like
                    all African countries there are many dialects and languages in Mozambique. They
                    are certainly as different as French is from Spanish or even German. The only
                    language that they all spoke and the language that Frelimo propaganda was
                    written in was Portuguese. It was the same in Uganda: all the politicians spoke
                    English...as they did in India. One of the attributes of colonialism was, I
                    suppose, that it gave large areas a lingua franca they otherwise wouldn't have
                    had.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is right, although Africans are pretty good linguists. The average
                    African who is educated usually speaks a half dozen dialects of one sort or
                    another in addition to the lingua franca. But Portuguese was the language
                    commonly spoken.</p>

                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, I suspect it is still there. I suspect they are speaking Portuguese
                    more than any other single language. English, of course, is I think more and
                    more becoming a world language. There were quite a few English speakers in
                    Mozambique as well.</p>

                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, they were very important. You had, of course, the Catholic
                    missionaries, usually priests of one denomination or another. But the ones I got
                    to know best were the Protestant missionaries who were predominantly American or
                    Swedish. We had some very close friends among the American Methodist
                    missionaries. They had their headquarters right outside Lourenco Marques. But
                    they also had a very fine hospital up in...they called it Chikukwe...quite far
                    up the coast near Inhambane...several hundred miles north of Lourenco Marques.
                    This place had an excellent hospital with skilled American doctors and nurses. I
                    remember being extremely impressed by the fact that one doctor would normally
                    perform as many as 30 hernia operations in one morning. They had hundreds and
                    hundreds of patients...both in and out patients. They also ran a leper village.
                    I believe that hospital is working again now. It ran into very bad times
                    immediately after independence because I think the Frelimo was quite loath at
                    first to rely on foreign medical help.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 25, 1991 and this is tape 2 of an
                        interview with Hendrik Van Oss, a Foreign Service officer who was in
                        Shanghai in 1948-50. I understand, Mr. Van Oss, that this was your first
                        post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, it was our first post abroad. I had been in the Department for six
                    years before that. I was newly married to Anne and we arrived as freshmen
                    knowing nothing about what a post is like. I knew only a little bit about
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That harbor was and still is an important one on the east
                        coast of Asia. Do you remember whether it was used very much when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I don't recall that it was used very much for trading purposes, but
                    don't forget that in 1948 China was in the last stages of a civil war. People
                    weren't sending much in. However, Shanghai, itself, the post, the Consulate
                    General, was a huge post. It was one of our biggest establishments in the world.
                    I think only Paris and London were larger. It had a large economic section, so
                    they must have been covering something. Probably by this time it was mainly what
                    was going on in the rest of China, not so much worried about actual exports from
                    and imports to Shanghai.</p>
                <p>Shanghai was an important city. A cosmopolitan city. The Communists later said it
                    was an excrescence or goiter on the body of China proper. It was different from
                    any other Chinese city except that there were a lot of Chinese there, of course.
                    There were also lots and lots of non-Chinese. There were many German Jewish
                    refugees, White-Russian refugees, Iraqi Jewish refugees. It was a polyglot and
                    fast moving city. A naughty city. A wicked city. A busy city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in June 1948 the Nationalists were still
                        there and all their ships were still there in the harbor. In 1949 didn't
                        they withdraw all the ships out of the harbor and take them to Formosa? Do
                        you remember that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think you have to be aware of what it was like. There weren't many
                    ships in Whangpoo River harbor. The harbor was very extensive and from what we
                    saw in the Bund area, there were very few ships that came in. And when they did
                    come in, like the General Gordon, a great to-do was made over it. So there
                    wasn't a big fleet of commercial vessels just waiting there. Now there may have
                    been in an earlier day, but certainly not in the time we were there.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>On the other hand in Soochow Creek there were many, many sampans and other small
                    craft with people living on them and things like that. But big ocean going
                    vessels, there weren't very many. There were ferries that went across the river
                    harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were French and British zones I understand. Were
                        they north of the city near the race course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, it is hard to remember. As I recall the old city north of the
                    international city, which is where we had our offices and most of the large
                    buildings and banks were, there was a French section and a British section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have put the two race courses up here (pointing to a map
                        of the city). I thought that might pin point something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, all I know is that we used to go to the race course and to get to
                    where we lived we went past the race course on Bubbling Well road, but I would
                    have thought it was more to the west.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you arrived in Shanghai in June 1948. The Nationalist
                        hadn't left. What was your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I was in the political section. I was a vice consul, third
                    secretary...probably the only one in the Service at that time. My boss was a
                    China hand named A. Sabin Chase who was pretty fluent in Chinese. There were
                    several other people in the section besides myself including Fern Cavender, who
                    was a staff officer doing political work. I can very well remember arriving in
                    Shanghai on the President Cleveland, getting off on a crowded dock. There were
                    no long lines or efficient treatment of passengers. You just got off the boat,
                    made your way through a throng of people to the gate. As you had been warned you
                    kept one hand on your wallet and the other hand on your wife and made your way
                    as best you could. Everything was in great confusion, there was lots of noise.
                    It was quite an experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean there was no one to meet you at the dock?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: There was but you had to get through that initial throng to get to the
                    place where they were waiting for you. We made it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't you quite the envy of your colleagues in
                        Washington going to such a romantic place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, I don't know. I think they pitied me, thinking we would get killed
                    in the war that was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any Chinese language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, but I had applied to be a Chinese language officer and had been
                    accepted as such. But since I had already spent six years in the Department it
                    was felt that I should get going on my so-called career. They told me I could
                    take up the language in Shanghai after I got there. Well I did. I started
                    studying it and got a couple of hundred words under my belt and then I was sent
                    on a temporary assignment to Seoul, South Korea, to help gather documentation,
                    microfilm documents, and other reference material in the government prior to the
                    turning over of control by the U.S. occupying forces to the first South Korean
                    independent government in August, 1948. I was part of a team of four persons. My
                    job was to handle the biographic material. So I spent about six weeks there
                    (Korea) right in the beginning of my tour in Shanghai.</p>
                <p>When I got back to Shanghai I found that I had contracted hepatitis in Korea so I
                    spent another six weeks or so in the American military hospital. By the time I
                    got out of the hospital all hell was breaking loose. The Communists were
                    advancing. They had taken Peking and were advancing down towards the Yangtze
                    River and Nanking, which was then the capital of the Nationalist government. A
                    lot of wives were being sent home from the Consulate General. Fortunately for
                    me, Anne was working for the military attach�, so she was allowed to remain. But
                    many people began to leave Shanghai at that time.</p>
                <p>So really there was no chance to study the language properly, and I couldn't
                    devote much time to it. Besides many people spoke English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were reporting...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: We were reporting the news of the progress, or lack thereof, of the war
                    as we saw it from Shanghai. Of course there was a big political reporting
                    section in our embassy in Nanking. And we had posts in Hangzhou, Mukden,
                    Tientsin, Tsingtao and Peking, and all of them were reporting too. Peking fell
                    just about that time. So we knew pretty much what to expect. In other words the
                    Department was not dependent on Shanghai for everything it learned about what
                    was going on in China. But I dare say we reported just about as much as anybody
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall anything particularly that you were assigned
                        to? I am just trying to get a picture of what a junior officer would be
                        given.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. It is a little difficult to say. I did a number of things. First of
                    all I handled all the biographic stuff because that was what I had done in the
                    Department. I was the so-called “expert”. Then I was the main liaison with what
                    they called the Third Force...the liberal non-communist Chinese who we hoped
                    would be friendly to us and a bridge between what we thought even then certainly
                    would become a Communist government and the United States.</p>
                <p>There was one fellow, Carson Chang, for example, who was the chairman of one of
                    these third parties. He was an old man, a scholar. I remember his house was just
                    filled with books. The rooms were like the stacks in a library. You had to weave
                    your way between shelves of books. I used to go to see him and get his views on
                    what was happening.</p>
                <p>There was another liberal leader, Lo Lung-chi, who had tuberculosis. We were
                    keeping him alive by sending him antibiotics. He was kept under detention by the
                    Nationalist government in a hospital and we would visit him from time to time to
                    deliver the antibiotics and find out what was going on with him.</p>
                <p>Also I was protocol officer. John Cabot, the Consul General, appointed me
                    protocol officer. That meant that I had to arrange the seating at tables for his
                    parties. I had to meet people who were not quite important enough for him to
                    meet but important enough so that somebody had to meet them. One of the things
                    that I had to do was whenever Ambassador Leighton Stuart came down from Nanking
                    I had to escort him back to the plane when he left. He came down quite
                    frequently. He was a delightful old gentleman, a scholar and as you probably
                    know a former president of one of the colleges in Peking (Yenching University).
                    He probably knew as much about China as any man alive. So I got to know him
                    reasonably well.</p>
                <p>The other job I had to do was take care of Japanese repatriation. The Japanese
                    who were either living in Shanghai or had been caught in Shanghai were being
                    repatriated on a systematic basis back to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was paying for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I guess we were to some extent. We were still very much in control
                    of things in Japan. General MacArthur and his retinue ran the country. The
                    repatriation was quite interesting because it was something I really didn't know
                    much about. I would be in my office and a Japanese would arrive with a long list
                    of names of candidates for repatriation that he would hand to me for approval. I
                    would look at the list very studiously for as long as I thought was decent and
                    then I would give my approval and he would leave. Then the listed Japanese would
                    be shipped out on some ship that would take them back to Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The most interesting development in that connection, and this was something that
                    nobody else paid any attention to...as the Communists came closer to Shanghai
                    there was a great deal of concern as to what should be done with Japanese
                    prisoners of war. There was a prisoner of war camp right outside Shanghai which
                    had all sorts of interesting people in it, including General Onama (commander of
                    Japanese land forces in China) if I remember his name correctly, and a number of
                    admirals. The whole command structure of the Japanese army and navy that had
                    been left in China after the close of the war. So this became quite a
                    negotiation. General MacArthur sent a Colonel and a troop ship to pick these
                    people up. I had to take the Colonel out to the prison camp and help him
                    negotiate the prisoners' release with the Chinese general in charge. One of the
                    important problems was that Onama and some of the higher ranking Japanese had
                    been tried in a Chinese court for war crimes, and had recently been acquitted so
                    legally they were no longer prisoners of war, even though they were still in the
                    prisoner of war camp because there was no way to get rid of them. The Colonel
                    said he had been given orders to pick up the prisoners of war and nothing had
                    been said about people who were not prisoners of war. He was not quite sure
                    whether he was authorized to take them. The Chinese General was involved in this
                    and thought they should be included. I expressed the view that it would be very
                    difficult if they were still here if and when there was a change of governments
                    as might happen soon. I suggested to the Colonel that he cable his superiors in
                    Japan and check this out. He did so, indicating that the Consul (he promoted me)
                    strongly recommended that the acquitted officers be taken along with the real
                    prisoners. Of course, MacArthur was smart enough to see that this was the thing
                    to do and agreed.</p>
                <p>Another interesting thing was that one of the Japanese generals had suffered a
                    stroke and was very seriously ill. One of the diplomats among the prisoners said
                    that he thought we might lose him if we transported him out of his bed. We
                    arranged for an ambulance to come and pick him up. We had to transport all of
                    these people from the prison to the ship before dawn because we didn't know what
                    the reaction of the crowds in Shanghai would be when we appeared with a lot of
                    ex-Japanese prisoners of war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would recognize them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, they would know they were Japanese, yes. For all we knew they might
                    attack them. We didn't have any soldiers as escort for protection. So we got
                    some huge trucks and buses and drove them out of the prison while it was still
                    dark. The Japanese command structure was still very much in evidence in the
                    prison. The generals had their aides who carried their luggage. They had
                    furniture, baggage, and quite a lot of possessions. It was like a tour. The
                    prisoners and their belongings were all loaded on the trucks and I remember
                    asking the Chinese General, “Have you any lists of names? Aren't you afraid that
                    some one might be left behind?” He laughed and said, “Don't worry about that,
                    they'll all be on those buses.”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We got them out at dawn and over to the dockside. They were all lined up on the
                    dock. The generals were very old men, I was surprised how old they were. They
                    must have been in their sixties-sixties—to me then that was old. They seemed
                    feeble. They were taken on board. But all the others were lined up and had to go
                    through the degrading experience of being sprayed for vermin, lice, etc. Then
                    they were taken on board. I can remember that an American Brigadier General,
                    whose name I have forgotten, came up to me and asked if General Onama was part
                    of the group. I said that he was and was already on board. The American General
                    said he wanted to go on board and shake Onama's hand because he was a fine
                    soldier. So he did.</p>
                <p>That was an interesting little episode as part of my duties.</p>
                <p>It is a bit harder to talk about the political reporting because this was the
                    sort of thing that the newspapers were doing. One thing of interest was that we
                    were worried what would happen when the Communists came and took over the city.
                    Mind you, I don't want to go into all the business of whether the Communists
                    would win or lose because this was much more of an issue at home in the U.S.
                    than it was in China. Over there there was no question about the fact that the
                    Communists were winning. The arms and materials we were sending to support the
                    Nationalists were being wasted. They were given to troops which eventually
                    surrendered with all their weapons, so the Communists probably had more of our
                    stuff than the Nationalists had.</p>
                <p>So it was quite evident from the time I arrived that it was just a question of a
                    few months. It wasn't just I who felt that way. It was evident to all of us
                    including the Consul General. Of course we had to be a little careful how we
                    expressed this view because there was a very powerful China lobby at home and a
                    number of U.S. Congressmen were very much interested and very strong supporters
                    of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists. We couldn't just make it appear that we
                    were selling him short. So we couldn't report as frankly as I am talking to you,
                    although it was quite evident that we found ways of expressing our views that
                    were more acceptable than these words would have been then.</p>
                <p>We were worried about what would happen in the interim between the time that
                    Chiang Kai-shek left and pulled out his troops from Shanghai and the time that
                    the Communists came in. The specter that hovered over our heads was the thought
                    that the Chinese in the old city, all the Chinese poor people and everybody
                    would rise up and plunder the wealthier parts of the city. We were all issued
                    carbines. It was a worry.</p>
                <p>So a lot of what Sabin Chase and I were doing was trying to make contact with
                    forces in Shanghai that would be able to exercise some form of control. This was
                    expected to be just a matter of security for a day or a few days at most. We
                    didn't expect that the turnover process would be lengthy. Sabin did most of this
                    work because he spoke fluent Chinese and I did not. I did a lot of the
                    reporting. He formed a contact with a Chinese Colonel who had close contacts
                    with the so-called Red Gang of Shanghai.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>To go back a bit...it is quite well known that there were secret societies in
                    Shanghai generally referred to as the Triad. The most powerful group was called
                    the Green Gang, and that was headed by a person called Tu Yueh-shun, a
                    mysterious figure who controlled crime, drugs, the underground, and who was one
                    of the powers behind the political scene in Shanghai. A sort of “godfather”. He
                    was also close to Chiang Kai-shek and his henchmen. There was a rival
                    underground group which we called the Red Gang. I can't remember the name of its
                    leader. But the Colonel whom Sabin Chase had contacted was in deep with the Red
                    Gang leader and we arranged through him after a long process of negotiation that
                    the Red Gang would take over and have its men out to keep things under control,
                    prevent rioting, etc. Also, very important was the fact that Lo Lung-chi, whom I
                    mentioned before, needed special protection. We felt that his life was in danger
                    because he was under “protective” care by the Kuomintang. He was confined to a
                    hospital room and the KMT had by this time put a companion in with him, an army
                    officer who was supposed to keep an eye on him at all times. In fact we went up
                    to see Lo while the army officer was there, just to see that he was all right
                    and show the KMT and the army that the American Consulate General was interested
                    in Lo's well being. We were worried lest in the final flurries of pulling out
                    the KMT authorities would start shooting and kill him along with other
                    opposition leaders. They actually did kill some people. People were shot on the
                    street in the last moments of departure.</p>
                <p>As it turned out the turnover was relatively quiet. The Nationalist Army and the
                    police pulled out. The city was very quiet. The next morning the Communists came
                    in. The only fighting that took place was between the Communists and the
                    Nationalists at the point of embarkation where the Nationalists were getting on
                    ships to retreat to Formosa. Lo Lung-chi was rescued, I presume, by the Red Gang
                    because I have a picture of Sabin Chase, myself, Lo Lung-chi, the Red Gang
                    leader, the Colonel and various other Chinese, all standing in somebody's garden
                    celebrating Lo's safe escape. He was a very important man and later became a
                    minister in the Communist government.</p>
                <p>Lo Lung-chi was not a Communist; like Carson Chung he was a member of the Third
                    Force we were courting hoping that they would remain friendly to us. When the
                    Communists first took over they set up a coalition government. They obviously
                    had their Communist hierarchy but they also appointed people like Lo Lung-chi
                    and various other liberals. Lo Lung-chi was made minister of cultural affairs or
                    something like that. Then when Mao Zedong years later encouraged criticism by
                    suggesting that 100 flowers should bloom, Lo Lung-chi was one of the “flowers”
                    who bloomed. He didn't have his bloom cut off, but he was ejected from the
                    government and that was the last I or anyone else I know of heard of him.</p>
                <p>The end of all this was typically Chinese. I think it was about the 23rd of May
                    when the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek held a “victory” march in which he
                    paraded all his troops through the streets of Shanghai with their weapons. There
                    were dancers, bands and all sorts of noise makers. It was called a victory
                    march.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Chiang had a victory march in May of 1949?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, on May 23, one or two days before the Communists entered. So he had
                    his face saving victory march and then pulled out. That night, the night after
                    the victory march, we saw the police...the police station was right down the
                    road from our apartment house which was right across the street from city
                    hall...we saw trucks loading files and driving off into the distance. The next
                    morning we got up and had breakfast as usual. It was very, very quiet in the
                    city. Doug Foreman, a young language officer who had come in from some other
                    post in China...a lot of our diplomatic personnel were leaving China at the time
                    and going out through Shanghai so this was a collection point for people from
                    other posts and Doug Foreman was among them, living in the apartment above ours
                    in Hamilton House.</p>
                <p>He and I decided to go down to the office, about a fifteen minute walk. We
                    started walking down the street and heard a call. Anne was calling us from our
                    balcony which was about eight floors up. She said, “Come back, there is shooting
                    around the Consulate and they don't want anybody going to work.” So we came back
                    and went out on our balcony. Our apartment building (Hamilton House) was on one
                    side of a square. On the other three sides of the square were the Metropole
                    Hotel, the building that formerly housed our Consulate General, and the city
                    hall, so it was an important square. The Nationalists had put a sandbag
                    fortification right in the middle of the square, where the cross streets met.
                    There were still some police manning that. We were looking over the wall of our
                    balcony and saw some figures coming down one of the streets from a great
                    distance. As they got closer we could see that they were armed and very much on
                    guard, looking from side to side with guns at the ready. One man was unwinding a
                    big spool of wire as he was coming along...this was for communications, not
                    explosives. They didn't know what they were facing. They didn't realize that
                    this part of the city was theirs for the taking.</p>
                <p>They came to the sandbag barricade in the crossroads and lined up on all sides
                    leveling their weapons at it. At a signal they ran over it, took the policeman
                    into custody and disarmed him. Then they realized that they were home free and
                    sort of relaxed. By that time a lot of bystanders had appeared on the scene, and
                    the newly arrived Communist soldiers started to harangue the crowd.</p>
                <p>That was the takeover. The only dangerous part was that shooting was still going
                    on close to the Consulate General office which was quite near the point in the
                    harbor at which Nationalist forces were boarding ships in retreat. I think about
                    30 bullets penetrated the Consulate, but nobody was hurt or injured in any way.
                    The closest person to being injured was Doug Foreman and that was the night or
                    day before. In the weeks before the takeover there was a lot of shelling going
                    on and a lot of military activity. The Communists were advancing steadily and at
                    night you could see explosions on the horizon. Very foolishly we used to go up
                    onto the roof of our building and watch the tracer bullets and explosions in the
                    distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Baghdad today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, very much like Baghdad today. In fact exactly like it except the
                    explosives were not quite as big. On one of the last mornings I remember being
                    wakened by several very loud explosions. Things that just rattled the windows
                    and the bed. I thought we were being shelled. I got up, got my binoculars and
                    tried to find a safe place on the roof to see what was going on. I saw that the
                    Nationalists had blown up the docks, or some installations at the docks,
                    possibly some ammunition dumps.</p>
                <p>Towards the end we were on our balcony when we heard a bullet hit our building
                    right up above us. A few seconds later Doug Foreman came down looking rather
                    sheepish and bleeding from a number of little cuts on his chin. He had been
                    standing by the window in the apartment above us and this bullet had hit the
                    metal rim of his window and had shattered the glass. Tiny pieces of glass had
                    cut his chin. That was the one casualty we suffered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did the fighting around the Consulate last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: The fighting took about a day and a half, maybe less. But we were open
                    for business, so-called, after that. You see, when I say we were “open for
                    business” that is a euphemism because the U.S. government did not immediately
                    jump to recognize the new state of affairs. Since we didn't recognize them, the
                    Communist Chinese did not recognize us. We were no longer members of the
                    American Consulate General, we were simply American citizens. While various
                    things happened that made it necessary for us to contact Chinese Communist
                    officials they never acknowledged that we were doing so in an official capacity.
                    They would always ask, “Why are you complaining about so and so, why doesn't he
                    come and complain himself.” And we would say, “Because we are members of the
                    American Consulate General and part of our job is to protect American citizens.”
                    They would reply, “Well, we will take note of what you say as American citizens
                    and will take whatever action we see fit.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they try to get you to leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, indeed. They were simply trying to put pressure on us to recognize
                    them. If we didn't recognize them we had no business to transact with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were well aware of what was going on in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, of course. They knew it and we knew that they knew it. This was all
                    part of the game. We held on to our rights to the best of our ability, but we
                    really didn't have any rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you said a lot of our officers had already left other
                        posts. Did we actually close any other posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. We closed Hangzhou...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did we close them, as the Communists came
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, when the Communists came through. As I recall, the Communists were
                    bombing Hangzhou as one Consul left that city. In fact, I think one of the bombs
                    came close to hitting his ship on the river.</p>
                <p>We had problems in Mukden. Angus Ward, who was our Consul General in Mukden was
                    put in jail for allegedly striking a Chinese citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't he take his two dogs to jail with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I would not be surprised if he tried. He was a character. His wife was
                    there too if I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were not planning to close Shanghai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: As of the moment we are talking about—May, 1949—we still hoped, I think,
                    that we could find some way of making contact with the new government, and
                    seeing if we couldn't repair relations. We had hoped that for a long time but as
                    the Communists advanced Mao Zedong had become increasingly anti-American in his
                    pronouncements. One of their big slogans was “leaning to one side.” This meant
                    leaning towards the Soviets; that became a big thing with them.</p>
                <p>We expected to be open for business and we proceeded on that basis. We tried to
                    make contacts with the Communists but really didn't succeed. Then at some point
                    around November, 1949, the Communists took over our Marine Barracks in Peking.
                    The Marine Barracks had been awarded to us as a result of the treaty at the end
                    of the Boxer Rebellion so we considered it American property. Our government
                    issued a general ultimatum that either we would keep our property and our rights
                    should be respected, or we would have no recourse but to withdraw all of our
                    diplomatic and consular personnel. Of course the Communists had no intentions of
                    giving the Barracks back and didn't, so we announced around December that we
                    would withdraw our people.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>From that time on just about all of our activities were related to closing down
                    the Consulate General and arranging for our evacuation. We also announced to all
                    American citizens in China that the bell had now rung and if they wanted to
                    leave China we would take them out with us. Once we were gone we couldn't
                    guarantee the safety of or be responsible for any Americans remaining in China.
                    We couldn't answer for what might happen to them afterwards.</p>
                <p>Some of the missionaries announced to us they would stay. One of the things that
                    I had to do was to help wrap up the USIS operation. There were a lot of books
                    and information materials that I had to dispose of, including the USIS library.
                    We turned most of the books over to the missionaries. They were just delighted
                    to have them. As things turned out they too had to leave eventually. This was
                    after I had left so I don't know much about their circumstances.</p>
                <p>The business of trying to leave certainly was not easy because as American
                    citizens, not as official personnel, we has to obey all regulations. And these
                    were incredibly complicated. First of all you had to get an exit permit. To get
                    an exit permit you had to have a residence permit. To get the residence permit
                    you had to go and stand in line and get it...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh yes. Before this all you did was send one of the Chinese local staff
                    down and they did everything for you. But this was where I learned to carry a
                    paperback book with me wherever I went. Standing in line I got a lot of reading
                    done. Once you got your exit permit you had to put an advertisement in the paper
                    stating that you were going to leave on such and such a date. You had to have an
                    exact departure date. This advertisement was supposed to indicate to anybody who
                    had any claim whatsoever on you that you were going to leave and that you would
                    settle all claims.</p>
                <p>Now this wasn't as easy as it sounded because a lot of servants held their
                    masters up and forced them to pay a year's separation pay and so on. A lot of
                    the businessmen were being very brutally treated by their labor force. Kept
                    awake all night bargaining, etc.</p>
                <p>Fortunately we didn't have that trouble because we were on good terms with our
                    cook and amah and gave them as much as we could...a lot of foodstuff and
                    clothing...so they left relatively happy and they were decent enough not to hold
                    us up for ransom. And a lot of others had similar relationships. But many of the
                    businessmen and people who had been in Shanghai for a long time did not.</p>
                <p>If the ship, or whatever it was we hoped to go out on, didn't arrive, then we had
                    to redo the whole business every month. So we had to go through roughly the same
                    procedure on a monthly basis. This was a not too interesting and rather painful
                    process.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get a departure date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well now this was another laborious process. It wasn't very easy because
                    the Nationalists had imposed a naval blockade on Shanghai and were bombing
                    Shanghai in a rather desultory fashion. They would send a plane or two over
                    every day and drop one or two or five or six bombs. They had armed ships out
                    beyond the harbor entrance to enforce the blockage. And, what was worst in our
                    eyes, was that our own government didn't want to break the blockade even to help
                    get us out. They were on the side of the Nationalists. We were sort of annoyed.
                    We felt that our lives and welfare should have been uppermost in our
                    government's mind and that it should have insisted that an evacuation ship be
                    allowed to enter.</p>
                <p>Well at one point we arranged for an old LST to come into Shanghai harbor, but
                    somebody pointed out in one of the Shanghai newspapers that this was really a
                    U.S. military vessel so the Communist officials said that they could not allow a
                    military vessel to enter the sacred waters of China. So that plan was shot
                    down.</p>
                <p>Finally we worked out, after a long hard negotiation, a scheme whereby we were to
                    go by train to Tientsin, leave Tientsin harbor by barge which would take us out
                    over the bar where we would transfer from the barge to the General Gordon. That
                    was quite an adventure. The exodus finally took place in April, 1950. We, the
                    remnants of the Shanghai Consulate General, the Embassy in Nanking and one or
                    two other posts, plus several hundred other American residents all descended on
                    Tientsin by train.</p>
                <p>This train trip was really some experience. We were in a first class parlor car
                    with a table between every two seats. Anne and I were on one side of a table and
                    Leonard and Helen Bacon were opposite us. There might have been two or three
                    berths made up in the car which were used by some of the children. There was no
                    water in the car and the toilet broke down. We had to go to another car to use
                    the toilet, which was the oriental bomb-sight type which I am sure you are
                    familiar with. If you aren't, there is nothing to sit on, it is just a hole in
                    the floor.</p>
                <p>The water eventually came back on but was apparently the only water on the whole
                    train so Chinese and others from other cars would troop through our car in long
                    lines to get water. The trip took about 48 hours so we had to spend two nights
                    on the train.</p>
                <p>I remember one night I let Anne sleep on our seat while I slept on top of some
                    luggage in the baggage room. Leonard Bacon delighted himself by finding a ladder
                    which he put on the aisle floor to keep himself up from the filth, and slept on
                    that. General Soule, our military attach�, slept standing up, giving his wife
                    and daughter his seat.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Eventually we arrived in Tientsin and spent a couple of days there doing all
                    sorts of chores including getting exit permits, having all our papers examined
                    and our jewelry checked through customs, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a hotel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh yes, there were hotels. This was no problem. Once we were in Tientsin
                    we thought we were through free. But on our final morning we were gathered on
                    the dock side with all the others and everybody was searched. Some women were
                    taken into barge cabins, and were strip searched. We later found out that they
                    were suspected of smuggling out jewelry. I was very nervous because I was not
                    going to stand for that happening to Anne. I had made up my mind if it came to
                    that I would raise as much hell as I could, diplomat or not. But fortunately it
                    didn't happen. In fact we inflicted more damage on the Chinese than they did on
                    us because we had a dachshund named Bao-Tse which we were taking out with us. He
                    was in a little cage. The customs man ordered us to open the cage. We opened the
                    cage; he struck his finger in and Bao Tse tried to take a nip out of it but
                    fortunately missed. That gave us a great deal of satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Anyway we got on the lighter and barges eventually. I remember at the last minute
                    when we were all just about ready to embark there was a great commotion outside
                    the gate to the dock. A man appeared who shouted in English that he was an
                    American. He said, “They won't let me out. Take me with you.” There was nothing
                    we could do. Somebody went over to see who he was, but the Chinese authorities
                    took him in charge. He made a great fuss and eventually they led him away. He
                    had his hands handcuffed and he raised them over his head so that we could see
                    what had happened. I never did find out who it was, although somebody must have.
                    One of the Chinese officials in the very calm, super-quiet manner that Communist
                    authorities adapt when they know they are in control said, “You mustn't worry
                    about him, we will take care of him and give him some education so that he can
                    understand more how he should act toward the People's Republic of China,” or
                    words to that effect.</p>
                <p>So then we embarked, there was nothing we could do to help this poor fellow. A
                    number of us were on the tug boat which pulled two barges, loaded with the
                    remaining evacuees. We got out over the bar into open water and there was the
                    U.S. troop ship General Gordon waiting for us. But there was a minor storm
                    brewing and the sea became turbulent. We tried to unload one of the barges.
                    Captain Sam Frankel, our naval attach�, almost fell trying to make it up the
                    ladder. So the tug boat and barges pulled away and we decided there was no point
                    in trying to transfer people in the rough water. We spent the night on the tug
                    and barges and waited out the storm. Nobody had expected this, nobody had any
                    food or warm clothing. Anne and I were fortunate in having a blanket available
                    which we shared with someone. The tug had no facilities for passengers and only
                    one toilet. A lot of the women and children were below deck and practically all
                    of them were sea sick.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no seats or anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, we were lying right on the deck huddled under a blanket trying to
                    keep warm and from getting sick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was April?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: This was April, 1950. Walter McConaughy, who took John Cabot's place as
                    Consul General, was a very fine leader. He later became one of our leading
                    ambassadors. He set a fine example for us all. During the whole episode he was
                    dressed immaculately with his necktie and jacket, but looked just miserable and
                    grim, and I thought angry. I went up to him and said, “Walter I suppose you are
                    trying to compose a telegram about the outrageous procedures that we have been
                    subjected to?” He said, “No, Hank, I am much more concerned with the
                    contingencies of the moment.” He then walked over to the boat railing and
                    punched his lunch, as they say. It was a miserable experience.</p>
                <p>The next morning, the storm had abated. We climbed aboard the General Gordon and
                    that was the end of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not quite, you weren't in Japan yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, we didn't go to Japan, we went to Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, several days. On the General Gordon, we were living as the troops
                    did, in stacked up bunks, with men and women in separate dormitories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where was the dachshund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: The dachshund was with us on the boat on the upper deck somewhere. I
                    went up and exercised him every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there were about a thousand of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, I would have thought so but don't hold me to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give me a number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Probably more than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that mean that everyone was gone? The Embassy was
                        closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: All the official personnel were out. I would say almost all of the
                    American citizens were out. But some were not. Some of the businessmen stayed.
                    For example, there was a man named Bill Orchard who was head of the American
                    Express bank in Shanghai. He had to stay because many Chinese had deposited
                    money in his bank years before. In the meantime inflation had taken its toll.
                    The bank wanted to return to them the actual amount they had originally
                    deposited. But they said they wanted what the original deposit was worth now. So
                    they wouldn't let him leave. He stayed in Shanghai quite a while.</p>
                <p>Bob Bryan was a well-known lawyer and judge who was employed in the International
                    section of Shanghai. He stayed and eventually was jailed for several years. He
                    had a terrible time. His hair turned white and I think he got beriberi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back before you evacuated, can you tell us how the
                        Department prepared for this Communist takeover which you said looked
                        inevitable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, obviously by evacuating families and most wives and reducing
                    personnel, cutting what had been a 200 man post down to about 30 or 40. I was
                    lucky enough to be allowed to keep my wife; one other wife stayed. Both Anne and
                    the other wife were working for the Consulate General and the military attach�,
                    which was the reason they were allowed to stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Patsy Turner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, Patsy Turner. Her husband was Vice Consul Dick Turner.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>They also pulled out John Cabot, who had been our Consul General when I first got
                    there. John Cabot was one of our best Foreign Service officers. He was a
                    brilliant officer. A patrician in every sense of the word, which is obvious from
                    his name. He was from Boston, of course. He had been ill for about a year before
                    the Communists came in. The first few weeks or months after the Communists came
                    in were particularly harrowing ones for various reasons. He was under great
                    tension. So eventually the Department decided that it was time to bring him
                    home. So he was transferred. He went out with Ambassador Leighton Stuart.</p>
                <p>The person who should have taken charge after him was Sabin Chase, who was the
                    next senior officer. Not only was he the highest ranking, he was also a Chinese
                    language officer. But the Department in its wisdom, and I think in retrospect
                    they were right to do this, decided that instead of putting Sabin Chase in
                    charge, they would appoint Walter McConaughy who was the next highest ranking
                    man at the Embassy, although ten or fifteen years younger than Sabin.</p>
                <p>Walter McConaughy was a very fine leader and an excellent Foreign Service officer
                    who eventually became Assistant Secretary of State for Chinese Affairs and
                    Ambassador in various places, including Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Sabin Chase was also a very fine officer but a very shy individual and rather
                    soft spoken. He was not an administrator. He readily acknowledged that he knew
                    nothing about it and wasn't really interested. He was a Chinese language
                    officer, a political officer, an analyst, a scholar and those were his
                    fortes.</p>
                <p>McConaughy was put in charge and remained in charge until we evacuated the post.
                    Sabin remained the entire time too and relations between the two of them were
                    completely harmonious. Walter took Sabin's advice on all matters of substance
                    and was meticulous in doing his best to keep Sabin from feeling hurt by having
                    been passed over. I think probably Sabin was quite relieved not to have the
                    responsibility of personnel, evacuation and countless administrative details
                    that had to be handled.</p>
                <p>So the Department pared the post down to the bone and kept those who they thought
                    would be most able to withstand the tensions that were obviously coming up.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing about this whole experience was that it gave me an insight
                    into just what it is like to be in a communist country where the communist
                    government starts from scratch. There are various impressions that I have and I
                    will ramble on about them.</p>
                <p>One of them is the noise factor. There were loudspeakers on every street corner
                    and they were turned on incessantly. If it wasn't Chinese music and opera, it
                    was propaganda. We had propaganda in loud Mandarin at all times during the day
                    or night.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Another impression I have is the extreme thoroughness of the Communists. They
                    intruded into every walk of life. They made people attend infinite numbers of
                    political meetings at which Communist officials talked for countless hours
                    repeating endlessly the same slogans and general theories.</p>
                <p>The early stages of the Communist takeover didn't have much impact on us except
                    for the fact that our government didn't recognize them and we thus had no
                    official status. But we were not molested, cursed or pelted with mud. On the
                    other hand we had to be very careful because one of the things they did early in
                    the game was to take measures to inform foreigners, white men if you will, that
                    they were no longer on a pedestal, were no better than anyone else. In fact,
                    they were a little bit worse than the citizens of China.</p>
                <p>Where this comes into play is that there were still quite a few beggars in
                    Shanghai. Eventually I understand the Communists got rid of them, but they
                    certainly hadn't at this point. The beggars were a nuisance even for the
                    Communists. They would come up to you and would clutch you and do just anything
                    you would allow them to get away with. In the old days you sometimes were forced
                    to push them aside and go about your business. It was about the only thing you
                    could do. Once the Communists had taken over this was no longer possible. The
                    minute you so much as touched a beggar, no matter what he did to you, a
                    policeman would appear and you would be taken into custody. This didn't happen
                    to me but it did happen to a number of Americans and other foreigners. The
                    routine was that they would be hauled before a political commissar, not a judge,
                    and would be asked why they had molested a peaceful citizen of China. Then they
                    would give their case. After that they would be fined or told to write a letter
                    of apology and then allowed to go. But this was unpleasant. It was not great
                    fun.</p>
                <p>And, of course, one of the notorious episodes at the time was the Olive case.
                    Bill Olive was a communications officer. On the day the Chinese Communists held
                    their victory parade (without prior notice)—about a month after the
                    takeover—Bill Olive happened to be in one car and Anne was following in another
                    car to get gas at the godown where we had our gasoline supply. They had to cross
                    one of those steep road bridges that goes over the canal or creek. Two soldiers
                    jumped out at Bill Olive, who was in the lead, and tried to stop his car. They
                    held up their hands. He either ignored them or didn't see them, drove over the
                    bridge and was stopped on the other side. But Anne was fortunate enough to stop.
                    Bill Olive's car then was sent along the canal on the other side and stopped.
                    Bill put his hand out and motioned to Anne to get out of there, which she did.
                    This was the last we saw of Bill Olive for a while. We didn't know where he was,
                    he had just disappeared.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Eventually we found out that he had been taken to court, in fact was in jail. He
                    told me this story afterwards. He was taken to the police station. All was well.
                    He explained what he was doing. A police officer quizzed him. He asked if he
                    could call the Consulate and just then the police officer was joined by one of
                    these political commissars. The latter took over and claimed that Bill was
                    trying to brush past guards of the Peoples Republic of China and interfere with
                    the victory parade. By this time Bill was a little nervous and asked again to
                    call the Consulate. The commissar said something like there isn't a Consulate
                    any more, he couldn't call.</p>
                <p>Then he told Olive that they were going to retain him for a night or two. Olive
                    protested vigorously and the commissar ordered the guards to take him away. Bill
                    struggled and grabbed the bench in front of the desk and knocked over a bottle
                    of ink which, I guess, spilled onto the political commissar. He was then pulled
                    back, thrown to the ground and beaten severely by the armed guards. They then
                    took him and flung him into a jail with a lot of other detainees. That is how we
                    found out where he was.</p>
                <p>Later I think they put him into solitary confinement. I am not sure about that
                    but anyway they wouldn't let him sleep. They kept the light on and kept taking
                    him out for interrogation. This turned out to be the first instance of
                    “brainwashing” that any of us had heard about first hand. They told him that the
                    United States was worse than Nazi Germany and had committed grievous sins
                    against the Peoples Republic of China. He, Bill Olive, as a representative of
                    the U.S. government was just as guilty as that government. The grilling went on
                    incessantly for several days. By the end of those days he was so beaten
                    down...oh, and they made him write out endless numbers of confessions. By the
                    end of those few days he could write out exactly what they wanted him to say,
                    and almost believed he was as guilty as they told him he was. This was all in
                    his mind, obviously. He was in pretty bad shape at that point.</p>
                <p>Anyway to cut this short, I don't know exactly how long he was in jail but it was
                    something like four or five days, perhaps a week. Eventually Sabin Chase and
                    Bill Supple, our security officer, got him out. They almost got themselves
                    arrested in the process, but they were able to get him released and bring him
                    home. Olive was eventually evacuated from Shanghai. I am not sure what happened
                    to him afterwards. I think he had psychological problems from then on.</p>
                <p>This was a rather ominous event.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So our diplomats were really in a very precarious
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: The Olive case was the only episode of that sort at the time and you
                    could say that the authorities had some flimsy excuse because he did ignore
                    their original instruction to stop his car. Later on, of course, after we
                    Americans had left, the British stayed behind and were subjected to all kinds of
                    embarrassing experiences. They were jailed, forced to kowtow, frog hop across
                    the room and so on. Terribly humiliating.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the British recognized Red China and still they had
                        this treatment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, but it didn't come right away. It developed over time.</p>
                <p>The other thing I wanted to mention about the Chinese Communists was the fact
                    that they would take up several issues at a time and would go all out in support
                    of these issues.</p>
                <p>For example, if they were trying to stop dealing on the black market for silver
                    dollars, they would make numerous speeches saying it was sinful to deal on the
                    black market. They would write articles in the newspapers; children in the
                    schools would sing songs about the sins of dealing in the black market. “Leaning
                    to one side” became one of their slogans. Everything had to lean to one side.
                    They would carry it to extremes in their parades by leaning with one
                    shoulder...physically leaning to the left as they marched. Another slogan was
                    “two steps forward, one step back.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is an old Leninist Communist slogan. Two steps forward, one step
                    back. In other words every once in a while something might not work out, but
                    then they would move forward even more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A great way to excuse your mistakes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yeah. Again in their parade marches their drums would beat, dum, dum,
                    boom; dum, dum, boom. You could see the people marching going two steps forward
                    and then actually taking one step back, then two steps forward again and so on.
                    It became a kind of dance.</p>
                <p>Another policy aim, of course, was to go across to Taiwan, defeat the Nationalist
                    forces and capture the “running dog,” Chiang Kai-shek. Little kindergarten kids
                    instead of playing ring-around-the-rosy, performed little skits about rowing
                    across the straits, catching Chiang Kai-shek, and then pretending to beat up the
                    child playing the part of Chiang with pillows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, yet they never did it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, they never did it. But that was still one of their aims at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened commercially? Did stores stay open, was food
                        available?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: The economic situation in Shanghai had become deplorable during the last
                    months of the Nationalists' regime. Inflation was just terrible. The rate would
                    go from say one million yuan to one American dollar one day, to two million to
                    one the next day. At one time Chiang Kai-shek put his son Chiang Ching-kuo in
                    charge of Shanghai. Ching-kuo put in a new exchange rate and forced everybody to
                    turnover gold in exchange for this new currency. He shot a couple of reputable
                    businessmen who patronized the black market in currency. Of course by doing that
                    it meant that nobody could buy anything in Shanghai because the shelves were
                    empty since merchants could get more money by selling their products outside the
                    city at black market rates than inside at the official rate. Eventually Chiang
                    Ching-kuo was forced to lift the limits on the currency and inflation zoomed
                    again.</p>
                <p>When the Communists came in they tied the currency to the price at any one time
                    of basic commodities...rice, cotton, tobacco and gold. So if you put a certain
                    amount of money in the bank on a given day, you were credited with the amount of
                    rice, cotton, etc. that that original amount of money could buy. So no matter
                    what happened to the actual currency exchange rate you could always get the same
                    quantity of the basic commodities as you were credited with when you had
                    originally deposited. That pretty well did away with inflation within a very
                    short time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the smarter things that I have ever heard
                        doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, I often wonder why we don't do something like it? Of course our
                    inflation rate has never been that high.</p>
                <p>During the period of inflation we used to call home in the U.S. at the beginning
                    of the month. The bill would be equivalent of say U.S. $35 in Chinese currency.
                    We would actually pay the bill at the end of the month. By that time the bill
                    was only equal to about 35 cents.</p>
                <p>Another thing the Communists did. They put a severe tax on all vehicles. So if
                    you owned a car you were expected to pay something along the lines of $50 per
                    month tax on that car. This doesn't sound too unreasonable today, but back when
                    a vice consul's salary was something like $4000 a year, it was a heavy sum. So
                    we sent our car home as did most other people and had to take pedicabs.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>That really was one of the best things we ever did because we saw more of
                    Shanghai that way than we ever would have seen in a car. In those days I think
                    the Foreign Service spent a great deal of time dealing with other officials,
                    driving in cars and living with the upper crust with very little idea of how the
                    peasants, the poor, the lower classes lived. We used to take walks outside
                    Shanghai and into the villages but there was very little Peace Corps-type
                    community activity, which now I think every young Foreign Service officer
                    probably does without thinking twice about it. We used to do that later at our
                    African posts. But in our days in China we dealt mainly with the people who
                    could give us the information we wanted and didn't worry too much about
                    wandering about in the villages. And, of course, we couldn't; with the Communist
                    war going on we couldn't travel very far beyond city limits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Communists make any efforts to keep you from
                        contact with the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, I don't think they made any conscious efforts but the mere fact that
                    we no longer had access to cars except the official cars which took us to work,
                    meant that we just couldn't...and we weren't allowed to travel. We had to have
                    permission for any travel. The war was still going on in the south and we
                    couldn't go down there and there was no point going out west. It was just a time
                    when we were very severely limited as to where we could go, so that inhibited
                    our contacts. And, of course, many of our contacts were afraid to come to us
                    because they were afraid that something would happen to them. And many of our
                    contacts were genuinely trying to get along with the new government, so they
                    wouldn't have phoned us. They began to accuse us of the same things the
                    government was accusing us of doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were probably having to go to these political
                        training classes and learning what to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, a lot of them were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the men in the street, the peasant class, did
                        they seem to welcome this new government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think anything was better for most of them than what they had under
                    the Nationalist government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Except nothing did become better for them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I don't know that I could dogmatically say that. I think probably
                    economically they were better off in some ways. China was not Europe; its
                    average standard of living was much worse than Europe's. The average person in
                    China was poor. There certainly were many poor in the cities. In Shanghai after
                    a typical winter's night the authorities collected bodies off the street of
                    people who had to sleep out and had frozen to death. We saw a bundle in the
                    street outside our house one time coming back from a walk. Our dog started
                    sniffing at it. I went over to see what it was. It was a dead baby. The watchman
                    at our place said it was probably a baby girl that the poor family had not
                    wanted and had thrown out on the street.</p>
                <p>There were wealthy businessmen who did very well under the Nationalists, but the
                    man in the street didn't. So I can't say dogmatically that the peasants were
                    worse off under the Communists. They were worse off in the sense that their
                    lives were controlled; they had to obey regulations and couldn't do what they
                    wanted to do, but they couldn't do everything they wished under the Nationalists
                    either. Don't forget Chiang Kai-shek's KMT party structure was very similar to
                    the Communist Party structure. Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang's son, was trained in
                    Moscow. The people who were affected adversely under the Communists, of course,
                    were those who had money and owned land.</p>
                <p>In the early months it wasn't all that bad for us personally. We were not treated
                    the way we felt we should be as American consular representatives, but we
                    weren't harmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was food.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: There was food. I know that soon after we left the beggars were disposed
                    of in some way. They just disappeared from the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only was there bombing of the harbor during that time
                        you mention, but also any number of factories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I wouldn't put too much stress on the bombing, it didn't amount to very
                    much. It wasn't nearly as severe as the shelling just before the city fell, for
                    example, although the Communists didn't have any planes so there was no bombing
                    from the sky. After Shanghai fell to the Communists, the Nationalists sent over
                    a few planes periodically to drop a few bombs. But we used to go down to the
                    coffee bar in the basement of our Consulate office and use that as our bomb
                    shelter when the sirens went off. Sometimes we would be upstairs and a plane
                    would appear without a warning siren. On one such occasion, I watched a
                    Nationalist plane bombard and sink a vessel in the river.</p>

                <p>Carrying on about what life was like under the Communists, there wasn't very much
                    in the way of entertainment, but there were a few Chinese operas we could watch.
                    One of the good things that I can still remember was seeing one of the most
                    famous old Chinese actors, Mai Lan-fang. He was in his declining years as an
                    actor, in his late fifties, I guess. In traditional Chinese opera the female
                    parts were taken by men and Mai Lan-fang was one of the most famous of all
                    female impersonators. We saw him twice. He really put on a tremendous
                    performance. He was graceful slender, made up to look like a woman, sang in a
                    high falsetto, had all the stylized gestures that actors have in Chinese opera.
                    The only trouble was that whenever he turned his profile you could see that he
                    had at least two or maybe three double chins. That was the only sign of age.</p>
                <p>Another thing we did for entertainment...there were a number of refugee
                    musicians—White Russians, German Jews, etc. In particular there were two Czech
                    brothers who played the cello and the first violin, a Chinese female pianist who
                    was very, very good, and an old White Russian violist. Walter McConaughy was a
                    very accomplished clarinetist. Our hosts, the Abrahams, were Iraqi Jews who had
                    made a small fortune as merchants in Shanghai. They used to have, I think once a
                    week, chamber music sessions where people like us attended and played Beethoven,
                    Mozart, Bach. Sometimes they would invite others in and play octets. That was
                    very soul satisfying.</p>
                <p>The rest of the entertainment was done by ourselves. We had parties, played
                    bridge...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to the race course I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: We did, but we went to the race course to play softball. I never saw a
                    horse race in Shanghai. But I did play a lot of softball.</p>
                <p>Oh, another thing we did...there was an American Club and a British Country Club.
                    These combined forces after the Communists came in. The British Country Club was
                    used in the winter because it had an indoor pool and various other indoor
                    recreational activities. The American Club was used in the summer. The British
                    would come out and join us. We had the usual contests in softball where the
                    British played our game, and then we would play the British in cricket. I
                    remember the cricket game particularly because the British came to bat first and
                    hit the ball very far, but they didn't realize that as baseball players we
                    Americans knew how to catch, so we caught all their long balls. They made only
                    about five runs. We made about fifteen and won the first innings. But in the
                    second innings the British had learned from their experience, kept the ball on
                    the ground and made about 200 runs while we continued to make about fifteen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a golf course anywhere around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: There was, but I didn't play golf in those days. I did a lot of swimming
                    in the American Club outdoor pool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder who laid out the golf course? How long had it
                        been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I have no idea. I seem to remember that there was a golf course in the
                    race course grounds. But I may be thinking of something else. But at any rate I
                    didn't play golf. I have played golf since but not at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just stays in my mind because I remember a diplomat who
                        also had done a lot out in the Far East and was with us in Bucharest in the
                        fifties and we had this little six hole golf course left over. The
                        Communists had been persuaded to leave six holes of King Carol's eighteen
                        holes. This diplomat used to say that this was the last golf course going
                        East until you get to Shanghai. So that is why I ask, there must have been a
                        golf course in Shanghai.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: One of the other things I might mention is that we lived quite
                    remarkably well for a few months in Shanghai after the Communists took over
                    because we had quite a large number of houses that we had acquired...German
                    property that we had taken over after the war. We wanted to maintain these
                    houses so a number of us who had been living in an apartment building were
                    awarded houses. I got Ruben Thomas's house, he was the administrative officer
                    who had left by this time. A delightful house out on what we called Amherst
                    Avenue. It had lovely furniture, a walled yard, just a very nice comfortable
                    house with a fireplace in each bedroom, central heating, etc. All officers had
                    comparable quarters for several months. Then as the time approached for us to
                    leave, and as things began to get dicier and less pleasant, we were all brought
                    together so that we could be taken out more easily. We were collected into an
                    apartment house owned by the Consulate General. That was all right too but not
                    nearly as elegant as our Amherst Avenue dwelling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get your personal belongings shipped out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, we shipped them out when we left Hamilton House, the first
                    apartment house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So ships were still coming in at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, they were, but they had to run the Nationalist blockade. We thought
                    we were very clever, and I guess we were, because we used a Soviet packing
                    company. We figured that it would be more likely to be able to get our stuff out
                    than an American company, although I don't think there was one there at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder why there was a Soviet one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, this was owned by a Russian and Russian firms were beginning to
                    come into evidence in Shanghai. There had been a Soviet Consulate General there
                    even under the Nationalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had diplomatic relations with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I think they still had some relations with the Nationalist
                    government because I can remember one of the Soviet military attach�s joshing
                    Fern Cavender. Anyway, we used this Soviet packer. He packed up our belongings
                    which didn't amount to very much in those days...mainly books. They were shipped
                    out to Saigon which was our next post. We had hoped to be sent home on leave
                    after Shanghai because we were all pretty tired out from being under
                    considerable tension and working long hours. But we were assigned to Saigon. In
                    fact, we were assigned to Saigon and ordered to leave at once at a time when
                    there was no way any of us could get out of Shanghai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that the Department was just unaware of what you
                        were going through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think certain clerks in the Personnel Section were told that I was
                    being assigned to Saigon, so they went through process B and then sent the usual
                    form cable. We still had some cables coming in through U.S. Naval ships that
                    were still anchored outside Shanghai and able to relay them to us. This was
                    about six months before we got out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until when could you keep cable traffic to the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: The Navy kept a ship offshore and we had our communications for quite a
                    while, perhaps several months, after the Communists came in. One day we saw a
                    police car and a bunch of soldiers in a truck approach the Consulate
                    General...(We had already destroyed virtually all our files except the ones that
                    we needed for our daily work. We burned stuff that had been in the Shanghai
                    Consulate files for many years, including old narcotics records among others. It
                    took us a couple of days to get rid of them. The neighbors complained because of
                    all the smoke and ashes. Unfortunately, by this time it was too late to ship any
                    of the stuff out. Anyway we still had our code room. We were allowed to send
                    letters to our parents in fifty words or less by cable through the Navy
                    services.)</p>
                <p>We saw this car pulling up and knew at once that the police were coming in to
                    close our code room. At that time we didn't know how far they were going to go.
                    So I went up on the roof where we had an incinerator and took all the classified
                    files left and burned them. As it turned out they didn't impound our documents,
                    they just put a seal on the code room. So that pretty well shut us down. From
                    then on we sent letters out whenever we could get them on a ship or whenever
                    anybody left the place, in any way we could. Sometimes we tried the open mail
                    and strangely enough most of our letters apparently got home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you had no communications with the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: It seems to me we had people in Canton which was still open and we were
                    able to get some stuff to them. But I just don't know how we did it after the
                    code room closed. I don't think couriers were coming in. It may be that the
                    Department just telegraphed through open wires and we did the same.</p>
                <p>I remember at one point officers had to take turns sleeping in the code room for
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We now move on to the period of 1951-53 when he was Consul
                        and Principal Officer in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. When did you arrive in
                        Malaya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I arrived in April, 1951. I was sent first to Singapore because
                    Kuala Lumpur was a subsidiary post to Singapore, the Consulate General there.
                    This was a somewhat strange situation because while the Singapore Consul General
                    was my immediate supervisor, I was instructed to report directly to the
                    Department and simply send Singapore copies of what I produced. This led to all
                    sorts of problems because the Acting Consul General at Singapore was under the
                    sway, or listened very closely to Malcolm MacDonald who was the British
                    Commissioner General for the whole area. He had very pronounced views on what
                    was going on in the Federation of Malaya. I, however, was under the High
                    Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya who was actively engaged in the very
                    things that Malcolm MacDonald was also covering but had a very different view of
                    these matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Anyway, I stopped off in Singapore and was assigned first to attend as U.S.
                    observer a regional rice conference there sponsored by the British. I did this
                    for about a week and reported on it. Bob Huffman was Economic Officer in
                    Singapore and he was an observer along with me. We wrote a long despatch on it.
                    The conference was highly interesting. I had known nothing about rice, but I
                    learned a lot and came to realize how important rice was to the countries
                    represented at the conference. For example, the Ceylonese representative would
                    try to figure out how much rice India wanted to import. He wanted to be sure
                    they didn't import so much that his country wouldn't be able to get what it
                    needed. There was quite a bit of bargaining and negotiating.</p>
                <p>When the conference was over I prepared to go up to Kuala Lumpur. Those of you
                    who were in the Foreign Service, may recall that at one time informational
                    material on what the Foreign Service was like used to say, “Now you may be
                    posted to London, Paris or Rome, but you also may be assigned to Kuala Lumpur.”
                    Well, I was assigned to Kuala Lumpur and at the time was not at all happy about
                    it; I wanted to go to Vienna. Needless to say my wants were not paid attention
                    to and I ended up in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
                <p>This had been a very small post, opened, if I remember correctly, by Bill Blue
                    four or five years earlier, possibly around 1947. Dick Poole was my immediate
                    predecessor there. He and his whole staff lived in one house which was also the
                    Consulate office. It was on Ampang Road, right next to tin tailings and an open
                    pit tin mine. A nice old house with four large bedrooms upstairs, it was
                    completely open with only shutters to keep out the elements. We slept under
                    mosquito netting. Larry Nichols was the public affairs officer and was in one
                    room with his wife and a young daughter. One of the clerks was in another room
                    and another clerk in the third room. Dick Poole himself was in the fourth
                    bedroom. The office took up all the downstairs except for the dining room.</p>
                <p>Dick Poole asked me if I would mind if he left his seven dogs with me. All of
                    them except one were of the female gender and able to breed, which they did
                    regularly. I said, “No, please get rid of them.” He tried and got rid of about
                    three of them, but there were four left and I eventually ended up by keeping
                    three of the four. Then I got rid of another one and retained two, including the
                    one male. The female bred several times to our dismay, although I tried to keep
                    her from doing so. So we ended up with a third dog, one of her puppies.</p>
                <p>It was an impossible situation because here was this whole small group jammed
                    together, all of them living right on top of each other and working in the same
                    building. I protested vehemently before I went out there and finally got the
                    Department to agree that Anne, who was expecting our first child, and I would
                    have the house to ourselves. They were planning to move the office down town
                    anyway, which they did a few weeks after I got there. We found much more
                    suitable housing for the secretaries, clerks and the USIS head.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The new office was in what was called the Loke Yew building. The Loke Yew
                    building was the skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur. It was seven stories high and far
                    and away the tallest building in the place. Now, I understand, nobody knows
                    where it is and there are dozens of buildings that are at least three or four
                    times taller. But in those days it was the giant. It was right beside the river
                    from which Kuala Lumpur got its name. I think it means something like “muddy
                    confluence of rivers.” Two rivers met forming one river just at that point and
                    there was a mosque right in the angle of the Y.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the names of those rivers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I would have to look that up.</p>
                <p>This was in the pre air conditioning days. The only concession we made to the hot
                    sun was to have tinted windows. But I remember that in those days we were much
                    more formal in our working habits than the Foreign Service is today. We all wore
                    suits and ties. Sometimes we would take our jackets off, but I perspired through
                    at least three suits a day, especially if I went out in the evening. It was
                    very, very humid. The heat was perhaps in the 85-90 range, but the humidity must
                    have been close to 100 percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Kuala Lumpur close to sea level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I think so, yes. There are hills around it but it is almost at sea
                    level. There is a spine of mountains that goes down the center of the Malayan
                    Peninsula, but Kuala Lumpur was not very high up.</p>
                <p>The reason that I think of Kuala Lumpur as one of the most interesting posts I
                    have ever had and, perhaps, one of the most important posts as well, is that it
                    was then the scene of the third hottest war or military conflict in the world.
                    The Korean war was going on, next came the Vietnamese conflict, and then you had
                    the Malayan “emergency” which was a very, very troublesome affair for the
                    British.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The Federation of Malaya was then a British dependency. The British High
                    Commissioner was the top man. He had been faced since 1948 with a communist
                    insurrection which had been started by Communist Chinese who were holed up in
                    the jungles of Malaya. For years they made the life of the British and the
                    Malays miserable. There weren't very many of them. I think during the period I
                    was there, there were some 2000 or 2500 Communist Party members. There was the
                    MRLA or Malayan Races Liberation Army, which numbered about 4000. Then there was
                    a group of from 10,000-30,000 called the Min Yuen comprising the supporting
                    infrastructure which gave the MRLA and the Communist Party their provisions. The
                    Min Yuen was the “water in which the fish swam,” to use Mao's famous metaphor.
                    In other words at the most there were 4000 or 5000 fighting guerrillas. These
                    managed to keep something on the order of 150,000 to 200,000 armed forces busy
                    until the mid-fifties, long after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These forces were British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, there were some British, about 25,000. There were another 25,000
                    from other countries in the British Commonwealth like Fiji Islands, South
                    Africa, etc. Then there were about 50,000 police and 50,000 militia and say
                    another 50,000-60,000 in what was called the home guard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And those were Malayans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes of one sort or another, mostly Malays. The Communist guerrillas were
                    surely 98 percent Chinese. They had what they called a “Malay” regiment
                    stationed somewhere but these regiments were the size of battalions at the
                    most...500 men, let's say. I don't think there were that many Malay communists.
                    This was a Chinese movement and one reason why it never succeeded. It eventually
                    failed because the majority of population did not support the communists. There
                    are more Malays in Malaya than Chinese, not many more but about two and a half
                    million Malays, to about two million Chinese and then another 500,000-600,000
                    Indians, Ceylonese and indigenous people. The Malays were always on the side of
                    the British, so what little support the communists had, had to come from the
                    Chinese community. Most of the Chinese community was pro-Nationalist China and
                    supporters of Chiang Kai-shek. Many of them were businessmen and the city
                    Chinese were certainly overwhelmingly pro-Nationalist and anti-Communist. So
                    there wasn't very much support in the country for these guerrillas.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>But the one thing they had going for them was the environment. They knew how to
                    operate in the jungle. They had been trained to fight the Japanese...the British
                    had helped train some of them. They made their camps deep in these jungles or
                    rain forests. Malaya was in those days at least 80 percent covered by dense
                    forests. For example, a plane flying over the forests would spot the trickle of
                    smoke coming out of the trees and would assume that down there was some kind of
                    a guerrilla camp. This would be about 20 miles from Kuala Lumpur, let's say. The
                    plane would go back and report the location and a detachment of troops would be
                    sent out to get to the camp. They would get there about two weeks later because
                    of the difficulty of hacking their way through the jungle and by that time the
                    camp would be empty. So finding the guerrillas was very difficult and required a
                    very strong intelligence effort on the part of the British. They had to be quite
                    innovative in order to smoke these people out. Some of the tactics they adopted
                    were used by us and the French in Vietnam in succeeding years.</p>
                <p>The High Commissioner when I got there was a gentleman by the name of Sir Henry
                    Gurney. A very fine gentleman. Very, very helpful. He told me when I called on
                    him the first time, “Anything you want from us we will give you. Any information
                    we have you may have.” And he was as good as his word. I had weekly meetings
                    with one of his assistants who would pass official reports over to me which I
                    would take back to my office and use in my own reports to Washington. At that
                    time I think we had just about as much information on military operations as
                    there was to get. What the British knew, we knew. I don't mean every last
                    intelligence operation and that sort of thing, but I think they were very
                    forthcoming. Sir Henry himself certainly was very cooperative.</p>
                <p>The security situation in Kuala Lumpur was rather sensitive. In fact, when I was
                    in Singapore, Bill Langdon, who was then Consul General, offered to sell me one
                    of his Mauser pistols. He said I would need it because every time I went outside
                    Kuala Lumpur I should be armed. I bought this thing and have been saddled with
                    it ever since. I have never used it or fired it in anger. In fact, I never
                    carried it anywhere. But I also had a .38 caliber police positive which I did
                    carry with me on occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a police positive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: A police positive is a .38 caliber, short muzzled revolver, what the
                    police used to carry in those days. A six shot revolver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that dangerous on the street?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes. Well, not so much on the city streets, but if you went into the
                    bush or forest outside the town. I didn't carry it everywhere I went, only
                    whenever I went out on an expedition of some sort. There was one place you could
                    go safely by car and that was Port Swettenham which was the seaport on the west
                    coast about an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur. You could also drive up to
                    Frazer's Hill, which was in the mountains. It was a resort which people went to
                    to escape the heat. Indeed when you went there you found yourself in a little
                    bit of merry old England. Lovely cottages with beautiful flowers. It was about
                    70 degrees rather than 85, dry, and went down to say 60 at night. It was really
                    a wonderful change. There was afternoon tea and a log fire in the fireplace even
                    though it was a bit too warm for that.</p>
                <p>Apart from those two places, anywhere you went...when you went out to the tin
                    mines or to the rubber plantations...you always made sure that you were armed
                    and that nobody knew you were going...that you didn't tell anyone by telephone.
                    If you went out into the countryside you were usually required to have a
                    military escort of some sort.</p>
                <p>In fact, my predecessor one time was sleeping soundly in his house when shots
                    rang out right on Ampang Road. He got up and remembered he had locked his
                    revolver in the office safe, so he made his way downstairs in the dark and
                    managed to open the safe and get his gun out. But by that time everything was
                    all over. It turned out that one of the guards had had a nightmare or something
                    like that and had shot off his rifle. The other guards heard his shot and fired
                    off in all directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These 4000 or so guerrillas were able to harass this whole
                        huge country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. It wasn't so much actual harassment as the knowledge that they
                    could do so if they wished.</p>
                <p>They permeated the place. They were down in Johore in the southern part, in
                    Malacca, Selangor, everywhere except the main cities. They didn't thrive in the
                    cities and as far as we know they didn't have much support in the cities. But
                    they did terrorize the rubber tappers, the villagers...I'll go into this a
                    little bit later.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>But I wanted to mention the security aspect because it was brought home to us
                    with shocking clarity one day in early October when we heard the rumor that Sir
                    Henry Gurney had been assassinated. It turned out to be true. He had been
                    ambushed on his way to Frazer's Hill. It was determined that the people in the
                    ambush knew, probably by tapping his telephone, he was coming up there because
                    they were hidden around a certain bend in the road and several vehicles were
                    allowed to go through without harassment. They knew exactly when and where Sir
                    Henry Gurney's vehicle would be. I think he always had two military vehicles
                    accompany him. One of them had to stop for some reason or other. I have
                    forgotten whether it broke down or whether there was an obstruction on the road.
                    The other one, the leading one, went through the ambush and then the ambush
                    closed in on Sir Henry Gurney. They started firing. He had his wife with him and
                    told her to get down on the floor. Then he left the car to draw fire away from
                    her—I have no doubt that he tried to do this because he was a very courageous
                    and honorable gentleman. They got him. He died in a ditch. If he had stayed in
                    the car, according to the police chief at that time, he probably would have
                    survived.</p>
                <p>So that was a shocker to all of us. His place was eventually taken by Sir Gerald
                    Templar, who I will have quite a bit to say about later on.</p>
                <p>What I want to say about Gurney is that he and his director of operations, Sir
                    Harold Briggs, were responsible for some very farsighted and interesting
                    policies that were over a long period of time expected to win this guerrilla
                    war. Briefly, the Briggs plan was to get the Chinese squatters...well I guess I
                    have to go back a bit.</p>
                <p>The Chinese entered this country about 70 years before this, mainly as
                    businessmen or as tin miners. A lot of them came in and as the mines wore out
                    they became squatters on land all throughout the peninsula. These squatters were
                    the main people from whom the Min Yuen got their recruits and from which the
                    MRLA got their supplies. These people had no protection, it was very difficult
                    with them squatting all over the place. So the Briggs plan in brief was to bring
                    them into areas that would be fortified. They would be given houses, there would
                    be schools and they would be protected by armed guards.</p>
                <p>This eventually became the strategic hamlet program in Vietnam. Sir Robert
                    Thompson, the famous expert who advised our people in Vietnam, was the man who
                    actually drew this up for Sir Harold Briggs and Sir Henry Gurney.</p>
                <p>After Gurney was assassinated, Sir Gerald Templar came in and applied muscle to
                    this whole policy and drove it through to a successful conclusion. Sir Harold
                    Briggs left shortly after Sir Henry Gurney was assassinated and his place was
                    taken by Sir Rob Lockhart, who had been the international head of the Boy
                    Scouts, among other things.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>While Sir Harold Briggs was in effect the brains and muscle behind the Gurney
                    policy, Sir Rob Lockhart was completely eclipsed by Sir Gerald Templar, Sir
                    Henry's successor. Sir Gerald Templar was really quite a remarkable man, one of
                    the most remarkable I have been associated with. He was a former hurdler, a
                    slender person. He had been head of British military intelligence, I believe. He
                    had been one of the youngest full generals in World War II and had been the only
                    general to have been wounded by a piano.</p>
                <p>He was riding in his staff car and there was a truck in front of him carrying a
                    piano. The truck rode over a mine and the piano went up in the air and came down
                    on top of poor Sir Gerald Templar. As a result he always had trouble with his
                    back. He wasn't crippled, but he was rather physically frail. But spiritually,
                    very strong. He was very outspoken, lavish in his use of profanity, and quite an
                    interesting person in every respect.</p>
                <p>I remember him telling me at one point that he should have been born in the 18th
                    or 19th century. He said, “If indeed I had been born at that time, the first
                    thing I would do would be to invade Siam, and the second thing I would do would
                    be to invade Singapore and take over Phoenix Park.”</p>
                <p>A little explanation of this. The communist guerrillas had safe havens in
                    Thailand. When things got too hot for them in the Federation, they would just
                    disappear over the border and go to their safe havens in the jungles of
                    Thailand. So you just couldn't put your fingers on them. First of all they were
                    dispersed and secondly, even if you knew where they were, they were much more
                    mobile than the British forces so they couldn't really get at them. Thailand did
                    not look kindly on hot pursuit or anything like that, so Sir Gerald was always
                    having trouble with Thailand.</p>
                <p>Phoenix Park in Singapore was Malcolm MacDonald's headquarters. MacDonald was on
                    a completely different track from Sir Gerald Templar. The son of former Labor
                    Prime Minister Ramsey MacDonald, he was a liberal, a very nice man. He was very
                    much interested in the Chinese and had very good Chinese contacts in Singapore
                    from whom he was getting a pro-Chinese point of view. Not the point of view of
                    the communist guerrillas, but that of the Chinese merchants. Sir Gerald Templar
                    had little patience with any Chinese. He wanted them to shape up or ship out.
                    Every time Malcolm MacDonald had suggestions as to how one should be careful
                    about Chinese sensitivities, etc., Templar would gnash his teeth, dig in and do
                    what he darn well pleased anyway. The two weren't actually hostile to each
                    other, but they were just thinking along different lines. Templar was a
                    pragmatist and military man and he wanted to wind up the guerrilla war quickly.
                    He was going to protect people and force them into these new villages and make
                    sure they went there whether they wanted to or not. He had little patience for
                    Malcolm MacDonald's liberal, anthropological approach.</p>

                <p>VAN OSS: I will have to count it up. It was a pretty small office. I had a young
                    Vice Consul named David Dean, who was consular officer, and deputy political
                    reporter. Kuala Lumpur was his first post and he later went on to fame and
                    fortune and became head of our mission responsible for relations with Taiwan
                    after we recognized Communist China. My economic officer was first Bob Myer and
                    then Dick Peters. We had a political attach� named Bob Wall. We had two
                    secretaries and a code clerk. The head of USIS was Larry Nichols and later Jack
                    Gertz who had a deputy, whose name I can't remember at this point. Then we had
                    an administrative officer. There were about eight or ten local employees.</p>
                <p>The office, itself, was certainly adequate. We had a security area where only
                    Americans were allowed to be because even in those days we were very security
                    conscious. At one time at Bob Wall's urging, I ordered some carbines so that
                    when and if we ever had to evacuate our post we would have a means of protecting
                    ourselves. As you know all offices in those days had to have an evacuation plan
                    and we had one. Unfortunately, the Department or somebody went overboard and we
                    found ourselves the proud possessors of no less than sixteen carbines, all of
                    them packed up in some foul smelling grease. Under Bob Wall's tuition, because
                    he was the only one, I think, who knew anything about weaponry, we locked all
                    the doors, pulled the blinds, because no one was supposed to know we had these
                    carbines, and started to clean them up. I think we got through four and by that
                    time I was thoroughly sick and tired of the whole business. We all stank of this
                    oil, our clothes were ruined. I called a halt and said that we would keep twelve
                    as they were and use the four we had cleaned. After all there were probably only
                    four of us who could shoot anyway.</p>
                <p>We were on the third floor, but my memory may be faulty there, and the USIS was
                    downstairs on the second floor. The work that we did...I was delighted with this
                    post because I could get up in the morning and say to myself, “What am I going
                    to do today? Shall I cover the guerrilla emergency? Shall I go down and get
                    briefed by the military? Shall I go downtown and talk to some of my Chinese and
                    Malay contacts?” It was like an embassy in microcosm. It had everything that an
                    embassy had except that there wasn't as much of it. I just was happy to be in
                    charge and responsible for what was going on.</p>
                <p>We did a lot of economic reporting. Malaya in those days exported tin and rubber
                    to the United States. These were their main exports. They also had palm oil and
                    the usual other tropical products. But those two were far and away their main
                    products. Kuala Lumpur itself was right in the middle of important tin mining
                    operations. We had a fair sized American community...several dozen at least.
                    They were largely concerned with tin mining.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Pacific Tin Company had its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Norman Cleaveland was
                    its President and Managing Director. He became a very close friend, was a great
                    fellow. Eventually he wrote a book called “Bang, Bang In Ampang,” in which he
                    was kind enough to mention me once or twice. He had a big gold dredge outside of
                    Kuala Lumpur which was working a tin mine. He had about a half a dozen Americans
                    working for him and I was close to all of them.</p>
                <p>We also had an American engineer on the east coast in the Kuantan area of Pahang.
                    There was a big iron mountain there and he was in charge of the mining
                    operation.</p>
                <p>There were some American missionaries in Kuala Lumpur. One was a fellow named
                    Gunner Theilman, who was a Methodist minister, a very fine fellow. He didn't
                    drink or smoke, of course. But he was extremely kind and nice. And there were
                    several other Americans attached to his mission. I would suppose there were
                    several dozen Americans in all.</p>
                <p>One of the first things we had to do when we first arrived was to throw a July
                    Fourth party. This was 1951 and the 175th anniversary of American independence
                    was being celebrated. Our party was a big one by our standards, with something
                    like 300 guests. Anne was pregnant at the time and had to stand in the receiving
                    line to greet all the guests as they came in. That was the first social event
                    that we hosted. There was a very thriving social life, lots of entertaining to
                    do. There were contacts to have lunch with. Lots of people were inviting us
                    over. A typical Foreign Service post where you are on duty literally twenty-four
                    hours a day. You get very little sleep. That, plus the heat, plus the fact that
                    there was no air conditioning at all, and that the monsoons leach vitamins out
                    of food, made all of us get physically run-down and lose weight. It was both
                    physically and mentally wearing. I suppose the fact that we were constantly
                    worried about security matters too, had something to do with the tension we were
                    under.</p>
                <p>There was always a great deal to report. We also had many visitors, important
                    visitors. We had, for example, at one time Justice Douglas. This was quite
                    amusing because he arrived and came off the plane (reporters were all out at the
                    airport en masse to meet him) wearing an old fedora hat, a dirty old shirt open
                    halfway down his chest, khaki pants of which one pocket had torn open, and
                    carrying a canvass water bag. In other words he was dressed for the wilds. He
                    was not there on a protocol visit. The reporters looked past him. I recognized
                    him and greeted him. He had a friend with him, Gilbert something. He stayed
                    about a week with us and was a delightful visitor. It is a shame that his last
                    days in the Supreme Court were so unpleasant because when I saw him in Malaya in
                    1952, he was all man, vigorous and interested in everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>One interesting anecdote: when Sir Gerald Templar heard Justice Douglas was in
                    town, he invited him to dinner. I said, “Yes, I am sure he would like to come,
                    but I don't think he will have brought his tuxedo with him.” (All dinners at
                    King's House were black tie affairs.) Lady Templar said, “Oh, I am sure you
                    could find something for him.” I said, “Well, I probably could, but I am not
                    sure he would be terribly happy about wearing somebody else's tuxedo, but I will
                    try.” So I did try. He had a pair of dark pants and I found a white dinner
                    jacket and a black tie for him. But we couldn't find black shoes. So we went to
                    the dinner.</p>
                <p>The format at King's House is that all guests assemble downstairs and then at the
                    appropriate moment Sir Gerald and his wife descend the grand stairway and go
                    around and shake hands with each guest. So, as Lady Templar came to...</p>
                <p>[end tape 3]</p>
                <p>...Justice Douglas, her eyes started at his face, then came down to his black
                    tie, white jacket and black trousers. She said, “Ah, I see that you found
                    something and all is well.” He was blushing. Then her eyes fell down to his
                    brown shoes and she did a double take and went on to the next person. He was
                    trying, as he said, to get his shoes under the carpet to hide them.</p>
                <p>One thing that bothered me about that dinner. The guest of honor was Lord
                    Tweedsmuir, who was the son of John Buchan, the author of “The Thirty-Nine
                    Steps.” He was a mere lad in his early twenties. He sat at the Templar's right
                    and Justice Douglas sat way down “behind the salt” opposite me. Justice Douglas
                    had been a presidential candidate and was a Supreme Court Justice, and I thought
                    surely British protocol could have done a little bit better for him. On the
                    other hand he was an unexpected guest so I guess we had to make allowances.
                    Anyway, neither of us said anything or even thought about it at the time.</p>
                <p>We had other guests. We had Thomas Dewey but nothing of great moment happened
                    there, except that he couldn't hear anything when he got off the plane. We had
                    somebody or other Foster, then Under Secretary for Defense. I remember he was
                    supposed to arrive at a certain time to go to lunch at King's House and his
                    plane arrived an hour and a half late coming from Burma or some such place.</p>
                <p>We had John F. Kennedy and Bobby, who had just graduated from law school, and one
                    of their sisters. But the sister never showed up in Kuala Lumpur, I think she
                    stayed in Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they all coming to Kuala Lumpur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, because this was an interesting place. It had the third hottest
                    war as I told you and economically it was very important. Tin and rubber were
                    both very important to us in those post-war periods.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was John Kennedy in Congress at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: He was a Congressman at that time. I am ashamed to say that although
                    John F. Kennedy entered Princeton the same time that I did, spent several months
                    there and lived in the same dormitory that I lived in, I never knew him. I
                    didn't know at the time he came to Malaya that he had ever gone to Princeton. He
                    got some blood disease, perhaps hepatitis I believe, left Princeton after a few
                    months and subsequently went to Harvard. I may say that if I had known he was a
                    classmate, his visit would have been a far more pleasant experience then it
                    turned out to be.</p>
                <p>Adlai Stevenson visited Malaya after he had been defeated in the 1952
                    presidential election. I may interject that all the British wanted Adlai
                    Stevenson to win, even Sir Gerald Templar. He liked and was a great admirer of
                    Ike, but as an intellectually superior person himself, he thought Stevenson's
                    speeches were great stuff and that he would be a much better president than
                    Eisenhower. Stevenson came with Barry Bingham, the head of the Louisville
                    Courier Journal. Anne's parents were great friends of the Binghams and I knew
                    them reasonably well. He came with Bill Attwood, who was then one of the editors
                    of Look magazine and later became Ambassador to Guinea and Kenya. There were
                    several others whom I can't recall.</p>
                <p>I might mention one little episode that gave me a gray hair or two. I had
                    arranged to have Stevenson taken out by helicopter over the jungle so that he
                    could get an idea of what the terrain was like. There were only two operating
                    large helicopters at that time, which we had supplied the British. My boss from
                    Singapore, Chuck Baldwin, was up for the occasion and there was no room for
                    yours truly on either helicopter. So I stayed morosely at home while Adlai and
                    all the others went off on these two helicopters.</p>
                <p>I had been at my desk for a couple of hours when the phone rang. General
                    Templar's aide was on the phone and he said, “Hank, there has been a slight
                    to-do.” I said, “What do you mean, a slight to-do?” “Well there has been a spot
                    of trouble on one of the helicopters.” I began to tense up a bit. I said, “There
                    has been? Which helicopter?” “Oh, I'm not sure,” he said, “Don't panic. I'm sure
                    everything is all right. But as a matter of fact, one of them has gone down.”
                    And I said, “Which one?” I was getting highly excited at this point. He said,
                    “As a matter of fact it is the one with Stevenson on it.” I really began to
                    sweat, wondering where I could find a flag to cover the casket, etc. A few
                    minutes later the aide called again and said, “Nothing to worry about, the other
                    helicopter has landed and taken Adlai Stevenson off. Nobody is hurt, everything
                    is all right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Well, what happened was that the main rotor stopped whirling on Stevenson's
                    helicopter. Its descent was slowed by the tail rotor which was still turning.
                    The pilot with great skill brought his machine down in a small clearing in the
                    jungle and everybody was safe. But boy, I was trying to figure out how I could
                    have explained why I had allowed the Democratic presidential candidate to risk
                    his life in a helicopter in a zone of hostilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without going with him too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Without being there to help him. My boss (Chuck Baldwin) was there to
                    hold his hand.</p>
                <p>The point to all this is that Kuala Lumpur was on the milk run for many prominent
                    people. We did have a number of visitors of one sort or another and that always
                    made for tough work as any Foreign Service officer knows. When you have an
                    important visitor, a Congressman or political figure, you have to do what you
                    can to see that his visit is successful and that takes time. When your
                    facilities and resources are limited that means that you have to do a lot of
                    things yourself. The rest of the work goes on so you have to squeeze them in in
                    some way. So we were very, very busy.</p>
                <p>Another man I might mention was Donald MacGillivray, the Deputy High Commissioner
                    under Templar. When I first saw him I thought, dear me, here is the epitome of
                    the British public school, wimp-type Britisher. He was thin with a prominent
                    Adam's apple and looked as though a breath of air would blow him over. But I
                    couldn't have been more wrong. He turned out to be a very fine person. He
                    supplied the human touch that Sir Gerald Templar had but kept under wraps.</p>
                <p>He was the one who did most of the traveling throughout the peninsula. He was
                    kind enough to take me along with him on several occasions. Otherwise it would
                    have been very difficult for me to get to some places. Everything was laid on
                    for him, and I just piggy-backed along and saw a lot of things that I otherwise
                    might have had great difficulty seeing. We visited a number of rubber
                    plantations. We stayed in a Malaya Kampol. The Malays often lived in houses on
                    stilts. They built their houses up off the ground so that air could circulate
                    and domesticated animals were kept underneath. We spent a night or two in one of
                    those. We visited the British advisers in the various Malay principalities.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I might point out now at this point that the Federation of Malaya consisted of
                    nine Sultanic states and two settlements: Penang and Malacca. The nine Sultanic
                    states were ruled by sultans. The British had a special arrangement with each
                    sultan who had his own governmental structure, with his own administrators
                    headed by what they called the mentri bazar, who was in effect the prime
                    minister of that particular Sultanic state. The mentri bazar was the man who
                    really ran the state, the sultan was the ceremonial head and ruler, but really
                    didn't have many substantive functions. I would say that the sultan of Johore,
                    if I remember correctly, was somewhat of an exception to that rule. He was a bit
                    more independent and feisty than the others.</p>
                <p>I wanted also to say that the Consulate in Kuala Lumpur was responsible for the
                    southern part of the Malayan Peninsular. I had a Foreign Service colleague in
                    Penang who covered the Sultanic states of Kedah, Perak and Kelantan. I had
                    Selangor, Trengganu, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Johore. I don't know
                    why the distribution was so uneven, but I had a much larger office than he. I
                    think he was the only officer at his post. Larry Lutkins was consul at Penang at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>One thing I probably should start talking about now is the independence movement
                    that was going on in Malaya, which was highly important and has gotten lost in
                    the shuffle in this tape. The British were obviously at that point resigned to
                    the fact that eventually Malaya would become independent. But they wanted to be
                    sure that they would be independent in the image that they envisaged for it and
                    not as a communist satellite. And don't forget that these were days just after
                    China had been taken over by the Communists, North Korea had invaded South
                    Korea, and Ho Chi-Minh and his Viet Minh were fighting the French. The common
                    belief in those days was that the Soviet Comintern had orchestrated all these
                    conflicts and that the Malayan conflict was part of the communist master plan to
                    conquer the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they said it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. We all believed it.</p>
                <p>In any event the British wanted to be sure that this guerrilla insurgency did not
                    succeed. So they conceived this Briggs plan of creating new villages which were
                    established not only for the protection of the squatters but also for their
                    education. It would put them in contact for the first time with schools. There
                    would be medical facilities. It would create a medium for conducting elections
                    and for teaching people the rudiments of democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>But, as always, there were people in Malaya who felt the British weren't moving
                    fast enough. There were a number of Malays and Chinese who felt that Britain
                    should move faster towards giving up its hold over Malaya. Malaya was not a
                    colony, incidentally, the Sultanic states were all protectorates. The only
                    colonies were Penang and Malacca, the two settlements I mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>One very interesting person who was being groomed to lead an independent movement
                    and take over the country was a man named Dato Onn bin Jafaar. Dato Onn had been
                    the head of the United Malay National Organization (UMNO), which was a
                    nationalist Malay movement. No Chinese members. While he was head of UMNO he was
                    very popular. He was a good rabble rouser and potential leader. Also he was a
                    favorite of Malcolm MacDonald who felt that he represented the voice of the
                    future in Malaya.</p>
                <p>The British made a great mistake. They felt they had to bolster Onn's status so
                    they made him, as I recall, minister for home affairs in the government that
                    existed at that time. In other words, they took him out of his role of
                    nationalist leader and made him in effect a British bureaucrat and expected him
                    to keep his leadership and following and remain the political force that he had
                    been up to that time.</p>
                <p>This was a naive thing that the British did constantly at that time. The minute
                    they saw people who they thought were promising political figures whom they
                    approved of, they tried to help them by giving them jobs as administrators, not
                    realizing that although this might have improved their knowledge of how
                    government works, the British were really giving them the “kiss of death.” They
                    were destroying their political base among the masses, who didn't like the
                    British or persons who collaborated with them.</p>
                <p>As a result Dato Onn, who had been moving along up to this point as the British
                    had hoped he would, was compromised with his base of popular Malay support. Part
                    of the British vision was a cooperative venture between Malays and Chinese,
                    because the Malays couldn't run the country alone. They didn't have the drive,
                    or knowledge. They needed the help and support of the Chinese who did have the
                    drive and were the businessmen, the pragmatists.</p>
                <p>At one point Dato Onn resigned or lost the leadership of UMNO. He formed his own
                    party, the Independence of Malaya Party. This was going to be a party which
                    would cooperate with the Chinese and other ethnic groups. The main Chinese
                    honcho of the period was Tan Chen-lok, a wealthy person Malcolm MacDonald had
                    cultivated. Tan did have a great deal of prestige among the Chinese community.
                    But in forming this new party, Dato Onn, in trying to include all the factions
                    in Malaya—the Chinese, Malays, Indians, etc—cut himself loose from the Malays
                    and besides, did not win Tan Chen-lok over. In essence the only people who
                    really supported him were the Indians, a very small minority.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Then the British gave him the final nudge to oblivion by appointing him minister
                    for home affairs and giving him all these administrative duties. To cut a long
                    story short, Dato Onn's image plummeted. He realized this and got crankier and
                    crankier. I saw him many times and he would get madder and madder at life in
                    general. He found himself in a situation that he just couldn't handle, couldn't
                    control.</p>
                <p>Tunku Abdul Rahman, an hereditary Malay prince, took over and was elected head of
                    the United Malay National Organization. The British at first made light of Tunku
                    Abdul Rahman because although he had been well educated he never got very good
                    marks. He managed to get a law degree, but they scoffed at that. Some people
                    considered him rather a clown. I found him a very nice guy. I didn't consider
                    him politically very charismatic at that point, but I am not a Malay and Malays
                    apparently did find him appealing because he became the head of UMNO, eventually
                    formed some affiliation with Tan Chen-lok and the Chinese, and eventually took
                    over as prime minister of Malaya when it got its independence in 1957. He became
                    a tremendous force.</p>
                <p>But at the time I was there this was not at all apparent. One knew he was in
                    charge of UMNO but apart from being an awfully nice person he had not shown all
                    that much political skill.</p>
                <p>The British, as I say, didn't like him, but he was the one who ended up on top
                    and they had to work with him eventually. All the people who became ministers
                    remained bureaucrats. Dato Nik Kamil, for example, was the Mentri Bazar of
                    Kelantan. He was a fine, very intelligent fellow. The British appointed him
                    minister for something or other and he eventually became ambassador to the
                    United States. He had a fine career, but my point is that the British had
                    probably envisaged him as an eventual prime minister and he never quite
                    blossomed into that.</p>
                <p>I want to say something about Norman Cleaveland, the head of Pacific Tin Company.
                    He had been in Malaya for a long time. He had seen, long before the British,
                    that whatever was going on in Malaya was something important and dangerous and
                    something that had to be watched carefully. In the 1947-48 period a gentleman
                    named Gent was the British High Commissioner. When the first evidence of
                    terrorist activity took place, some tin miners, including Norman Cleaveland, and
                    some rubber plantation owners came to Gent and said that something had to be
                    done. He said, “Are you gentleman sure that you are treating your laborers
                    properly?” He thought the guerrilla uprising was just a labor movement.</p>
                <p>Well, Norman Cleaveland lost patience, chartered a large plane, bought weapons I
                    think with his own money, flew them in and armed his miners. As a result they
                    survived and were not taken over or run over by the guerrillas. Sir Gent was
                    replaced by Sir Henry Gurney, who knew very well what was going on and who was
                    responsible in the first instance for the policies that eventually Sir Gerald
                    Templar carried through to a successful conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Norman Cleaveland was really a great fellow. He had been in the back field on
                    Ernie Nevers' undefeated football team at Stanford, graduating in 1924. He had
                    been a member of the first and only, up to that point, Olympic U.S. rugby team,
                    going to the Olympics in France. The team eventually won the gold medal.</p>
                <p>Norman's mother was one of the first women ever to go out to New Mexico. She
                    settled in the Sante Fe area and wrote a book, which I think was called, “No
                    Life For A Lady,” which has been very popular, has run through several editions
                    and is still in print. He, himself, was a bachelor when we knew him in Malaya,
                    in his late 40s. He had gained fame there by rescuing some young lady who got
                    caught on a field by a Brahman bull. He rushed over to the bull, grabbed it by
                    the horns and wrestled it to the ground in true cowboy style, a technique he had
                    learned in Santa Fe, having grown up in the far West.</p>
                <p>He was a great admirer of Herbert Hoover, which will give you some idea of his
                    political inclinations. I used to consider myself somewhat of a liberal in those
                    days. We used to have great arguments. He used to take me on pig hunts. We would
                    go out early in the morning from Kuala Lumpur with a group of other men, dogs
                    and beaters. It was dark. I never could fire a gun accurately and went out just
                    to get the atmosphere, although he made me carry my police positive .38 caliber
                    revolver, just in case.</p>
                <p>We would go into a hiding place in the bush while the beaters were beating up the
                    pigs. Then Norman would get arguing about economic matters and what was wrong
                    with the United States. His pet hate was Democratic Senator Symington because
                    Symington in his Senate Committee in Washington accused the Malayan tin miners
                    of “gouging” the American taxpayer. Of course, the price of tin was indeed high,
                    but these tin miners were mining tin under rather difficult conditions. Tin was
                    in great demand at that point so the price rose. I don't think the tin miners
                    themselves had very much to do with it. Then Senator Lyndon Johnson echoed
                    Symington's sentiments, to Norman's disgust.</p>
                <p>Norman would get riled up over whatever the subject might be and you couldn't get
                    him off the subject of tin, once he got started. So there we would be out in the
                    boondocks of the jungle listening to the beaters in the distance, Norman
                    declaiming what should be done with people like Symington, and a pig would jump
                    out of the bush and run across our path and he would say, “Uh oh, there's a pig.
                    Just a moment.” By the time he got his gun armed, the pig would be gone and he
                    would resume his economic diatribe without a loss of breath.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>He stayed in Malaya quite a long time after we left. How long exactly, I don't
                    know. I think he was there when the country became independent in 1957. To our
                    amazement he got married while there in the late fifties to a girl who was at
                    least 25 years younger than he. I think she was the daughter of a British
                    admiral. They had several daughters. He kept a home in Sante Fe and one in
                    England. At the moment they are separated. He is living in Sante Fe and is a
                    very senior citizen, being in his early nineties. He is still full of fun, as
                    feisty as ever and as conservative as ever. In my opinion he was the best that
                    American enterprise can produce—honest, intelligent and courageous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to talk a little about the Department. How
                        interested was the Department in what was going on and what was your
                        relationship with them? What were their directions to you considering what
                        the British were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: It is a little difficult for me to reconstruct the instructions that I
                    got from them. I think they were pleased with the reporting we were doing and I
                    think I was carrying out my mission. We were there to support the British. There
                    was no question about that. We were to encourage the British in their efforts to
                    lead this country into independence and we were to aid the British tangibly in
                    any way we could.</p>
                <p>One of my bosses was Phil Bonsal, I think he was the director of the Office of
                    South Asian Affairs...he might have been deputy Assistant Secretary also...he
                    came out and we had very cordial relations. While he was there I was a little
                    bit peeved because Sir Gerald Templar asked him for helicopters and Bonsal
                    magnanimously agreed to see what he could do. Even though I was a mere
                    “youngster” at the time I thought that if Sir Gerald really had confidence in me
                    he would have raised the helicopter issue with me so that I could have had a
                    chance to help out. But these are the things that happen.</p>
                <p>As I told you before, we were a subsidiary post to Singapore. I got along very
                    well with Bill Langdon, but he didn't stay long as Consul General. His place was
                    taken by Jack Goodyear, in an acting capacity. Jack felt very strongly that
                    Kuala Lumpur should fit into the Singapore command structure and that I should
                    follow his lead in my political reporting. I had had considerable experience
                    with political reporting in China and in the work I had done in the Department,
                    with biographic intelligence and that sort of thing. Jack had never done
                    political reporting and he was really listening to Malcolm MacDonald. Whenever
                    what I said, reflecting my contacts, went against what he had heard from Malcolm
                    MacDonald, he would pooh-pooh it. He would say, “Well, this isn't right.”</p>
                <p>So we thoroughly irritated each other, although I liked the man and still do, but
                    we didn't work together very well. I had my instructions to report directly to
                    the Department, which I insisted on doing. My reports didn't go through him but
                    I sent him copies of everything I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Then Chuck Baldwin came out as the regular Consul General. He was a much more
                    amenable person and much broader gauged, at least from my point of view. I got
                    along extremely well with him.</p>
                <p>The only bane to my existence was in the USIS activity. The USIS man in Kuala
                    Lumpur had to work under and through the USIS chief in Singapore, even though I
                    had the right to report directly to the Department, he didn't. The USIS head in
                    Singapore was named Elmer Newton, a very nice man but also very feisty, and with
                    his own ideas. He had the impression that USIS was really the organization that
                    carried out U.S. policy. He considered that consuls and consuls general were
                    there to take care of Americans, to give visas, to report on economic matters,
                    maybe military matters, but when it came to carrying out policies it was up to
                    USIS to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he get that idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I suppose from the idea that USIS is a spokesman for American
                    policy and was in charge of cultural exchanges. For example, he took it upon
                    himself to advise the Chinese in my district to beef up their labor union
                    activities. I knew, from my contacts, that this was just asking for trouble. The
                    Chinese Communists were trying to get their foothold in the unions and by
                    beefing them up you were fertilizing the field in which communism might grow. In
                    any event, it was not up to him to make that decision. He could have a hand in
                    it, yes, but this was a policy matter which should have been articulated in the
                    Department and not by him blundering around in what I considered to be my area
                    of responsibility.</p>
                <p>This led to some unpleasant set-tos that he and I had. Nevertheless, I always
                    respected the man. He was good, his heart was in the right place, but he just
                    couldn't stand for what he considered interference by me in things he was doing,
                    when he was really the one who was interfering in my work.</p>
                <p>As far as the Desk people in the Department were concerned, Dick Poole, my
                    predecessor was eventually on the Malaya Desk. We had very cordial relations and
                    as far as I know he was satisfied with what I was producing. Ken Landon was
                    another one back in Washington. Another person who eventually came out to Kuala
                    Lumpur was Oscar Armstrong, a close friend of mine. He was a Chinese language
                    officer who had been stationed in Singapore. The work load in Kuala Lumpur was
                    really very heavy and we were far too small to handle it properly. Also I felt
                    very strongly that...I was only a class 5 officer at the time when class 6 was
                    the bottom rank...my job should have been held by an FSO-3, somebody who could
                    pull rank a little more than I could as a young FSO-5. So I recommended that my
                    successor be a more senior officer, especially if the place was going to become
                    independent, so that he could operate a little more freely and without worrying
                    too much about protocol and having to work with people who greatly outranked
                    him.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>This is not something that preoccupied me to any extent, it was just something
                    that became obvious. The work load was extremely hard. I knew the office would
                    have to grow and that unless the principal officer had a higher ranking it would
                    be very difficult to assign experienced persons there. If my successor was not
                    at least an FSO-3, he would be assigned relatively inexperienced officers under
                    him, and thus wouldn't get the quality personnel I thought the place should
                    have. Anyway, the Department assigned an FSO-2, Eric Kocher to replace me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would be a senior Foreign Service officer
                        today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, and it was in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a number of famous American visitors, did
                        any British royalty come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Not exactly royalty, but royal family yes. The Duchess of Kent, whose
                    husband had died, came and brought the Duke of Kent, heir apparent, with her to
                    attend some celebration. Their visit took a tremendous amount of time on
                    everybody's part, the British especially. This was great stuff for them. They
                    organized everything down to the last second. I can remember being with one of
                    the organizers at some point along the parade route. He looked at his watch and
                    said, “I reckon she will now be getting out of the gate at King's House.” We
                    looked up and indeed her car was just being driven out of the gate at King's
                    House.</p>
                <p>Anne and I were invited to the receptions, and other events. We were given
                    instructions on how our wives should curtsy, but I didn't think it was
                    appropriate for the wife of an American official to curtsy so I suggested to
                    Anne, who didn't want to either, that she simply bow her head as she shook hands
                    to show that she was respectful, without being obsequious. And, indeed, that is
                    what she did. But the wife of one of the British rubber planters, Headly Facer's
                    wife, didn't curtsy as a matter of principle. She, being a British subject, got
                    into hot water. The King's House people noted her act, and she was boycotted.
                    She never went to another reception in the King's House. That shows how the
                    British work.</p>
                <p>And this protocol business was so annoying because all these people, these young
                    officers...I was on good terms with most of them...I used to play water polo
                    with them for example...but at a reception when the Duchess of Kent would come
                    into the room these men would come in and officiously push everyone out of the
                    way and say, “Make way for her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Kent.” They didn't
                    see anything amusing about it at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Speaking of British protocol, this is one of the less pleasant aspects you run
                    into when you are in a British preserve. For example, the British
                    Advisers...each of the Sultanic states had a British Adviser, or Resident. When
                    he would visit the Kampongs and villages carrying out his duties, he would
                    always wear a hat or a necktie. Not because he wanted to, but because this
                    marked him as being different from the “natives.”</p>
                <p>I remember very vividly one trip Anne and I took out to Trengganu, a Sultanic
                    state on the east coast. I might say that Kuala Lumpur was essentially a modern
                    city. It had Malay Muslim type architecture and things of that sort, but had all
                    the conveniences...elevators, electricity, etc. Selangor was a fairly advanced
                    Malay state, but when you went out to the east coast, Trengganu, you went out to
                    Malaya as it always has been. There is where you see Malayan huts on poles to
                    account for the high tide. The moon shines, the waters are sparkling, the women
                    are in sarongs, the men wear their black Malay hats. Very colorful.</p>
                <p>On this particular visit we stayed with the British Resident. I can't remember
                    his name, but I do remember that his wife was a “Lady,” one of noble birth. He
                    was very hospitable. He laid on a venture in which we were to go out in his
                    yacht and motor up the coast, where Malay villages were having some sort of
                    harvest festival on the shore. We would be picked up by a Malay canoe and
                    brought through the surf to the shore where we would join the festivities. We
                    approached the shore. It was dark, the middle of the night. We could see the
                    bonfire burning brightly and people dancing around it. The first canoe came up
                    and the Resident told me and a few others to get on board. We were brought in
                    through the surf which was quite a hair raising experience. Then apparently the
                    surf picked up so it was decided that it was too rough to unload the other
                    passengers from the yacht. They would have to wait until the surf subsided.</p>
                <p>Then as I was standing on the beach, I heard somebody say, “Oh, one of the row
                    boats has come in from the yacht and it has capsized.” I didn't pay much
                    attention to that and then someone said, “Oh, it is the Resident and he has some
                    lady with him and they both capsized in the water.” I got a little nervous at
                    this because I had been a lifeguard in my past and I know how difficult it is to
                    bring an ordinary rowboat or dinghy through high surf. So I rushed to where this
                    happened and there appeared before me Anne, looking like a drowned rabbit, and
                    the Resident, equally moist, and a couple of his crewmen. Apparently they had
                    decided before the warning came in that they would come to the shore by dinghy.
                    They got caught by the waves and were lucky they didn't get hurt. I was quite
                    angry. But I noticed the Resident did not have his necktie on. I said, “Well, I
                    see that you have finally relented, you don't have your necktie.” He said, “Oh
                    yes I do. Here it is,” and he pulled it dripping out of his pocket and put it
                    on.</p>
                <p>Trengganu was a delightful spot. It really was the Malaya of Somerset Maugham and
                    myth. It was always pleasant. And I might add in general that it was always
                    pleasant to travel and see other towns and villages. While I had little
                    opportunity to do that in the early days because of the security situation, I
                    had many opportunities our second year because security had become much, much
                    better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Templar was able to accomplish something with his
                        safety villages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. These villages were extremely successful. That is why, I'm sure,
                    they were adopted years later for the Vietnam scene. The British became very
                    much more efficient. Templar was a superb leader. In fact, he is one of the
                    finest leaders I have been associated with. Head and shoulders above most of the
                    people in similar positions that I have run into. He had a very good chief of
                    police, Arthur Young, who had been the chief of police in the Borough of London,
                    the original old city of London. He was a big 6'6” fellow. He taught the Malay
                    policemen to help Chinese women across the street, go unarmed and treat people
                    civilly. He tried to make London bobbies out of them, and succeeded to a certain
                    extent. Their relations with the populace, which had been very dicey before that
                    time, especially since the policemen were mainly Malays and the population was
                    at least half Chinese, became extremely good. Also the British trained a lot of
                    home guard people in the new villages to carry arms and build up their own
                    little security forces. They eventually became quite successful. They weren't
                    too successful in the beginning, of course, because the people were still scared
                    of the guerrillas who would approach a settlement in force and terrorize
                    people.</p>
                <p>I haven't said much about the rubber plantations, but they were very interesting
                    too. They were highly organized, very efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who owned them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Mainly British, but there was one large Belgian plantation. I don't
                    think we Americans had any rubber plantations out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Firestone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I don't remember any. I don't think so. Tin, yes, and iron. Well, the
                    iron mountain near Kuantan was owned by an Australian, but had an American
                    engineer who was chief of the operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the Malays were Muslim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, the Malays were all Muslim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: The Chinese were a mixture of Buddhists, Christians, and Taoists. They
                    were not a particularly religious group. The Chinese had their own schools,
                    their own communities. They were quite exclusive.</p>
                <p>The Indians were a force to be contended with. There were a number of Indians and
                    Ceylonese in the government.</p>
                <p>But the Chinese were very exclusive and wanted to be taught in their own
                    language. They felt their education was quite as good or even better than the
                    British on the one hand and the Malay on the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Malay language is related to Thai is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, it is related to Indonesian. I was supposed to learn Malay and I
                    tried, but all my contacts were with English-speaking people so I really had
                    very little opportunity, except when I was traveling, to speak Malay. The
                    traveling that I did was usually in the second half of my stay there and I just
                    never did get any degree of fluency in or even working knowledge of Malay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chinese probably spoke Chinese, Malay and
                        English.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How widely was English spoken by the Malay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, I would say in the country, not widely at all, but among the people
                    that I met, the officials, all spoke fine English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was English taught in the schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, in many of the schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it compulsory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: As far as I can remember, yes. A large percentage of Malays went to
                    school. The new villages opened up all sorts of possibilities for education that
                    hadn't existed before.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that they were scattered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, along the rivers and forests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those scattered areas was there any kind of farming or
                        did they live on fish, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I would say there was a lot of fishing. I don't really recall much in
                    the way of farming. They must have grown some crops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They ate rice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, they ate rice. My orientation was almost 100 percent political and
                    military. While I had to sign everything that Dick Peters and Bob Myers did, of
                    course, I can't say that I knew all that much about the economics of the
                    country. They had poultry, fresh vegetables, coconuts, fruits, the usual
                    tropical food products.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some place rice was probably grown or imported.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, I think it was imported largely. I don't think...well maybe they did
                    produce rice. I am afraid my memory doesn't help much on that.</p>
                <p>Just to conclude, my time in the Federation was thoroughly enjoyable. The people
                    were extremely pleasant...Malays, Chinese, British, Indians. It was one of the
                    nicer posts. The story has a happy ending because Malaya did reach its
                    independence and did become a viable entity. It had its problems when it united
                    with Singapore, but then it separated because Tunku Abdul Rahman did not want to
                    have a majority of Chinese in the new Malaysia. Singapore with its overwhelming
                    number of Chinese put the numbers of Chinese over the Malays and they didn't
                    like each other. Lee Kuan Yew, a bright, aggressive, highly educated Chinese and
                    easy going Tunku Abdul Rahman were not exactly soul mates and didn't get along.
                    But they parted in a friendly way and the two countries still work closely
                    together to this day.</p>
                <p>But in contrast to some of the African countries where I have served since, which
                    have gone through all sorts of troubled times since they have become
                    independent, I think free Malaya has done relatively well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly better than Burma for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. From what little I know about Burma, the psychological atmosphere
                    in Malaya is much more benign. In Burma, from what little I could learn when I
                    visited Rangoon in 1947, everybody was scared to death of the Burmese, of the
                    security situation. I really can't say anything about it but I gathered that it
                    was an entirely different atmosphere. Heavens, shortly before I arrived in
                    Rangoon virtually the entire cabinet had been rubbed out, machine gunned to
                    death. Malaya was much more benign, ...with the exception of the guerrilla
                    insurgency which was tough and rough...but today I think it is one of the pearls
                    of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left in 1953 with some regret.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Left with great regret, yes, but with happy memories. And I have never
                    been back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the continuation of the interview with Hendrik Van
                        Oss. Today is June 13, 1991. The first topic today is Mr. Van Oss' period of
                        posting in Uganda. He was Consul General and Principal Officer in Kampala
                        from June 1960 to September 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did you happen to get an assignment to Uganda after all the service you had
                    in the Far East?</p>
                <p>VAN OSS: After the Far East we went to Vienna for three years and after Vienna I
                    went into the Department's Civil Aviation Division. Promotions were coming
                    slowly in those days and I was still a class-4 officer so I qualified for
                    language training or special training of other sorts. I thought I might as well
                    make a benefit out of adversity so I volunteered for African area
                    specialization. I was accepted in 1959 and sent to SAIA at Johns Hopkins in
                    Washington and had a year of special African area studies.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Bamako, Mali, a new post that I was supposed to open. Nobody
                    knew anything about Mali. The Department had absolutely nothing on it and we
                    were resigned to our fate, but then, fortunately, I was promoted, became a
                    class-3 officer and as a result the Department changed my assignment to Kampala,
                    which was already a firmly established post.</p>
                <p>Uganda is really a very sad story. It is a story of what might have been. What it
                    was when I was there was not what it eventually became. When I was there it was
                    a very promising country in the last stages before independence. The British
                    were doing a very good job in preparing the Ugandans for independence. There was
                    no acrimony to speak of between the African population and the British...I was
                    going to say colonial masters, but they weren't. Great Britain had, as you know
                    if you read your history, a special relationship with Uganda. It had treaties
                    with the four main kingdoms and had a special relationship with them. They were
                    protectorates, not really full fledged colonies.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Uganda was a country with considerable promise. It had very fine agricultural
                    possibilities. It had possibly the thickest top soil in the world, I think at
                    least 12 feet of top soil. Everything was very, very fertile. If you stuck
                    wooden poles in the ground to shore up your rose bushes, the poles themselves
                    would sprout. Ugandans would stick palm fronds into the ground lining the
                    streets when their Kabaka or king passed; many of the fronds would take root. So
                    the agricultural potential was considerable. Uganda grew lots of coffee, cotton
                    and had all the other tropical commodities...sugar, palm oil, etc.</p>
                <p>Also it had a very healthy climate. Most of the country was over 3,000 feet high.
                    Our house was about 4,500 feet above sea level. The climate could get hot during
                    the day, but at night it usually cooled off and was so chilly that one couldn't
                    give cocktail parties outside without wearing sweaters.</p>
                <p>The people of Uganda were relatively well educated. There was probably a higher
                    number of college graduates in Uganda than any other African country, with the
                    possible exception of Nigeria and Ghana. There was a university, Makerere
                    University, which had been established in the twenties and which was a small
                    edition of Oxford. It had different colleges, or houses, students ate in gowns,
                    etc. So, it was based on the British educational system, which, of course, is a
                    very good one.</p>
                <p>It had a very strong traditional structure. When discovered about a hundred years
                    before, and when the British first came in 1860, Uganda was not an entity. It
                    consisted of different states or tribes. In the main there were four
                    kingdoms...the kingdoms of Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro and Ankole. Each kingdom had a
                    hereditary king.</p>
                <p>In the case of Buganda, which was the largest, richest, and most advanced
                    kingdom, the king or Kabaka could trace his ancestry back at least 600 years.
                    The kingdoms had court customs, their own government structures...especially
                    Buganda, which had its own government even at the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>The British were preparing them very carefully for independence. They had
                    established a legislative council which later became known as the National
                    Assembly. They had held an election and had elected members, with a few
                    appointed members as well and they were easing in to the full self government
                    stage when we first got there. The Ugandans would argue and debate legislation
                    in their legislative council. The proceedings were based on the way things are
                    done in Parliament in London. Members bowed to the Speaker on taking their
                    seats. In the intervals members would go upstairs for tea and members of rival
                    parties would joke with each other. It was a very pleasant atmosphere. Everybody
                    seemed to be friendly and anxious to start the process of self government.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Historically there were no white settlers in Uganda so no white settler problems
                    to worry about. There were about 10,000 whites in the country, but none was
                    allowed to own land. In other words, land could not be alienated to
                    non-Africans. So there was no question of white settlers wanting their own
                    government, or unilateral independence as in Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>All the elements seemed in place for Uganda to develop into a successful,
                    independent entity. But things went wrong a few years after I left. So I can't
                    really tell you anything about that except what has already appeared in many
                    papers. I just have to remind you that Milton Obote, the prime minister, ejected
                    the Kabaka, who was president of the first independent government, and drove him
                    into exile. He had to flee for his life. Then Idi Amin, commanding general of
                    the Ugandan army, deposed Obote and perpetrated the horrors we have read about.
                    Then, with the help of Tanzania, Amin was driven out, and after several interim
                    presidents, Vincent Lule and Godfrey Binaisa, Obote returned to power,
                    committing his share of atrocities. Finally, after more civil strife, Obote was
                    again deposed, and Museveni took over as prime minister or president. Perhaps
                    the greatest horror of all now is one of the most severe AIDS epidemics in all
                    of Africa.</p>
                <p>So, here was a hopeful, promising country in every sense of the word and just
                    everything went wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any hint of what might occur while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, there were many hints that you could look back on and put your
                    finger on in hindsight, yes. So-called tribalism was always strong. Uganda was
                    divided into about 11 districts or provinces. Each district had a predominate
                    tribe...if I use tribe it is not in a demeaning sense, it is just an easier
                    expression because tribalism is the curse of Africa and was certainly in
                    evidence in those days. In the sixties, for example, the Baganda in Buganda,
                    which is the largest entity of Uganda, the one that is ruled by the Kabaka, were
                    the best educated, richest, farthest advanced in almost every respect, and as
                    such were the objects of envy and hatred by virtually all other tribal units. In
                    fact there had been a long tradition of warfare in the past between Buganda and
                    Bunyoro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Buganda want a separate status?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, Buganda had a special treaty with the British which set them up in
                    a special category. They had their own government, their own parliament, their
                    own prime minister. It was a government that functioned under the Ugandan
                    government in theory but in actuality it functioned pretty much independently.
                    In fact, in December 1960, the Baganda declared unilateral independence.
                    Everybody simply ignored this. The British continued to collect taxes, and to
                    give the annual monetary support that they always had given to the Baganda.
                    There was a lot of drumming on the night of independence and that was about the
                    only celebration. Oh, the Buganda ministers would pay lip service to their
                    independence and say that they don't pay any attention to the Uganda government.
                    In fact there was no change in status. But Buganda always felt itself to have a
                    special relationship with the British and be deserving of special consideration
                    by the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Buganda the largest territory and was it part of the
                        area that included Kampala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. Buganda is the central portion north of Lake Victoria. It is an
                    inner core that covers about a third of the area of Uganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they about a third of the population as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: As I recall, roughly a third out of a total of about 7 or 8 million
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So most of the people in Kampala would be Baganda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I suppose you are right, but there was a large contingent of bureaucrats
                    who were not Baganda.</p>
                <p>My point in all this...we were trying to think of hints of trouble to come...the
                    Baganda didn't get along well with other tribal areas. There was a saying that
                    although the Baganda were the richest and the cleverest, Uganda would never be
                    governed by a Muganda, it would always be a northerner who governs Uganda. And
                    indeed this may well prove to be true, Obote was a Langi from Lira and Idi Amin
                    was a Kakwa from West Nile, so they certainly were northerners. The Baganda have
                    not really had control over the entire country since Uganda's independence.</p>
                <p>So had we paid more attention and taken tribalism a little more seriously at the
                    time we were there, we might have foreseen what was going to happen. But this
                    was all submerged pretty much in the preparations for independence. People
                    seemed to be working together regardless of tribe in the legislative council.
                    The underlying animosities simply were not very much in evidence.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Now there was a great deal of animosity in the beginning between Obote, when he
                    was president of the Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC), and the Kabaka. They had
                    gotten together a few months before the final election, immediately prior to the
                    independence ceremonies when the Ugandans would take over the government. The
                    Kabaka's group called Kabaka Yekka formed an alliance with the Uganda Peoples
                    Congress and defeated the Democratic Party, which became the opposition party.
                    So Obote and the Kabaka were in cahoots for a while and were working together.
                    The agreement was that the Kabaka would become the president, or the ceremonial
                    head of the country, and Obote would be the prime minister, or the executive
                    head. That took place and stayed in position for a year or so. But the
                    personalities of Obote and the Kabaka were such that the partnership could never
                    last, although this was not apparent at the time. If we had analyzed this
                    arrangement more carefully, we probably should have foreseen even while I was
                    still there that this marriage of convenience could never last.</p>
                <p>So, yes, the elements were in place for the destruction of Uganda, but they
                    seemed to be in eclipse and all the signs were positive as of the time I
                    left.</p>
                <p>On the positive side again, before we get away from this...other positive
                    elements were the fact that there seemed to be complete racial harmony in the
                    country. By that I mean there were a number of interracial marriages among quite
                    well-known people. The English Director of the Kampala museum was married to a
                    Kiganda woman. The head of the Aga Khan school, Brendan McCourt, was married to
                    a Chagga from Tanganyika. There was a great deal of social intercourse between
                    whites and blacks.</p>
                <p>Also on the positive side there was a very strong women's movement. There were
                    some very powerful women there. Pouma Kissosonkole who started life as a Xhosa
                    in South Africa was married to Chris Kissosonkole, a prominent Buganda notable.
                    She was really an important official in the international women's movement.
                    Rebecca Mulire was another very impressive woman. Sara Entiko was a member of
                    the legislative council and married to a Tanganyikan artist. There were a number
                    of other well-educated, strong women. In other words, they were not all by any
                    means sitting in the entrances to huts and grinding meal.</p>
                <p>One of the fascinating things about Buganda, I thought, was the Kabaka's court.
                    The Kabaka at this time was Freddy Mutesa II who was a young man in his late
                    thirties or early forties. He had been exiled briefly in the early 1950s. That
                    was a traumatic experience for the Baganda and he was eventually brought back in
                    triumph. Among his people he was very well regarded and even revered. He was the
                    spirit and the soul of Buganda. When he was in a room no Muganda could be in a
                    higher place than the Kabaka. In other words, if he was seated, his subjects
                    coming into the same room had to crawl in on their knees. This was always an
                    astonishing thing for visitors from the States to see; even the Kiganda Minister
                    of Finance had to come in on his knees.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The Kabaka, himself, was a quiet, soft-spoken young man. He was also very arcane
                    and very devious. He rarely came out and said exactly what he meant on anything.
                    If you asked him a question he would mumble, “Weeeeeell, yes,” or “Hmmmmm,
                    perhaps.” He would speak in such a way that you could draw all kinds of
                    inferences, but couldn't pin down exactly what his views were.</p>
                <p>One thing that he was very clear on, however, was his opposition to the East
                    African Federation. The East African Federation (EAF) was a brain child of the
                    British who thought that East Africa would be a better economic and political
                    unit with Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda joined together as three partners. While
                    some of the Ugandans were not all that opposed to EAF, the Baganda were. The
                    Kabaka was definitely opposed to it. The reason, I think behind his opposition,
                    was that he felt Kenya was dominated by white settlers and that if Uganda
                    entered into an East African Federation with Kenya, eventually the whites would
                    extend their control over the whole area. He didn't want that. So in his own way
                    he was an ardent African nationalist. But he also was an elitist. He was
                    convinced of the superiority of his tribe, of his nation, and he did not
                    contemplate lightly any situation developing in Uganda in which Buganda took a
                    secondary role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Nyerere in favor of this Federation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, Nyerere was a very foresighted, intelligent man. He was educated at
                    Makerere University and I think he, in principle, thought the East African
                    Federation was the way to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wondered if Nyerere's positive attitude influenced
                        the Kabaka's negative attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, I don't think so. I think the Kabaka came to this on his own. He was
                    also very clever. He was a graduate of Sandhurst and spoke perfect English. If
                    you threw a blanket over his head and heard him talk you wouldn't know he was an
                    African, which is most unusual. Almost 99 percent of the Africans have a
                    distinctive accent of one sort or another when they speak English.</p>
                <p>To go to the Kabaka's palace to see him was quite an experience. His palace was a
                    series of very large wooden and thatched-roofed structures. Very elegant, but
                    still basic. There was always drumming going on and music of some sort. The
                    drumming changed whenever the Kabaka would move from one building to another so
                    that somebody in the know could tell exactly where the Kabaka was at all
                    times.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The Kabaka, himself, spoke in a very low voice. My hearing is not the most acute
                    in the world so I was constantly straining to hear what he had to say and the
                    fact that he never spoke very directly on any subject made it extremely
                    difficult to know what he really did say. I suspect that this was done
                    purposely, to give himself the utmost flexibility on every conceivable
                    subject.</p>
                <p>There were a number of courtyards and gardens in the palace complex. Whenever he
                    had a reception at night there would be fountains bubbling and a band playing in
                    the background. These receptions would take place in different parts of the
                    palace grounds on different occasions. If you shut your eyes and just listened
                    to the ambiance and the sound you might have thought you were in the Buckingham
                    Palace grounds. That might be a little farfetched, but it wasn't all that
                    different. His ministers were all dressed in dark suits and neckties as was he.
                    These were very dignified, rather pleasant occasions; more European in character
                    than African.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Kampala in 1960, what were the
                        conditions that you found? What was our Consulate like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: There was really nothing unusual about the Consulate. It had just been
                    elevated into a Consulate General so I gloried in that promotion. The housing
                    was quite decent. We first lived on Kololo Hill. We moved very shortly to
                    another place on Makindi Hill, which is right outside of town and one of the
                    nicest places I have ever been in. It was a bungalow, a typical, old, British
                    style bungalow located on top of a hill. We had nine acres of garden and forest
                    around the bungalow. It was the hill that the Kabaka was born on. Our bungalow
                    had a beautiful view of the city of Kampala, Lake Victoria, and surrounding flat
                    top hills. It had a beautiful climate, cool and invigorating. Really one of the
                    most pleasant places I have ever been in in my life.</p>
                <p>That is not to say that we didn't have some rather strange experiences. One of
                    them being that our bungalow was in the path of an army ant march. We saw it
                    coming because snakes, insects, and rodents came out of the bushes in flight so
                    we knew something was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean they were getting out of the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. Then the ants came. They don't come in a broad path, they come in a
                    narrow line about two inches wide and there are thousands and thousands and
                    thousands of them. In fact, after they have passed, the grass is worn away in
                    the two inch wide path. In this case, they came right at the house. We had
                    surrounded the house with ant repellent and this probably deflected them from
                    going inside. But they were underneath the foundations, in all the crevasses,
                    all over the place. And you could easily see how a baby, for example, could be
                    just consumed by these ants...they get into the lungs, nose, eyes, crawl all
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is why the animals were fleeing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh yes, any living thing in the path of one of these army ant migrations
                    is in for bad trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there is no stopping them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: No stopping them. You can deflect them by means of chemicals, I suppose,
                    but it is hard. We were lucky. The one good thing about it is that they go in
                    this rather narrow line so they don't disperse all over the place, unless you
                    step on that path. Then you disperse them and they crawl all over you.</p>
                <p>Also once a black mamba snake slithered into the house. I was at the office and
                    the gardeners killed it. My wife was quite excited at that.</p>
                <p>We saw monkeys up on Makindi. There were wonderful trails to walk on. There were
                    probably leopards too, but I never saw one.</p>
                <p>In any event, our accommodations were basically fine, nothing to complain about.
                    They were not modern and were not luxurious, but they were just comfortable and
                    pleasant. In fact everything about the post was pleasant.</p>
                <p>We had about, in our heyday, five officers in the Consulate General, five in AID
                    and several in USIS. Then we had about two dozen local employees, Ugandan
                    nationals of one sort or another. So all together there were about three dozen
                    of us at our peak. When we turned into an Embassy after independence, that
                    number expanded by quite a good deal. When I first got there it was considerably
                    smaller than that.</p>
                <p>Our relations with the State Department were splendid, I think. The Department
                    could not have been more helpful in every respect until the very end when they
                    reassigned me somewhere; I didn't like that very much. But apart from that I
                    can't complain about my treatment.</p>
                <p>The head of the African Bureau, the Assistant Secretary, was Joe Satterthwaite.
                    After Kennedy was elected, Governor Mennen Williams of Michigan was appointed.
                    Mennen Williams was almost worth a tape by himself, but I won't go into that
                    because I am sure many people have known him. As you know he was a presidential
                    candidate. The good thing about Soapy Williams was that he was a fighter, he was
                    interested in Africa and he did more to put Africa on the map than any other
                    American. He had his weaknesses. He was egotistical, a typical politician in
                    many ways. But he was also as strong as a horse and had the best will in the
                    world. He was a good man to work under in most ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The Desk officers that I had were all good, sympathetic and cooperative. So I
                    can't complain about relations with the Department. When we had personnel
                    difficulties they supported us. When we needed people, they assigned them. And
                    it is interesting to note that my number two...when I went out there it was a
                    fellow by the name of Hap Funk, who was later killed in an automobile accident
                    in Kenya, but he was a splendid officer, one of the best I have ever had. His
                    place was taken by a gentleman named Hank Cohen, who now is Assistant Secretary
                    for African Affairs in the Department. He was equally fine and certainly slated
                    for stardom. I can't really say that I had anything to do with his later
                    eminence. But there is one thing I did do for him; I taught him how to use a
                    stick shift on a land rover, something he hadn't learned up to that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your national employees? Were they from
                        different tribes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: They were from every conceivable tribe. I would say the dominant group
                    was from the Baganda. But we had Aggrey Willis a Luo related to Oginga Odinga,
                    one of the main African leaders in Kenya. We had some Indian employees. My
                    driver Athmani, as I recall was a Muslim from Toro. Our own household
                    staff...our laundry amah was from Toro. The head “boy” or head servant, was a
                    Muganda, etc. We made a point of not having them all from one ethnic group. We
                    also made it a point of not separating them. They each had their own place to
                    live next to our bungalow, not very elegant quarters, but clean with modern
                    bathroom facilities. While they probably would have preferred to be farther
                    apart from each other because of their tribal differences, I didn't pay too much
                    attention, feeling that by example we should down-play ethnic differences.</p>
                <p>I might say also that all of us in the African Bureau in those days...the African
                    Bureau really didn't come into existence until about 1959. There had been people
                    working on Africa like Joe Palmer, Bill Witman, etc. But these were assigned to
                    the Near East Bureau. Some of the African countries were handled by the desk
                    officers of their colonial masters. It was only around 1959 that Satterthwaite
                    became the first Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. I think I was part of
                    the first group of African specialists after the original few like Joe Palmer
                    and Bill Witman who specialized in Africa affairs years before anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike Hoyt came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, I remember him.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>So, our relations with the Ugandan employees, I thought, were very good. They
                    came to our parties. They were treated like everybody else. Unfortunately their
                    salaries were not very high, but that was true of Foreign Service locally hired
                    personnel all over the world in those days. The Department tried to economize by
                    paying local wages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember doing the local wage surveys we had to do
                        every couple of years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, we made a point of not out-bidding the average organization in the
                    country where we were stationed, because that could lead to hard feelings and
                    enhance our negative image as rich Americans.</p>
                <p>While we are talking about relations with the people, we had a very successful
                    cultural exchange program in Uganda. The U.S. government sponsored some really
                    top grade entertainment that we brought to Uganda. For example, we had Holiday
                    On Ice, which came in with a huge lift van filled with special ice making
                    equipment. You must understand that most Africans had never seen ice or at least
                    most in Kampala had never seen ice. There may be ice on the top of the Mountains
                    of the Moon in the western part of Uganda, but there certainly is none in
                    Kampala. So we had an arena, a basketball court I think it was, filled with ice
                    and lots of Ugandan spectators sitting in the bleachers. As the first two
                    members of the chorus came out and glided onto the ice one heard an “Ohhhhhh” of
                    wonderment from the audience. I think the audience appreciated those first two
                    slides more than they did all the other intricate skating and acrobatics that
                    went on afterwards. That first impression of gliding on ice was like magic to
                    them.</p>
                <p>We also had the Golden Gate Quartet. This was interesting because many Ugandans
                    came up to me afterwards and asked, “Are those American blacks?” I said, “Yes.”
                    And they said, “Are you sure they are not American whites who are made up to
                    look like blacks?” I said, “No, they are genuine American blacks.” At the party
                    we gave for them Ugandans would come up to one of the singers and would say
                    something to the effect, “You are our brother.” And the singer would say, “No, I
                    am not. I am an American.” This was before American blacks thought much about
                    returning to their roots. They were proud to be Americans and we were proud of
                    them.</p>
                <p>We had Louis Armstrong. He came with his combo and gave several concerts. He was
                    sponsored by the U.S. government. We probably made a mistake, but we accepted
                    Pepsi Cola's offer to stage the event because the Consulate General didn't have
                    any money for such purposes. Pepsi Cola hired the football stadium and put out
                    all sorts of advertisement. We told Pepsi Cola that we would not tolerate any
                    active commercialization at the concert, but they were welcome to have it
                    generally known that they were sponsoring it. Of course Louis Armstrong was not
                    thoroughly briefed on that point and after he said his guttural good night to
                    everybody as he did after all his concerts at home, he said, “Good night all,
                    good night all, drink your Pepsi Cola.” I had to ask him afterwards not to say
                    that again and he agreed not to.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>We took Armstrong and his wife to see the Kabaka. He had a singer with him, a
                    very corpulent female whose name I have forgotten. She did a lot of gymnastics
                    while singing and at that altitude it was apparently too much of a strain,
                    because in Kenya later during the middle of her performance she keeled over and
                    died. Well, in any event she was still alive in Uganda and she and Louis and his
                    wife, and I think one other went with me to call on the Kabaka. They were very
                    anxious to meet “King Freddy,” as they called him.</p>
                <p>King Freddy received them in his palace. Various Buganda officials who were great
                    Louis Armstrong fans came into the royal chamber on their knees, and Louis' eyes
                    just popped out of his head when he saw that. At one point the Kabaka, who was
                    amused by all this, trying to make conversation said, “Well, Mr. Armstrong, to
                    what do you attribute your perpetual youthfulness and enthusiasm” Louis
                    Armstrong replied, “Oh, King Freddy, I attribute it to Ex-Lax. Every night after
                    dinner I take Ex-Lax and my wife does too.” The Kabaka gave an embarrassed
                    smile—he didn't quite know how to handle that one. Anyway, Louis' visit was an
                    overwhelming success.</p>
                <p>We also had an interesting boxing program. One of the American AID employees, an
                    American named Mitch Biedul, was a former boxer and boxing coach. If there is
                    any sport that the Ugandans like besides soccer and wrestling, it is boxing.
                    They had several amateurs who went quite far in one of the Olympics. Mitch
                    Biedul became their coach. While we were there we invited some American Golden
                    Glove boxers out to box the Ugandans. We had a great evening of boxing. The
                    Americans won two matches, one was tied and they lost a match...a steal I might
                    add, as the officials were heavily prejudiced in Uganda's favor. But never mind,
                    it made for a friendly evening.</p>
                <p>What else did we have? We had a conference on African-American poetry. Langston
                    Hughes showed up for that. I had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with him.
                    There were a number of other well-known African poets and black American
                    academicians and writers. It was a very interesting event.</p>
                <p>That was really a golden period for our relations with Africa...this early period
                    right before and during the final moments before independence. It was a time of
                    hope for Africans and Americans alike. We in the African Bureau had high hopes
                    that the Africans in some way could find a short cut to stability, could learn
                    from the experiences of the West and in effect could achieve instant democracy
                    instead of having to go through a long period of apprenticeship, trial and error
                    and several hundred years of history to accomplish it. And, of course, we were
                    wrong, but we had high hopes in those days. A lot of that was due to Soapy
                    Williams' enthusiasm, combativeness and success in convincing the U.S.
                    government to provide aid and money. I don't think we have been that successful
                    since in helping Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>One of the most important things we did during this great period of enthusiasm
                    was to put into being a very large program of providing teachers for East
                    Africa. I think we sent something like 250 young Americans, all college
                    graduates, some of them with teaching certificates, most of them without. The
                    understanding was that those without teaching certificates would take a full
                    school term of special instruction in British teaching techniques at Makerere
                    University. In my own opinion I didn't think they needed that; I thought they
                    were perfectly able to go out at once and teach. But the British are a little
                    bit stuffy about their education system and tended to look down on our American
                    system. They didn't accept our teaching standards or teaching certificates, so
                    they insisted on this training period. We agreed because we felt it was worth it
                    to get these young Americans in.</p>
                <p>So for the better part of a semester, maybe it was two semesters, we had dozens
                    and dozens of Americans at Makerere University studying alongside the African
                    students. They really put a new dimension into Makerere. They did all sorts of
                    things...put on plays, organized extra curricular events, more than carried
                    their weight. Eventually they dispersed to schools throughout East Africa. About
                    a third stayed in Uganda and the rest went to Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
                <p>That was a highly successful program. Eventually it was taken over by the Peace
                    Corps. While it was going on a special supervisor, I think his name was Fielding
                    or Fields, came out from Columbia University Teachers College, the sponsoring
                    organization at home. The U.S. government supplied the money, but Columbia
                    Teachers College picked the students and supervised them in the early stages. It
                    was a great experience for everybody...for me, the students, the Ugandans...I
                    think it was very helpful to all. I don't know what eventually happened to the
                    program, whether the Peace Corps sustained it. I suspect that the whole thing
                    fell apart during the Idi Amin catastrophe.</p>
                <p>One of the delights of being in Uganda at this period was that we could do a lot
                    of traveling. Uganda is a beautiful country. Each district has its own
                    characteristics which, I think, account for the differences between the tribal
                    units. You have the Mountains of the Moon in the west, savannah like country in
                    the south, and the hilly country in the Kigesi area, etc.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of traveling and was always happy to be on the road. Accommodations
                    were usually reasonably acceptable and the people were always extremely
                    friendly. There were many interesting things to see. For example, in a place
                    called Soroti, up in the northern area, there was a school for the blind which
                    was run by a Nun, Sister Viani. I used to visit the school every time I was in
                    the area because I found it so appealing and impressive. These youngsters, who
                    were mostly born blind, had they not been taken in by the school might have
                    perished because Ugandans in the villages don't know what to do with imperfect
                    human beings. If somebody has had polio, for example, they crawl around and are
                    fed, but a blind youngster is left to his own resources often getting into life
                    threatening difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>The school for the blind must have had five or six dozen blind youngsters of all
                    ages. They were taught all sorts of things...how to play musical instruments,
                    dance. It was really an emotional experience to see these little kids playing on
                    drums, tubas, violins and dancing around. Granted these were British country
                    dances, not African dances, but it was an interesting thing to have in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>There were also a number of monasteries run by monks...a number of American monks
                    as a matter of fact. They were always great fun, were delighted to see somebody
                    from the States and to have a new face appear in their midst.</p>
                <p>Out in Toro Father McCauley, an American, was ordained a Bishop while I was
                    there. They had a special ceremony for him. He was very well-known and a very
                    fine man.</p>
                <p>The northeastern portion of the country is a very wild area called Karamoja. The
                    Karamojong, I guess, were the most primitive people in Uganda, if not in Africa.
                    The men run around without any clothes except for a dark blanket or cloak. They
                    have very elaborate headdresses, caking their hair with mud and cow dung and
                    then letting the whole mess harden and painting it in elaborate colors. They
                    sleep with a special stand under their necks so that the hair will not be mussed
                    while they're asleep. They keep the headdresses intact for as long as they last,
                    which is quite a considerable length of time. They are very interesting people,
                    cattle raisers.</p>
                <p>The real old Ugandan hands, the British who had been in Uganda all their lives
                    and loved it, liked that part of Uganda the best because it is the least
                    changed. It is closest to what has always existed there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nomadic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Nomadic, although a lot of them have settled around Moroto and have
                    started to engage in agricultural pursuits. The Catholic missionaries have tried
                    to teach them that. The main problem is that the young Karamojong and the
                    Turkana in neighboring Kenya have standing feuds. The Turkana come and raid the
                    cattle of the Karamojong and then the Karamojong young men go out and blood
                    their spears by taking cattle back from the Turkana and killing a few Turkanas
                    here and there in the process.</p>
                <p>That, in fact, is where Idi Amin apparently got his first fame. After Ugandan
                    independence the Uganda government wanted to put a stop to all this nonsense of
                    raids and counter raids between the Karamajong and the Turkana. So after the
                    Turkana committed one of their annual raids the Ugandan government sent up a
                    detachment of soldiers under the command of then-buck sergeant Amin. He took the
                    detachment into Turkana and absolutely razed a Turkana village. There was quite
                    a bit of flak over that. It was the first time he had come to anybody's
                    attention. This was after I had left so I have the story second hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I did travel to Karamoja so I saw it. In fact, I went to all corners of the
                    country and was interested in all of them. There was another interesting group
                    in the eastern part of Uganda on the flanks of Mount Elgon, the Sebei. At one
                    point, these people declared their “independence” and were allowed to become a
                    separate district. However, the Sebei treated this as being independent. They
                    held an independence ceremony and I went up there. There was an American
                    anthropologist who was spending his time doing research in Sebei country. That
                    was highly interesting.</p>
                <p>So I have done my share of African dancing along with all the others at various
                    ceremonies.</p>
                <p>There was one fascinating place on the Kagera River, which flows into Lake
                    Victoria near the border with Tanzania and has as good a claim as any to being
                    the ultimate source of the Nile, that we were very fond of visiting. It was run
                    by an Italian lady named Toni Nuti, who was a hunter and a well- known character
                    in the area. She and her husband had planned to build a hotel on an island in
                    the middle of the Kagera River. He had died before the hotel was finished. In
                    order to stay alive she took in paying guests in her own house. She had four
                    guest bedrooms with baths.</p>
                <p>I used to go down there whenever I was in the area and would often take the
                    family down. Toni was a lover of animals and had her own pet antelopes, civet
                    cat in a cage in her window, a sort of pet hippopotamus, although she couldn't
                    get anywhere near him, who made his home on the island and whom she called Lord
                    Nelson. You could get up to about fifty yards of Lord Nelson and then it would
                    begin to show signs of hostility and if you were wise you would beat a hasty
                    retreat. Toni Nuti was a great character, a fine woman, but of the old school.
                    Definitely a colonial type, but still great fun and somebody well worth
                    knowing.</p>
                <p>Speaking of that part of Uganda, if you go over a little bit you get to the
                    southernmost tip of Uganda or Kigesi which borders on Rwanda. Shortly before,
                    while we were still in Uganda, neighboring Rwanda erupted into civil war and the
                    lower class Hutu laid waste to the aristocratic Watusi. A lot of Watusi fled
                    across the border into Uganda and camped in the southern part of Kigesi. These
                    refugees were in bad shape. They were the typical Watusi, tall, slender, good
                    looking people. We (the U.S. government) sent a lot of flour down there to feed
                    the refugees. I took some of it down myself and presented it to the refugees
                    making a little public relations act, taking pictures, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>One interesting thing was that the flour was made from sorghum and was yellow in
                    color. The refugees didn't want to eat it because the flour they were accustomed
                    to was white. One of our AID officers from Kenya who was helping in the
                    presentation took it upon himself to explain that the sorghum was a perfectly
                    good flour, so good that we fed it to our cattle in the U.S. I don't remember
                    how I got over that one, but some way or other I persuaded them that while it
                    may be true that cattle ate sorghum, it was also consumed by the best people in
                    the United States and was perfectly decent, acceptable, edible flour. They did
                    eventually eat it and were happy to have it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the political situation
                        in Uganda during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is a good question. I suppose you could divide the political
                    situation into two general parts. The first was the series of events that
                    concerned the relationship between Buganda and the rest of Uganda. The second
                    was what you might call the striving for independence and the movement toward
                    independence in Uganda as a whole, which was really more important and more
                    interesting to the outside world.</p>
                <p>As to the first, when I first arrived in Kampala I was paying my calls on various
                    Ugandan government officials and decided to pay calls on certain Bugandan
                    officials as well because I knew they were very proud and would feel slighted if
                    I didn't. So I made an arrangement to see Michael Kintu, who was then Katikero,
                    or prime minister of Buganda. I frankly admit that I was not thoroughly enough
                    briefed on this point or I would have handled it a little bit differently. What
                    happened was that when I went to see Kintu, he ushered me into a room where
                    there were a number of other gentlemen sitting. It turned out that he was right
                    in the middle of a Buganda cabinet meeting. He had summoned his cabinet to
                    receive the American representative. I had not been pre-warned and had no idea
                    that he was going to do this. It had not occurred to me that this would present
                    any problem whatsoever. So, I went in, nonetheless, shook hands and said “Hello”
                    to everybody. The first question was asked by Amos Sempa, the Buganda Finance
                    Minister, a small, sharp, very chauvinistic Bugandan. He asked, “Why has not the
                    United States government given assistance to the nation of Buganda?” I was taken
                    back by that. I said, “I think we have given assistance to Uganda,” not being
                    aware at that early moment of what exact point he was driving at. He said, “Yes,
                    but why not Buganda? We have our own government.” Fortunately, Abu Mayanja who
                    was a Bugandan I had met in Washington before I came out to Uganda, came to my
                    rescue. He was one of the more enlightened Bugandans. He said, “Well, Mr. Sempa,
                    this is not a proper question to ask the American Consul General. I am sure that
                    he does not want to hurt your feelings, but it is not necessarily appropriate
                    for the American government to be giving assistance to a Ugandan province.”
                    Sempa was a little miffed by that, of course, as he was trying to trip me up. At
                    that point I caught on to what was happening and found the right words to say
                    that we would of course look into the matter but generally speaking our
                    assistance is given to the national government in place. Apparently my
                    explanation appeased him, as he did not pursue the matter.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The only reason I mention this is to emphasize that one had to be careful all the
                    time, especially when dealing with ardent Bugandan nationalists. One had to show
                    awareness of their differences from other Ugandans, their place in the sun, of
                    their claim to existence as a separate entity. And, of course, in the early
                    days, soon after I arrived, Buganda was beginning to agitate more and more for
                    so-called independence. As I indicated before, Buganda actually did declare its
                    independence in December 1960, soon after we had arrived. The British were very
                    concerned about this development because it had nothing to do with the
                    preparations that they were already beginning to make to give Uganda as a whole
                    its independence. But Buganda claimed it had a special treaty relationship with
                    the British and under that treaty they wanted to be independent from the rest of
                    Uganda. They claimed a right to get their own independence. If the British
                    wouldn't give it to them, they would declare themselves independent anyway and
                    indeed they did. But afterwards the British simply paid no attention. The
                    government of Uganda at that time was in British hands and they simply smiled
                    and went on doing exactly what they had been doing, as if the Buganda
                    declaration of independence had never taken place.</p>
                <p>And, indeed, the Buganda, themselves, didn't make very much of it except for a
                    bit of drumming the day after independence was declared. But when the time came
                    for them to get their annual stipend from the British government they
                    conveniently forgot they were independent and accepted the cash with the
                    greatest of pleasure.</p>
                <p>While still on Buganda, I might explain that Buganda had its own parliament, its
                    own cabinet, its own governmental structure which was roughly comparable to the
                    state governmental structures in the United States. And it carried out local
                    government activities with the approval of their British protectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unlike any other tribal area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Some of the other tribal areas had similar structures but of a lower
                    order. What they had in effect were simply courts and social structures,
                    monarchies without any real power. The Omukama of Toro, for example, had his
                    palace, which was just a big house. You called him “Your Highness” when you went
                    to see him. Some of his servants came in on their knees but not to the extent
                    they did in Buganda. Banyoro was probably closest to Buganda in structural
                    terms. The Banyoro, of course, laid claim to part of Buganda, the so-called lost
                    provinces of Bunyoro, which were taken over by the Buganda in the course of
                    their age old struggles with Banyoro.</p>
                <p>So a distinction between Buganda and the rest of Uganda was always there and it
                    was a kind of side show to the main developments that were taking place
                    politically throughout the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Now, the main political scene. Before I went out to Uganda I heard people like
                    Abu Mayanja, George Kigezi and others, talking about their struggles for
                    independence. They did their best to struggle for independence, but, of course,
                    the British at that point had decided they were going to give Uganda its
                    independence so there wasn't much actual struggling going on when I got there.
                    There wasn't even much posturing. The battle had been won. They knew they were
                    going to get their independence so this was the administrative preparation
                    stage.</p>
                <p>What happened was that the British arranged for elections to be held. These
                    elections were for an interim government which would take control under British
                    tutelage. Some of the British institutions would remain in place. Then the
                    interim government would prepare for the real thing which the British had
                    decided would be on October 9, 1962. This was decided after various conferences
                    with Ugandans and British participating.</p>
                <p>Now this is where Buganda independence comes in. When the elections for the
                    interim government were being arranged, most of the Buganda boycotted the
                    elections. The only people in Buganda district who did not join the boycott and
                    who voted were members of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party,
                    predominantly Catholic, was headed by a lawyer named Benedicto Kiwanuka. I
                    believe he was the brother, certainly a relative, of Joseph “Jolly Joe”
                    Kiwanuka, who was one of the original nationalists in Uganda, one of those who
                    really did fight for independence, who was put in jail and for a while accepted
                    by the unknowing Western world as the leader of Uganda's independence movement.
                    In actuality he never did have much of a following and was not an important
                    factor during my time in Uganda.</p>
                <p>Benedicto Kiwanuka was a Catholic and I suppose I had better interject here that
                    one of the differences and areas of conflict within Uganda was the religious
                    one. There was a very strong Protestant element, a very strong Catholic element
                    and a very strong Muslim element. The Protestant element tended to be the main
                    religious grouping in Buganda district. The Muslims were in the south and north.
                    The Catholics were spread fairly evenly throughout the country, and there was a
                    significant number in Buganda, who did not really approve of the Buganda
                    independence movement and who supported the interim elections.</p>
                <p>The Democratic Party, therefore, won all the Buganda seats...or I think all but
                    one. That really gave Benedicto Kiwanuka's party the victory over Obote and the
                    United Peoples Congress, which by all rights should have won that election
                    because they got the majority of seats in the areas outside of Buganda. But the
                    Buganda seats gave the Democratic Party the election even though they were not
                    the majority party in terms of overall support.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>So Benedicto Kiwanuka took over as chief minister and as the first Ugandan head
                    of an all-Ugandan government. He really couldn't govern because he didn't have
                    enough support. He didn't have support within Buganda because his people who
                    supported him comprised only about 10 percent of all Buganda. Eventually Obote
                    and the Uganda Peoples Congress formed an alliance with the Kabaka's supporters
                    who included the overwhelming majority of Baganda. These had formed a political
                    grouping, which claimed that it was not a party exactly, but a movement called
                    Kabaka Yekka, meaning “Kabaka Forever.” It was a party of Kabaka supporters.
                    Obote very shrewdly...Obote had very shrewd advisers—Grace Ibingiro, for
                    example, George Kigese, etc...they advised him to try to form an alliance with
                    the Kabaka, which hitherto had been considered a highly unlikely event because
                    the two didn't see eye to eye on anything. The Kabaka was very conservative,
                    Obote considered himself a socialist.</p>
                <p>However, Obote was a shrewd politician and knew that to win the election for the
                    government that was going to take over after independence he needed the support
                    of the Baganda. So he formed his alliance with Kabaka Yekka. One of the things I
                    am happiest about in my own reporting is that I foresaw this merger at a time
                    when the people in the Department did not expect it. I predicted it and it came
                    about. It is not often that one's predictions come true, so one cherishes the
                    few times that they do occur.</p>
                <p>So the Kabaka Yekka/UPC alliance was formed and won an overwhelming majority and
                    was in position to take charge after independence ceremony. Actually they took
                    over before that on a preliminary basis. Obote became the first real prime
                    minister of independent Uganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is the one who had J.C. Simpson as economic
                        minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, Simpson was biracial, that is, he worked effectively with Africans
                    and British alike.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also Patel, the Indian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. I have forgotten which ministry he ran. Simpson was a very
                    friendly, intelligent businessman who worked very closely with both the Kabaka
                    and other people in Uganda. He was made their first Minister for Economic
                    Affairs. He was a good, able man.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>People have often asked me if I knew Idi Amin and whether he was a factor in
                    Uganda during my assignment there and I can say that he was not. He was then a
                    sergeant in the army. His chief fame was as former heavy weight boxing champion
                    of Uganda. I didn't even know of him as that because he was passe by the time I
                    arrived. There was another heavy weight champion named Okello, if I remember
                    correctly, who was given a thorough thrashing by one of the American Golden
                    Glove amateurs who came in to compete against Ugandan boxers. In fact the fellow
                    who gave him a thrashing was a light heavy weight named Martin. He wasn't even a
                    full fledged heavy weight. He eventually became a professional boxer in the
                    United States and did quite well.</p>
                <p>So Idi Amin was not in evidence. There was no way of knowing that he was going to
                    be appointed a general shortly after the British left. And there was no way for
                    me to predict that he was going to be the vehicle through whom Obote eventually
                    got rid of the Kabaka, forcing the Kabaka into exile. That whole episode was
                    after my time. I suppose we should have been able to predict it because of the
                    vast differences between Obote and the Kabaka. As I have said, the Kabaka was a
                    very arcane, mysterious sort of person. He spoke in oracular verse almost. You
                    had to interpret virtually everything he said and it could be done in many ways.
                    He knew his people and he worked underground, behind the scenes. He did not go
                    public, he was a manipulator. Obote was a political creature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What tribe did he come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: He was a Langi and came from Lira. I think he was of royal blood, but he
                    was not accepted at Budo College (the Eton of Uganda), if I remember correctly,
                    or perhaps he wasn't accepted at Oxford. In any event, this left a mark on him.
                    He had a perpetual chip on his shoulder. He always seemed suspicious. As he sat
                    in the legislative council, I would see him glaring out from under heavy eye
                    brows as his colleagues were talking. And yet when one got to know him he had an
                    appealing side to him. He had a warm smile and as with most politicians there
                    was something likable about him, otherwise he probably wouldn't have made it to
                    the top.</p>
                <p>One little personal episode. Shortly after the final election we had a party at
                    my house for Obote and his cabinet. One of my guests was Freddy Reinhardt who
                    was then U.S. Ambassador in Rome. He was on a hunting trip in Africa and was
                    ejected from his hotel because he didn't have the proper reservations. I heard
                    about it and invited him and his wife to stay with us. So he happened to be
                    there at the time. The whole cabinet came. When Obote entered the room he was
                    carrying the ubiquitous cane that all African leaders seem to carry as a token
                    of leadership, or scepter or mace of power. He came in with his cane and my
                    second son, who was then about six or seven at that time, spotted the cane. He
                    loved to play the part of Zorro with canes. He seized it as Obote came in the
                    door. Obote said, “Oh, no, no, you can't have that cane, but I will see to it
                    that you get a better one.”</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I had forgotten all about this and a few weeks later I was in Obote's office for
                    some reason or other, and he handed me a beautiful, white and blue beaded
                    ceremonial cane. He said that I should give that to my son in place of the one
                    he couldn't have. Which I did. That was a very nice thing for him to have
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does he still have it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, it's upstairs.</p>
                <p>Anyway Obote and the Kabaka were completely different personalities. The Kabaka
                    paraded in public, of course, and was revered when he paraded. People planted
                    palm fronds and that sort of thing and bowed down before him. But this was
                    ceremonial. Obote was a politician. He made speeches in the legislative council.
                    He was a power hungry, ambitious person. We should have foreseen that Kabaka and
                    Obote could not really function together as a working team. The Kabaka would
                    never accept Obote's prominence and Obote would always resent anything the
                    Kabaka did behind his back. You must understand that an African leader probably
                    is in the mode of traditional African chiefs. An African leader is in effect a
                    tribal chief. Everything goes through him. Everything is decided by him. He
                    wants to know everything that goes on right down to the dotting of an i and
                    crossing of a t. I guess we should have known that Obote would never accept the
                    behind-the-scenes maneuvering at which the Kabaka was so adept. Even if the
                    Kabaka was doing nothing harmful, Obote would consider the mere fact that he was
                    doing something that he (Obote) hadn't authorized in advance and hadn't been
                    briefed on thoroughly, would be suspicious, and would assume that the Kabaka
                    must be doing something that would undermine his position as prime minister.
                    And, indeed, maybe the Kabaka was undermining him.</p>
                <p>Now continuing along these lines, we should have been able to predict that Langi
                    and Baganda would never get along. While the British were in control such
                    animosities were submerged in the greater aim of striving for independence and
                    then preparing for independence and getting the government set up. But once the
                    British had left, these animosities came to the forefront and indeed ruined the
                    country. But this was all after I had left. We hoped that the animosities would
                    remain submerged and indeed in the day-to-day functioning of the government,
                    while I was there, they seemed to be in abeyance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had every reason to hope?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, all these people seemed to be friendly with each other. Even Ben
                    Kiwanuka, the minority leader, was accepted. He would raise Cain with the
                    opposition in the parliamentary proceedings, but then at the tea break the two
                    sides would sip tea and joke with each other. Things seemed to be harmonious,
                    like a little London House of Commons.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was just a copy, it wasn't the real thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: As soon as the British left animosities must have started to build and
                    that is for somebody else to relate because it didn't take place during my time.
                    But it is so sad that it had to develop that way, because the way things were
                    developing while I was there seemed almost ideal and one could see all sorts of
                    hopeful signs.</p>
                <p>One of the hopeful signs, for example, was the position of the Indians who were a
                    distinct minority, but a very well-to-do minority. There were at least three
                    special Indian groups. The first was the Indian Ishmaili, the followers of the
                    Aga Khan. They had their own school and were prominent in Kampala. They were
                    very well-to-do, had much of the business in that area, were socially eminent
                    and seemed to be accepted by all. The other two groups were the Mehta group,
                    which owned huge sugar plantations in Uganda, and the Madvani group which was
                    also in sugar, steel and other industries. Both Mehta and Madvani were highly
                    educated, rich, intelligent and attractive Indians. They were well treated and
                    an integral part of the economy. There was no reason to believe that Idi Amin,
                    later when he was in control, would kick them all out of Uganda. I understand
                    that now under Museveni that “Sugar” Mehta is going or has gone back to Uganda.
                    I think Madvani has died, but I don't know for sure. But treatment of Indians is
                    another thing that seemed to be going positively in my day, but turned out
                    badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other particular characters of interest you
                        can tell us about who were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well it is hard to know where to begin and where to stop. One of the
                    more interesting personages was Prince George of Toro, the Omukama of Toro. He
                    was the equivalent of the Kabaka of Buganda, but his bailiwick was Toro, a
                    province in the western part of Uganda—a beautiful part of the world. Now George
                    of Toro was no Kabaka. His “palace” was a relatively small house. He had
                    attendants and a “court” and he was respected, but he had no real power except
                    socially. He was very amusing. He was a great drinker, loved his champaign. I
                    remember once going to visit him and he was lying in bed with his bandaged foot
                    stretched out on the counterpane saying, “Look at me, gout. I am immobilized by
                    gout.” He had a great sense of humor. He had been to the States, I think on a
                    Leader Grant. But in any event he had formed a close friendship with an American
                    wrestler. He was very much interested in wrestling. He was a big fellow himself
                    and probably would have been a good wrestler if he had ever tried it. His main
                    claim to fame was that he was the father of Elizabeth of Toro, who eventually
                    became Ugandan Ambassador to the United States and also, eventually Foreign
                    Minister for a brief period under Idi Amin, who treated her abominably. He
                    accused her of all sorts of terrible things, one being that she had sexual
                    intercourse with somebody in the bathroom of an airport. It was the sort of
                    thing that he did. She was a highly intelligent, very good looking young woman
                    who made a name for herself in her own right. I don't know what has happened to
                    her since. His son, Stephen was also well-known. George, I am afraid has passed
                    on. A very amusing, nice person and of royal blood, in African terms.</p>
                <p>There are other interesting people, John Babiho. He was a mountain climber. He
                    had climbed the Mountains of the Moon more frequently than any other living
                    being. One time an American trying to climb the Mountains developed pneumonia,
                    fell hurting his lung and had to be evacuated from the mountain. John Babiho was
                    one of the men who helped to evacuate him. He eventually became minister of
                    forestry or something like that in the Obote government.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, there was Godfrey Binaisa, who was attorney general under Obote.
                    He was a close friend of the Consulate General while we were there. A very
                    bright person. He became president after Vincent Lule, who had taken over after
                    Idi Amin was deposed with the help of Tanzanian soldiers. Godfrey Binaisa lasted
                    for a very short time. Then there was an election. Obote was voted back in from
                    his exile in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>There was one man I want to mention whom I thought a great deal of and that was
                    Dowdi Ocheng. He was an Acholi, the brother of Martin Aliker. Martin Aliker was
                    a dentist who had been educated in the United States at Northwestern University
                    and who married a black American from Louisville, Kentucky. He was a very
                    well-known, able dentist and a very close friend to all of us. In fact, we went
                    to him for our dental work. He was also a dabbler in real estate and made a
                    fortune by combining his dental practice with his real estate ventures. He
                    became a good friend of Obote and was best man at Obote's wedding. This was
                    after I left. Eventually he went to Kenya where he practiced dentistry and made
                    a fortune.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>But his brother Dowdi Ocheng was a politician by trade. He was from Acholi and a
                    member of the Ugandan parliament. He was one of those who really opposed the
                    Obote coup that kicked out the Kabaka. He was an idealist and very courageous.
                    He eventually died of cancer, but he made very forthright speeches in parliament
                    in opposition to what Obote was doing. If he hadn't died of cancer I am sure
                    that he would have been slaughtered by Idi Amin because he was too outspoken and
                    too courageous. He loved to talk about politics. I used to have great
                    conversations with him. He was very informative.</p>
                <p>Another one I might mention is Abu Mayanja, a small, slender fellow, who was very
                    prominent in the independence movement before I got to Uganda. I met him in the
                    States before leaving for Kampala. He told stories about leading demonstrations
                    and how he was arrested at one point by the British, who ripped off his shirt
                    and marched him half naked off to jail in front of others who had been arrested.
                    He was upset at that. But I think he had to work hard at being a martyr. He
                    didn't stay in jail very long. When he came out he joined the Kabaka's camp and
                    became a member of the Kabaka's cabinet. He was a good friend and one of the few
                    persons who later wrote me a nice letter of condolence at the assassination of
                    Kennedy when I was stationed in Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>Another person of interest was Michael Kintu who was Katikiro, or prime minister
                    in the Kabaka's government. He was unimpressive looking, resembling a big,
                    inflated frog. He didn't say much but he controlled the Kabaka's government with
                    an iron hand. He was a very warm-hearted person underneath it all. I remember
                    seeing him at a church gathering during the Christmas season. The children were
                    putting on a play about Joseph and his multicolored coat...and it was very
                    moving. Kintu was weeping while he was watching the kids act. I never knew he
                    had that much sentiment. It was a moving performance, I remember that.</p>
                <p>Grace Ibingiro was another one I might mention. He was of royal blood, related to
                    the Omugabi of Ankole who was in turn related to Rwanda aristocracy. Grace
                    Ibingiro was very young, still unmarried. He was an artist, a good painter and a
                    very clever person. He was a close associate of Obote and he was the one who
                    really engineered the Kabaka Yekka/UPC alliance behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>Another man I would like to mention is Basil Bataringaya, a very honorable,
                    honest, likeable politician. He was, I think, the minister of interior in
                    Obote's first cabinet. Later, he was slaughtered by Idi Amin. A good friend,
                    very fine, intelligent and well-educated.</p>
                <p>One thing that I took away from Uganda was the realization of how charming
                    African political leaders can be. How well educated some of them are. How bright
                    they are. They need no help from us in political astuteness. They sometimes
                    don't know all that much about economics, but in terms of how to gain
                    popularity, how to gain power, how to keep power, they don't need our help. They
                    can teach us lessons.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I was very happy to be in Uganda, in fact at my first party there...they have a
                    habit of making you say a few words and you have to think of something decent to
                    say. I was not prepared for this because it was my first party. I said, “I am
                    delighted to be here. This is the one place in the world I most want to be, and
                    I mean this sincerely.” And I did mean it. I never changed my mind. I was always
                    happy to be there. It was a pleasant assignment from beginning to end. The only
                    thing less than pleasant about it was that I had to leave before the
                    independence ceremony. I was very upset and annoyed about the timing. I didn't
                    think it was necessary to take me out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they take you out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: They took me out because my successor was to be the Ambassador-designate
                    and in those days President Kennedy often changed his mind at the last minute,
                    so if one got an ambassadorial appointment, he took it and ran to the post as
                    quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a career person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. I will never really forgive him for this because he was my Desk
                    officer in Washington at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He insisted on being there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: He insisted on getting out to Kampala as soon as he could. It seemed to
                    me in retrospect that he might easily have waited a couple of weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that you had been there during the preparation...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Or at least it could have been arranged so that I could have stayed to
                    take part in the final stage of the independence process that I had followed so
                    closely. At that time, nobody in Uganda could make any sense of my removal. They
                    didn't realize that it was just my time to go, an ordinary change in
                    assignments. They wondered whether my departure indicated a change in U.S.
                    policy toward Uganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To them it was an upset of the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is right, they couldn't understand it. Also, it wasn't explained to
                    me at the time; not until my successor actually arrived did I get a full
                    explanation. Of course, he wanted the job, got it and wanted to get out to his
                    post before anyone changed his assignment. I just resented that I couldn't see
                    the job finished. Anyway, that was the only negative thing.</p>
                <p>And in general, I might make this statement: our Foreign Service is excellent in
                    preparing people going to places, but is not very good in the way it removes
                    people from posts. What they should realize is that when a person has been in a
                    place for two or three years and has done a reasonably decent job and built up
                    knowledge of the country and a lot of people know him, he should be just as
                    careful in how he leaves as he was in preparing himself for arrival. He should
                    make sure that everybody understands why he left and he should be able to
                    prepare the way for his successor.</p>
                <p>This really was not permitted me in Uganda. I don't think anybody was consciously
                    doing me in, I just think it was a thoughtless way of changing the guard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't you asked to stay on after independence before
                        this person...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That was the whole point. I guess I should have explained it a little
                    more thoroughly. Henry Tasca, who was then Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs, came to Nairobi about six months before my departure from
                    Kampala. I was summoned there to brief him because he couldn't come up to
                    Uganda. After the briefing, he said that the Department wanted me to stay on in
                    Kampala after independence to be Charg� and asked whether I would be willing to
                    do that even if it meant postponing home leave. I said I would be delighted to
                    do it. He said, “Well, we will expect you to stay on until about April 1963.”
                    Later, I got a copy of the Department's notice to the British government asking
                    for their agr�ment for me as Charg�, and I was informed of this by Wally Coutes,
                    then Governor of Uganda. The British accepted my appointment. It wasn't that I
                    expected to be reassigned, on the contrary I expected to be in Uganda an
                    additional six months.</p>
                <p>So it came as a complete surprise around August 1962 when I got a letter from
                    Governor Williams saying that the Department was reassigning me and that I would
                    be sent back home to be Desk officer for South African Affairs. There was no
                    explanation other than that, no reference to my Charg�ship or the agr�ment. I
                    couldn't understand this. I didn't know at that point whether there had been a
                    change of policy or what. Nobody really explained it to me.</p>
                <p>So that accounts for my pique, apart from being upset because I couldn't attend
                    the independence ceremony and see all the people I had been working with reach
                    the stage that they had all looked forward to with such eagerness.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>And that is why I believe the Department is not always as good at ending a man's
                    old assignment as it is in preparing him for taking on a new one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Continuing the interview of Hendrik Van Oss reporting his
                        experiences in his assignment to Wellington, New Zealand, from July 1968 to
                        November 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I was assigned to the American Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand in
                    1968 as Deputy Chief of Mission after having completed the Senior Seminar course
                    at FSI. I was, therefore, refreshed and full of vim and vigor. I arrived there
                    is July 1968. My Ambassador was John Henning, who was a Democratic Party
                    political appointee. He had been Assistant Secretary of Labor. He had been a
                    prominent official with the AFL-CIO. His orientation was labor union. But he was
                    one of the best political appointee ambassadors I have ever served with and as
                    far as New Zealand was concerned, probably one of the most effective American
                    Ambassadors ever to have served there.</p>
                <p>New Zealand was a wonderful country to be in. It is a beautiful country as
                    everybody knows. For anybody who likes hiking, athletics, outdoors, beautiful
                    scenery, a pleasant climate, it is an absolutely perfect spot. As a Foreign
                    Service assignment, professionally, it is not all that interesting. There was no
                    warfare, no adversaries to worry about, no political upheavals, no communist
                    threat.</p>
                <p>Our main concern in New Zealand was with the unfavorable balance of trade. New
                    Zealand sold us more than we sold them. New Zealand's main exports to the U.S.
                    were wool, dairy and meat products, and later on of course Kiwi fruit, although
                    the last had not yet arrived on the scene...we were eating it in Wellington but
                    they had not started exporting it in any great quantity when I was there.</p>
                <p>Instead of security matters, the main thing to worry about was whether New
                    Zealanders were going to export too much cheddar into the United States and thus
                    exceed the quota limits that we had imposed upon such imports. This led to a
                    rather interesting bit of activity. The New Zealanders would develop a new
                    cheese that was just like cheddar, except that it had certain ingredients that
                    were not in our quota's definition of cheddar...just enough to take it out of
                    the cheddar nomenclature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would they give it a new name as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, of course. They would call it something else and send it to the
                    United States. U.S. officialdom would eventually cotton to this, would analyze
                    the new cheese and find that it actually was just like cheddar with these very,
                    very minor variations. We would then alter the regulations so that the new
                    cheese would fall under the cheddar quota limitations. Whereupon New Zealand
                    would start all over again with yet another “new” cheese with a few different
                    elements in it that took the new product out of the cheddar designation, and the
                    U.S. would in turn widen the definition of cheddar, and so it continued.</p>
                <p>Also we ran into problems with beef. We had worked out a system with the New
                    Zealanders whereby if they came within 110 percent of a certain limit to the
                    quantity of beef exported to the U.S. this would trigger a situation in which
                    the U.S. would automatically apply quotas on the amount of beef New Zealand
                    would be allowed to export to us. They always kept their beef sales under that
                    limit to avoid the imposition of quotas.</p>
                <p>The export of young New Zealand lamb to the U.S. was not under any quota,
                    although our own American sheep producers were anxious to limit lamb imports, so
                    New Zealand could send us all the lamb we could take, without the risk of
                    falling under a quota.</p>
                <p>New Zealand, is a beautiful country. It has more sheep per capita than any other
                    place in the world. Its human population has remained fairly steady around 3
                    million, and the sheep population ranges anywhere from 30 to 60 million. You are
                    talking about 10 to 20 sheep per capita.</p>
                <p>The climate in New Zealand is so mild, even in the winter, that grass grows all
                    year around. They grow grass everywhere in the North Island, including the tops
                    of high hills. So, wherever one walks one finds grass, and wherever one walks
                    one finds sheep.</p>
                <p>New Zealand is where I learned how to “right” a “cast” sheep, if you know what
                    that is. A “cast” sheep is a pregnant ewe that falls, gets on its side and can't
                    get up. If somebody doesn't help it get up it eventually dies from starvation.
                    The sheep are not tended daily, they are rounded up every couple of months or
                    so. So, whenever you were walking and saw a cast sheep, the gentlemanly thing to
                    do was to get it on its feet.</p>
                <p>New Zealand has every conceivable type of scenic beauty. On the North Island
                    there are verdant hills, a couple of volcanoes and thermal springs. It has windy
                    weather...Wellington is one of the windiest places in the world. I would say an
                    average wind during a typical day is about 40 miles per hour. The winds can get
                    so strong that they knock you off your feet if you are on top of a hill. On the
                    South Island there are mountains and glaciers much like Switzerland. It is
                    closer to the Antarctic so the weather is much colder than on North Island,
                    being very similar to that of Scotland.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>It is a truism to say that New Zealand is one of the more British of the British
                    Commonwealth areas. New Zealanders consider England their home. They are
                    patriotic New Zealanders at the same time, but they still look to England as
                    their mother country. The women curtsy to the Governor General's wife and all
                    that sort of thing. And, yet, they are very democratic, admirable people in
                    every respect. They are plain spoken, don't accept tips, or didn't while I was
                    there, except maybe in some of the tourist hotels. They are very informal, don't
                    like pretense, are easy to get along with, love to be talked to and to talk.</p>
                <p>A foreign diplomat, if he allowed himself to do it, could easily be invited to
                    speak every day of the week. Every type of club exists in New Zealand: Lions,
                    Rotary, etc. My experience was that whenever I was asked to speak...let's say at
                    a Lions Club...I would typically be told in advance that my speech was to be no
                    longer than 20 minutes. After I arrived, we would have dinner and then the
                    audience would start off and get completely involved in their own club
                    activities...levying fines on members who had done something they shouldn't have
                    done, cracking jokes, or making references to local business...so that by the
                    time it was my turn to speak, the chairman would say, “Now, Mr. Van Oss is here
                    to give us very brief remarks,” and then stage whisper to me, “No longer than
                    seven minutes.” So I would have to compress my 20 minutes into 7. My audience
                    always accepted whatever I said very amiably and I was always given a thank you
                    speech in return which often tended to be longer than the abbreviated speech I
                    had given.</p>
                <p>As I say, New Zealand was not terribly interesting professionally. The politics
                    were quite unremarkable, although there was a lively adversarial relationship
                    between the National (Conservative) Party and the Labor Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Conservatives were in when you got there, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That is right. The Nationals were in and Keith Holyoke was the prime
                    minister. A very fine man, very unpretentious. He had a rather pompous way of
                    talking, but was really a very humble person. He had no servants, for example,
                    in his house. His salary was something on the order of $17,000 a year,
                    practically nothing as such things go. When he entertained, he did so in his own
                    house, and his wife did the cooking. It was a very relaxed situation.</p>
                <p>It was easier to get to know New Zealanders and get on friendly terms with them
                    than in any other place I have served.</p>
                <p>As I have indicated, in John Henning we had a very fine political ambassador who
                    was a superb public speaker and a very quick learner. He was not well versed in
                    the ways of the Foreign Service, so his DCM had to run the daily operations of
                    the Embassy, although the Ambassador kept a sharp eye on everything and was a
                    working ambassador, not someone who stayed out of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Basically, as DCM, I saw and initialed all outgoing messages except the most
                    routine ones; administrative stuff and the like. I was busy because I knew the
                    ropes having been in charge of various posts and having been deputy chief of
                    mission before. Henning was a very sympathetic and pleasant ambassador to work
                    for.</p>
                <p>The work was not terribly difficult. The political situation was easy.
                    Developments were not very profound or complicated and we had able officers both
                    on the economic and political side. There were no consular problems that caused
                    much of a stir. We had an able USIS and a CIA station, which mainly was there to
                    exchange information with its opposites in New Zealand intelligence. So far as I
                    was aware it did not engage in clandestine activities as such. It had a very
                    close relationship with the New Zealanders. As you recall New Zealand was one of
                    our allies in the Vietnamese war. They had sent a medical unit to Vietnam, so in
                    return we gave them all of the information we had on matters pertaining to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Henning was extremely popular with the New Zealanders. He was a great fan of
                    rugby, the national pastime. He went to a rugby match every weekend and
                    afterwards would go down into the locker room and join players and fans. He
                    didn't drink anything alcoholic, but managed to mask that successfully in the
                    beer drinking environment of a rugby locker room. He would say a few appropriate
                    words, and was accepted as one of the gang. In fact, he was so much a part of
                    New Zealand life that he was asked to give the main speech on ANZAC Day, the
                    anniversary of the Gallipoli disaster during World War I. He gave a great speech
                    which was broadcast throughout the country. He was an orator of the old school.
                    He spoke without notes, memorized everything that he was going to say but gave
                    the impression of speaking extemporaneously. He was really a highly successful
                    ambassador in every respect.</p>
                <p>His successor was appointed after the election of Nixon. You recall that Johnson
                    didn't run in 1968 and Nixon and Humphrey ran a close race. Shortly after
                    Nixon's succession to power, Henning was replaced by a young man from Kentucky
                    named Kenneth Franzheim. A nice young man in his early 40s, if that old. He had
                    inherited a fortune from an architect father and his grandfather who had owned a
                    well-known Kentucky stable of race horses. He had augmented his fortune
                    considerably by dealing in oil real estate. So he had a considerable personal
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>He came with a very glamorous wife who had been editor of Vogue magazine. A
                    startlingly good looking, black haired lady who dressed in the latest fashion
                    and created quite a stir because of the insufficiency of some of the garb that
                    she wore on several formal occasions. It didn't cover as much as some of the
                    more conservative New Zealand ladies thought proper.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Franzheim was on the opposite end of the spectrum from Henning as ambassador. He
                    was a nice man and did his best, but he had had no experience in the public
                    arena. He had never made a public speech, and was not a particularly good
                    reader, so we couldn't expect him to read a speech effectively.</p>
                <p>One of the things he did expertly was buy race horses. He got along well with the
                    racing crowd. He also bought a lot of antiques, and was criticized by some for
                    throwing his money around. I don't think this was anything he did
                    ostentatiously, but he just was used to spending a lot of money. Since I left
                    before he did I do not know how he was regarded ultimately by New Zealanders,
                    but I can say with pretty complete assurance he was not as popular as his
                    predecessor.</p>
                <p>It was an entirely different experience working with Franzheim because it was
                    like having to break in a new Foreign Service officer, except that he was in
                    charge. This was not as easy as it might have been.</p>
                <p>The things that interested me as much as New Zealand itself were some of the
                    adjuncts to what we had to do in New Zealand proper. The Ambassador was also
                    accredited to Western Samoa, an independent island country that had formerly
                    been under New Zealand mandate since right after World War I. I was fortunate in
                    making several trips to Western Samoa, which fascinated me. First of all because
                    of its association with Robert Louis Stevenson, who lived there in Vailima, as
                    his house was called, and who is buried on top of a hill (Mount Vaea) right
                    behind Vailima. In fact, I visited his grave. I got to know Tanumafili Malietoa,
                    the president of Western Samoa, who was the hereditary head of state. The
                    Samoans were very nice people and I was their main American contact in
                    Wellington, so I had the pleasure of going there several times. I stayed at the
                    famous hotel of Aggie Gray, a very colorful old lady of considerable fame who
                    was still very much alive. She was probably in her seventies, but in her day
                    during World War II she had run a boarding house establishment for U.S. Air
                    Force and other officers. Some people claimed that she was the model for Bloody
                    Mary in Michener's “Tales of South Pacific.” But I don't believe it, because
                    Bloody Mary was a sort of half caste islander and procurer, whereas Aggie Gray
                    was a very dignified lady, well dressed, seemingly well-educated, well-spoken
                    certainly. To be at her hotel was the essence of South Sea Island living. Just a
                    delight, and still is from what I hear.</p>
                <p>We also had watching briefs on other islands, Tonga and the Cook Islands. I never
                    got to the Cook Islands but did get to Tonga and Fiji. That was always fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Another thing that we did in New Zealand...Christchurch was the headquarters of
                    the U.S. Naval force that ran our operation in the Antarctic. One of my duties
                    was to help take care of problems that arose between our forces on the Antarctic
                    and the New Zealand government. This was not any great diplomatic feat. It
                    usually amounted to trying to get certain naval personnel out of jail for having
                    done something in an inebriated moment, trying to persuade the New Zealand
                    authorities to go easy on them without offending their sense of sovereignty. And
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>The Antarctic itself was a highly fascinating place and I was lucky to be invited
                    to go down for a week by the commanding officer, Admiral Kelly Welch. I stayed
                    in his quarters along with the Admiral's brother who was visiting also at that
                    time. We were the only two guests so I was privileged to have a real Cook's tour
                    of the Antarctic, which is one of the most fascinating places in the world. In
                    fact, so fascinating that I was sorely tempted to resign from the Foreign
                    Service, join the National Science Foundation and try to get myself down there.
                    But one of the things that kept me from doing this apart from my eternal love
                    for the Foreign Service, was the fact that I knew nothing about science and
                    didn't think I could learn quickly enough to be of any great use on the ice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on the New Zealanders became very active in
                        anti-Vietnam war stance, especially the young people. What was the climate
                        like when you were there between 1968-70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, remember that during my entire tour the National (Conservative)
                    government was in charge. Keith Holyoke was prime minister and he and his
                    cohorts were very much in favor of our intervention in Vietnam and as I told you
                    we had an extensive exchange of intelligence on Vietnam matters. However, the
                    beginnings of anti-Vietnam sentiment were coming into evidence, particularly in
                    the universities, among the younger people. Also, to a lesser extent, among some
                    of the Labor Party ministers. While the National Party had the majority of the
                    ministerial posts, there were a number of Labor Party ministers as well. One of
                    them in particular was very vocal in his opposition to American intervention in
                    Vietnam. So much so that when the New Zealand elections approached as I was
                    ending my tour, it occurred to some of us that if the Labor Party won, we might
                    have to rethink our policy of exchanging highly classified information with them
                    because of their attitude towards our activities in Vietnam. Fortunately this
                    question did not come up during my stay there.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>However, this business recalls to mind the visit to New Zealand, after the
                    election of President Nixon, of Vice President Agnew. I think this is worth a
                    word or two. I was on leave in the South Island and planning a hike with my
                    family on the Milford track, one of the most famous hikes in the world which
                    takes several days and nights. You take a plane from Queenstown, then hike over
                    a mountain track for several days sleeping in huts and end up at a beautiful
                    fjord, Milford Sound. We were just about to start on the trek when I got a
                    telegram at our motel in Queenstown saying, “Return to Embassy at once. Vice
                    President Agnew is arriving on such and such a date.” So I had to leave my
                    family, who carried on with the Milford track hike, and return to Wellington to
                    prepare for Agnew.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you, preparing for a presidential or even vice presidential visit is
                    no bed of roses. First of all the White House sends out an advanced party of
                    security men, who are unsmiling, down to earth, ruthless, lacking in sense of
                    humor individuals, obsessed with the safety of their chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And never to be pleased.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, never to be pleased. They make demands that no self-respecting
                    sovereign nation will ever accept, but they make them nonetheless. Even to the
                    point of insisting that Agnew ride in his own armored vehicle, which, of course,
                    the New Zealanders would not have accepted had I brought the matter up with
                    them.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Agnew arrived and actually was quite a success. He made some very good
                    speeches, was very calm and well-behaved. He didn't make any untold demands and
                    the New Zealanders were quite impressed with him. In fact, they called him back
                    to the podium again informally after he had made his prepared remarks.</p>
                <p>He brought Bill Rogers with him, who was then Secretary of State, and at the
                    dinner in Agnew's honor one of the New Zealanders asked Rogers whether Jack
                    Henning couldn't remain as ambassador...whether Nixon would confirm that he
                    would remain as ambassador. Bill Rogers said, “Well, no, we are going to appoint
                    somebody who will be even better than Jack Henning.” That wasn't a very polite
                    thing to say because Henning was right there during the whole business.</p>
                <p>Apart from that, Agnew was a great success but I still will never forgive him for
                    having disrupted my Milford track venture because I never had a chance to make
                    the trek after that. I would still like to do it some day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't the Queen come to New Zealand while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, she did. She made a visit with Princess Anne, but I must confess I
                    am very hazy on this. I don't think it made too much of an impression on me then
                    and I certainly don't remember much about it now.</p>
                <p>One thing I would like to talk about though is the Maori. The Maori, of course,
                    are the indigenous people of New Zealand, although they are not all that
                    indigenous. They came there themselves only in the 11th century, if I remember
                    correctly. A great deal of material has been written about how they arrived...in
                    large canoes bringing with them the dogs, rats and other mammals that didn't
                    exist on the islands before that time.</p>
                <p>The Maori, I suppose could be likened to the American Indians. They are a small
                    minority, probably several hundred thousand. They are a strong, warlike
                    Polynesian group. Where they originally came from is not absolutely clear; some
                    think from the neighborhood of Samoa, others think they may have come all the
                    way from the Hawaiian Islands. The New Zealanders considered themselves experts
                    at dealing with the Maori. Of course they had pitched battles as recently as the
                    late 19th and early 20th centuries, comparable to our Indian wars. The Maori
                    were thoroughly conquered but never completely absorbed.</p>
                <p>They inhibit certain areas of the country...around Rotorua for instance, which is
                    the main thermal spring area on the North Island. New Zealanders consider
                    themselves to be very adept at racial relations. They thought, when I was there,
                    that they had solved the racial conflict, but I can assure you that they hadn't.
                    Their attitude was extremely patronizing...”Oh, the Maoris are good chaps, you
                    know. They are quite intelligent.” That type of thing. But they did accept them
                    all over the place. They weren't excluded from any activity. A number of them
                    were in Parliament. A Maori eventually became New Zealand High Commissioner in
                    London and a number of them were knighted. I have in my library some books by
                    Maori authors.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I got to know one of them quite well, Kara Puketapu, who was the son of one of
                    the Maori leaders in the Wellington area clan. He had studied in the United
                    States at the University of New Mexico. While there, through the Ford Foundation
                    he had arranged an exchange of American Indians and Maori. Several years before
                    I arrived on the scene, Maori had gone to the United States, been taken into the
                    various Indian reservations and had seen what they were like. While I was in
                    Wellington about a dozen American Indians came over and were taken through all
                    the Maori areas. This was quite an eye opener for me because what few contacts I
                    had with American Indians up to then (and I had had some contacts because during
                    my assignment in the Senior Seminar I had done my paper on the place of the
                    American Indian in American Foreign Relations). When I had visited American
                    Indian reservations, the Indians had been fairly straight laced, self absorbed,
                    solemn, fairly quiet, not outspoken in any way that I could see. But these 12
                    Indians from various tribes...there was a Zuni, a Mohawk, etc...entered into the
                    spirit of things with great aplomb and enthusiasm. They turned out to be highly
                    sociable, great wits. They danced with the Maori, embraced them, sang with them
                    and seemed to be having a wonderful time. They had discussions with the Maori
                    intelligentsia while they exchanged information on their experience in the
                    United States and the Maori experience in New Zealand.</p>
                <p>The one thing that struck me was a remark one of the Maori made after a long
                    discussion on culture. He said something to the effect that you Indians have
                    kept your culture in the reservations, whereas our problem is we are so much
                    involved in the schools and life in New Zealand that we don't know when to start
                    injecting Maori culture into our children. That seemed to mark an important
                    difference between the two groups. The American Indians were still immersed in
                    their own culture while the Maori were thoroughly New Zealandized, but trying at
                    the same time to cling to their culture despite that.</p>
                <p>The Maori add color, life and diversity to the New Zealand scene. There isn't a
                    celebration in New Zealand that isn't marked with some sort of Maori
                    performance...various types of dances, Hakas, singing, chanting, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left New Zealand in November 1970. Did you have an
                        onward assignment at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, yes. I thought I was coming back to New Zealand at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you were going on home leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: No, it was a little more complicated than that. It was to have been a
                    four year assignment, I thought. I was getting ready for home leave after the
                    first two years, but then my mother became extremely ill so I had to leave
                    suddenly about a month early in November 1969. Just before I left I learned that
                    I would not be reassigned to New Zealand, but there was no indication as to
                    where I was going to be sent. So it was only after I got back to the Department
                    that I learned I would be going to Mozambique, which was not an assignment that
                    I sought, although I did indicate that I would prefer to have a post of my own,
                    however small, rather than go out as DCM again. I always felt in the Foreign
                    Service that it is the golden time when you have your own post because no matter
                    how small or insignificant, it is your responsibility and you sink or swim. You
                    have a chance to make a little mark, perhaps, that you don't otherwise make when
                    you are just one of a larger group in an Embassy.</p>
                <p>I must say that I was lucky in my Foreign Service career in having several posts
                    of my own. Those are the ones that I think I enjoyed, all in all, more than the
                    others. Although I enjoyed the others too, so I really can't say that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 16, 1992 and this is a continuing interview
                        with Hendrik Van Oss concerning his Foreign Service career. Mr. Van Oss you
                        served in Vienna from 1953 to 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I was assigned to Vienna right after Kuala Lumpur arriving there in
                    November 1953. We stayed there until November 1956. I was assigned there as
                    Transport and Communications Officer which was somewhat of a mystery to me
                    because I never thought I knew anything about either transport or
                    communications. I questioned the assignment and was assured that the powers to
                    be knew what they were doing. I am not sure to this day that they did, but in
                    any event the assignment stuck.</p>
                <p>So as an unwilling economic officer I went off to Vienna. In those days Vienna
                    was still occupied and I won't go through all that because it is part of
                    well-known history. But briefly, the four occupying allied powers (U.S., Great
                    Britain, France and USSR) each had a section of Austria and each had a section
                    of Vienna. Then there was an international section in the middle of Vienna which
                    was governed on a monthly basis by each of the occupying powers in rotation. To
                    get to Vienna we had to go through a corridor from the American sector, which
                    ended around Linz, through the Soviet sector into Vienna.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I found this assignment a somewhat humbling experience because in Kuala Lumpur I
                    had been the officer in charge and while it was a small post it was a very
                    exciting one, and a lot was going on. I was part of and on top of anything that
                    was happening. I was the main American representative. Whereas in Vienna I was
                    one of about several hundred members of the U.S. High Commission. Our
                    Ambassador, Tommy Thompson, was High Commissioner. My exact position was
                    Alternate Representative on the Quadripartite Signals (Communications)
                    Committee, Transport Directorate and Air Directorate. That meant in effect that
                    I sat in on Four Power Directorate meetings in those three categories of
                    activities.</p>
                <p>As I say I had no previous knowledge about any of these spheres. On civil air, in
                    the early days, I was under a chap named Tom Carter, a very experienced civil
                    aviation attach�. I learned a lot from him. But on transport and communications,
                    railroads, post offices, etc...I was on my own. My only consolation being that
                    nobody else at the Embassy knew much about these subjects either. Also, I had
                    U.S. military people who were in theory under me, but who actually ran the
                    operations in those respective areas in the U.S. zone of occupation.</p>
                <p>Dealing first with the one I knew the least about, the Quadripartite Signals
                    Committee, I don't remember too much about the details. I had a local employee,
                    an Austrian national, who knew all about the subject and helped me greatly. I
                    remember going to see the Austrian Post Office Director and being given a book
                    of Austrian postage stamps, which I still have to this day. The only thing worth
                    reporting is that we had, by Quadripartite agreement, the right to inspect the
                    telephone underground terminals which were in the Soviet zone under guard of the
                    Soviet occupying powers. I remember going down with an American Colonel who was
                    my deputy for this activity and an expert on communications...going down into
                    the bowels of the earth under Vienna and seeing what seemed like mile after mile
                    of cables and all sorts of electronic terminals and other equipment. I was
                    trying to look knowledgeable. We “inspected” these facilities in order to retain
                    our legal right to do so. If we had not exerted this right on occasion the
                    Soviets might have tried to prevent us from doing it at all on the grounds that
                    we hadn't shown any interest. So we inspected periodically.</p>
                <p>On the Transport Directorate, the main thing we had to worry about was the
                    Austrian railroad system. Here also I was in complete ignorance of what I was
                    doing, except what I could pick up on the spot. Again I had military people
                    helping me, people far more experienced in railroad management than I. But I was
                    the representative of the Quadripartite Committee so in theory any negotiating
                    that was done on the subject of railroads was my responsibility. We used to take
                    inspection trips on the railroad. We would get the Austrian Director of
                    Railroads' personal, private car and go tootling all over the railroad lines in
                    the American occupied zone. There wasn't too much to inspect because all you see
                    were railroad tracks and if the train slowed down for some reason or other I
                    would try to look knowledgeable as if I knew what was happening, but I
                    didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>The only other thing worth mentioning on these inspection trips was the
                    extraordinary amount of food that we were expected to eat. I forgot to mention
                    that the Director of Railroads, Maximilian Schantl, accompanied us—after all it
                    was his railroad car. All the people at the various railroad stations we stopped
                    at regarded him as their chief and they feasted, wined and beered him and the
                    rest of us. We might have two full dinners in the space of an hour and a half.
                    It reached the point that the American Colonel with me protested most
                    vociferously and not too tactfully that the food situation was becoming
                    intolerable. I found it equally so, but managed to maintain a certain degree of
                    diplomatic acceptance of all this stuff. I suppose we all put on about eight
                    pounds apiece as a result of these trips.</p>
                <p>Another thing of interest I don't remember too much about it although I did quite
                    a bit of work on it at the time, was the Danube River. I worked with a chap by
                    the name of Huber, if I remember correctly, who was head of the Waterways
                    Department in the Ministry of Transport. The main thing of interest to report is
                    that one of my colleagues at the Embassy, Paul Smith, and I took a trip from
                    Passau, on the German border, down to Vienna in a zille, which is a cross
                    between a canoe and a row boat. We paddled the whole distance. It took us about
                    four days. We stayed at inns on the banks of the Danube on the way down. That
                    gave us a good insight into the atmospherics of what was going on. I remember in
                    one little inn at which we stopped, there were a number of working people who
                    were eating there. We struck up a conversation with them. I was not fluent in
                    German, but certainly had a useful knowledge of it and had no need for
                    interpreters. We were asking these workmen about their political views and it
                    turned out they were all National Socialists, Nazis. They said they were keeping
                    their heads below the horizon for the moment, but expected their day to come
                    again. There was no question about that. I must say that this was the only place
                    that I saw neo-Nazi manifestations during my tour in Austria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were on this interesting four-day paddling trip
                        on the Danube, do you remember whether there was much freight traffic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Frankly, I don't remember any. There may have been a barge or two that
                    slipped by without our paying much attention to it. There were ferries that
                    crossed the river in various places. One thing worth mentioning is that there is
                    quite a powerful current on the Danube and the little zille we were paddling was
                    not very maneuverable so you couldn't always judge when the current might bring
                    you in on a collision course with one of these ferries. We had to be very, very
                    careful indeed when we happened to come close to one.</p>
                <p>The reason there was little or no traffic, of course, was that the part of the
                    river we were on was mostly under the control of the Soviets from Linz on.
                    Supplies could just not go through the Soviet sector without following very
                    carefully outlined procedures.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I might digress a little bit and say something about the occupation...about our
                    experience during the occupation when we were there. As I say, we got to Vienna
                    through the Soviet zone via train and had to carry “gray cards” which were
                    identification documents. Soviet officials would board the trains from time to
                    time and check on these cards. After arriving in Vienna we were housed in the
                    Bristol Hotel right across the street from the State Opera House and one of the
                    finest hotels in Vienna. We had a small son at that point so the three of us had
                    one large double room and one adjoining single room with two massive bathrooms
                    each with a seven foot bathtub. We had a refrigerator. Our rooms had velvet
                    brocaded wall paper and full room service. For these magnificent accommodations
                    we paid the princely sum of 50 cents per room per day. The Bristol was an
                    American occupying army billet, I suppose. We were there for at least six
                    months.</p>
                <p>After that we moved to a small house out near Grinzing, one of the famous wine
                    villages on the outskirts of Vienna. The house was really too small for us, but
                    we were ready for anything after six months in a hotel. Although the hotel was
                    wonderful in its way. We had full maid service and babysitting service. We had
                    concierges who knew all the casts of the operas, could advise us of the best
                    operas to see, and could procure excellent seats. In those days in Vienna you
                    could get the best opera seat in the house for something like $2.50. If you went
                    to the best restaurant in town you could get the finest meal you could eat for
                    about the same price. So it was really, in a fiscal sense, paradise.</p>
                <p>We enjoyed Vienna very much as a place to live and it was also very interesting
                    culturally. Another thing worth mentioning is that our two youngest children,
                    our second son and our daughter, were both born in Vienna.</p>
                <p>There was an American Club with a swimming pool and tennis courts; there was a
                    PX—the Army took care of its own very well. The High Commission was really part
                    of the military structure so we benefitted from all these perks.</p>
                <p>The other occupying powers administered their section in typical fashion. The
                    American section of Austria took on an air of a pseudo-United States with lots
                    of activity, business and reconstruction. The French concentrated more on the
                    hotels and the food and that sort of thing. The British, well, there was nothing
                    really worth noting about their section. But the Soviet section...you could go
                    into the Soviet section with a blindfold, and when you took it off you would
                    know at once that you were in the Soviet section, because it was drab, gray,
                    buildings had not been repaired, the atmosphere was repressive. Perhaps it was
                    that way because we expected it to be that way, but I think we were perceptive
                    enough to see what was actually happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Another thing about the occupation, the three Western powers, France, Britain and
                    the United States, were trying to build Austria up and bring it back to economic
                    and political viability. We were always trying to persuade the Soviets to
                    negotiate an end to the treaty and loosen up their regulations. This really was
                    the bulk of my work. Eighty percent of my work was with civil aviation. Most of
                    the work was trying to train Austrians to take over their civil air activities
                    after the end of the occupation. The Soviets opposed this all the way because
                    they feared that the Austrian air force would be built up and would lead to the
                    restoration of the Austro-German Luftwaffe. This was the excuse they used to
                    keep a tight clamp on all civil air activities by Austrians.</p>
                <p>There were several airfields in the American zone, both civil and military, which
                    in theory were under my aegis. One of them was in Linz, another in Salzburg,
                    another in Tulln, right outside Vienna. Then there was a little air strip in the
                    American zone of Vienna itself which was right along the Danube Canal. This was
                    really a little death trap. It was a very short and narrow runway right next to
                    the Canal with a dog leg in it, following a bend in the Canal. Only small planes
                    could use it, and these had to bend their flight pattern while taking off or
                    landing. Various city streets led broadside into the landing strip. Wind would
                    whistle through those streets and cause turbulence on the strip. There were a
                    number of crashes; several young Air Force officers who worked with me, met
                    their deaths there during my time in Vienna.</p>
                <p>My activities outside of negotiations on the civil air directorate, were largely
                    associated with trying to keep the Austrians flying. The way we got around
                    Soviet objections was that we set up gliding schools and clubs. If you have a
                    glider you need a small plane to get it in the air. So we had a number of small
                    planes. It followed obviously that if Austrians were allowed to glide, they
                    should be able to fly planes to tow the gliders up. So in this way we trained a
                    steady stream of pilots who we envisaged would become the nucleus for the
                    eventual Austrian airline after the occupation.</p>
                <p>The Soviets knew pretty well what we were doing and they didn't like it but they
                    really didn't have any legal basis for objecting to it. They interposed all
                    sorts of obstacles. For example, they would announce arbitrarily that the air
                    corridors were closed for a certain time. I might interject here that there were
                    air corridors we had to follow when flying in and out of Vienna. One came up
                    from the south which went through the British occupied zone and one that came in
                    from the West went through the U.S. zone and, after Linz, went over Soviet
                    occupied territory. These were very jealously guarded by us. The Soviets were
                    always trying to get us to change these air corridors because at least one of
                    them flew over Soviet military air installations. They assumed that we were
                    taking photographs of these installations whenever we sent planes through the
                    corridor, and I imagine we indeed were. But that was not my function.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Another thing we had to do was develop air traffic control personnel. For each
                    airfield we had to have a control tower and it made sense to have Austrians in
                    those towers. So this was how we trained Austria's air control tower operators.
                    We also had an air rescue group which gave us another excuse for training and
                    keeping Austrians in the air.</p>
                <p>One interesting political matter I should mention is that the Minister of
                    Transport and Nationalized Industries was a chap named Waldbruner, a socialist
                    and Labor Party member. The Civil Aviation branch was under him. The head of
                    that and my main Austrian government contact was Walter Watzek, a very nice,
                    forthright person who had been wounded in the war and had lost his larynx. He
                    breathed through a tube coming out of his throat and spoke with a very husky
                    voice. But he was a fine fellow. He worked under Waldbruner.</p>
                <p>Other people interested in civil aviation were with the other party, the National
                    Volkspartei, Chancellor Rabb's party. Vice Chancellor Sharf was leader of the
                    Labor Party. The National Party people who were involved with aviation were led
                    by Fritz Polcar, a member of the Austrian legislature and a very slippery
                    character indeed. The governmental backing for him came from the Minister of
                    Finance who was under the control of the National Party. This was very
                    significant because while my official dealings were with Watzek, I still had to
                    contend with Fritz Polcar and his followers.</p>
                <p>Fritz Polcar was president of the Austrian Aero Club which was the conservative's
                    group that had to do with civil aviation. He was a real go getter and somewhat
                    of a shyster, I suspect. He eventually ended up, I believe, in prison for some
                    corrupt practice or other. But he was an interesting happy go lucky sort of
                    fellow. He used to have a lot of parties at the local heurigen establishments. I
                    had to go to many of those. There was a great deal of drinking on such occasions
                    and I always tried to leave with my honor intact, which was not always very easy
                    to do.</p>
                <p>Polcar had a number of ex-Austrian pilots with him. One in particular I remember
                    was Sepp Froeschl, a Luftwaffe pilot who had been shot down and severely burned.
                    These people were all anxious to get back into the air. There was a constant
                    struggle between the Transport Minister (Labor) and the Finance Minister
                    (National) and Polcar to maneuver themselves into position to take over the
                    Austrian airline and entire civil aviation activity as well, because as long as
                    Waldbruner was Minister of Transport, the government side of civil aviation
                    would be controlled by the people he was associated with, the socialists.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The eventual turning over of the air fields and installations to the Austrians
                    after the State Treaty was signed, and I will go into the treaty itself later,
                    was a very intricate business. We had to keep in mind at all times that there
                    were two factions, each trying to get complete control over the air fields and
                    the incipient Austrian airline. I spent almost all of my time trying to work out
                    a process whereby we could give over these air fields to both sides so that they
                    could all share equally in the turnover. Once the air facilities were in
                    Austrian hands it was up to them to finally resolve their differences. I felt
                    that we should not take it upon ourselves to hand the air fields over to one
                    faction in exclusion of the other. And I thought that our military were lined up
                    solidly behind this effort. I remember that we were slated to turnover all the
                    installations on the afternoon of a certain date to representatives of both
                    Transport and Finance Ministries. I was to pick up Watzek at an agreed upon
                    place out at Tulln airbase. The turnover was all going to be symbolically done
                    at the main American airbase near Vienna at a predetermined time in the
                    afternoon. The Ministry of Finance was going to send representatives. There was
                    to be a ceremony at which the signing over of air facilities would take place
                    and the Austrian flag raised.</p>
                <p>To my horror, on the morning of the day that this was supposed to take place, I
                    got a phone call from my Air Force colleague who was in charge of operations at
                    Tulln airbase, saying that they had “done it.” I asked, “Done what?” Well, he
                    said, “We turned everything over to the Austrians.” I was astounded and
                    horrified and said, “How could you have done this? We are supposed to do it this
                    afternoon.” He said, “Oh, well, the Ministry of Finance sent some people over
                    this morning and we turned everything over to them.” I said, “My heavens, what
                    are you going to do about the Ministry of Transport and Watzek?” “Oh, well,” he
                    said, “we are going to have the flag raising ceremony this afternoon and he can
                    come to that.”</p>
                <p>Well, of course, I transmitted all this to Watzek and I'm sure he thought he had
                    been betrayed, that I had lied to him or misled him at the very least. It was a
                    highly embarrassing situation. He came to the flag raising and they even started
                    that ceremony off without him. It really was a terribly aggravating thing for me
                    and for the Embassy and for half of the Austrian people we dealt with. At the
                    time I was extremely angry with our Air Force. I felt that I had been betrayed,
                    that they had gone against what we had all been so careful to arrange.</p>
                <p>In retrospect I think probably that this was not just a casual mistake. I think
                    there were a number of rather conservative colonels who were very closely
                    involved in everything that was going on related to turning over facilities to
                    the Austrians. It occurs to me that they were suspicious of Waldbruner and his
                    fellow Labor Party socialists. They were just not going to turn anything over to
                    the socialists. They felt that it was better and more American to turn things
                    over to conservatives. I had no axe to grind for either side. All I wanted to do
                    was to be fair to both, and I felt that our military did themselves and our
                    Embassy a great disservice by engaging in that little bit of unfair play. I
                    certainly reported this to the Embassy, but I doubt it ever found its way into
                    the historical archives. But it shows how despite the best efforts of men things
                    can go awry.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The saga of the struggle between the two parties as to which would take over the
                    Austrian airline continued long after the occupation ended. The result was that
                    Austria ended up with two airlines. One was Air Austria, the one run by the
                    National VolksPartei and the other was Austrian Airways, which was under the
                    Ministry of Transport and Labor and run by a gentleman named Rudolf Trimmel,
                    with whom I kept a Christmas card correspondence until he died several years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>As a postscript to all this, years later, about eight or ten years ago, Anne and
                    I went back to Vienna on a nostalgia trip. I went to the Austrian Airlines
                    office there—by this time there was only one air line—and asked to see a list of
                    the Board of Directors to see if there was anybody I remembered, but there
                    wasn't. Then the young lady who was helping me handed me a book in English on
                    the history of the Austrian Airlines. I speedily rushed through the pages trying
                    to find the era of the mid-50s in which I had spent most of my time worrying and
                    working. I think I found only one sentence that covered the whole period of
                    occupation. Something to the effect that during the occupation Austrian air
                    activity was confined to gliding and after the occupation the Austrian airline
                    came into being. Almost a complete ignoring of what had really taken most of my
                    life during three whole years. So that was another humbling experience.</p>
                <p>The only other thing I want to talk about was the signing of the Austrian State
                    Treaty. As civil air officer, since the problems associated with aviation were
                    fairly important, I was appointed a member of the U.S. negotiating team. I
                    participated in the preparations for the talks (at a very low level).</p>
                <p>I was highly impressed with the negotiating ability of our Ambassador, Tommy
                    Thompson, who incidentally was one of the finest ambassadors I have ever worked
                    with if not the finest. He was one of the best negotiators our government has
                    ever had, although he didn't do much actual bargaining. He was effective without
                    seeming to be so. He knew when to stand firm and how not to say too much. He
                    kept his remarks to a bare minimum.</p>
                <p>But he was on top of everything and he knew that he had the Soviets over a barrel
                    because the Soviets had determined to relinquish control. They had asked
                    Chancellor Rabb to come to Moscow a month or so before the State Treaty
                    negotiations began, and had at that time proposed certain procedures for ending
                    the occupation. The Austrians were so anxious to see the end of the occupation
                    that they agreed to various conditions which Ambassador Thompson was confident
                    they need not have accepted and he was determined that he was not going to let
                    Austria weaken itself in this way.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>For example, the Soviets wanted to keep extraterritorial rights in Austrian oil
                    fields and oil industry after they left the country. Tommy concluded from long
                    experience dealing with the Soviets that they were determined to get out of
                    Austria and would eventually knuckle under and accept any reasonable
                    precondition that we might insist on. If they wanted Austria to be neutral, as
                    they did, they had to live by that themselves, and couldn't retain
                    extraterritorial rights. So he very cleverly and persistently held firm on this
                    point and finally forced the Soviets to withdraw their demand.</p>
                <p>It went right down to the wire as a matter of fact. Secretary Dulles was on his
                    way over to sign the Austrian State Treaty. He was in Europe somewhere (perhaps
                    London or Frankfurt) and Tommy sent one of his officers to Dulles to tell him
                    not to come until he gave the word. Dulles knew what was going on and said
                    publicly he would not arrive for the signing unless this point had been settled.
                    So it was indeed settled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: It was 1955. I arrived in 1953 and left in 1956. The State Treaty was
                    signed in Vienna, I think in May 1955.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the negotiations ended successfully, the date of the signing of the State
                    Treaty was set and the great day arrived. We had sent over a tremendous
                    delegation of people led by Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, and
                    including all sorts of great names like Chip Bohlen, Livingston Merchant, etc.
                    There were at least 50 personages, a large delegation.</p>
                <p>I remember on the signing day we went in a motorcade consisting of 13 cars. I was
                    in the 13th car, so I am glad there were 13. We rode from the Embassy over to
                    Belvedere Palace where the treaty was to be signed. The streets were packed with
                    Austrians. It was intermittently raining and sunny...sometimes you could see a
                    sea of umbrellas and other times you could see smiling faces. People were
                    throwing flowers and cheering. I felt as if I were participating in the
                    liberation of Paris or something like that. It was really one of the most
                    heartwarming experiences of my entire time in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we got to the Belvedere Palace. The signing was to take place in the
                    ballroom on the second floor. The floor of the ballroom was supposed to be weak
                    so the number of people allowed to be in the ballroom was severely limited.
                    There was a long table for the five foreign ministers, including the Austrian
                    Foreign Minister, Figl, and their immediate aides were behind them. The rest of
                    us were supposed to stay in rooms off the ballroom and were allowed to look
                    through the doors. But the minute the big five arrived and took their places at
                    the table, as if by an unheard signal we all streamed in from the antechambers
                    and grouped ourselves around the table. I found myself in the back row within a
                    meter and a half of John Foster Dulles' pen. It was somewhat of a crush.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The signing took place and afterwards the foreign ministers went out on a
                    balcony. There were great crowds in front of the Palace. Dulles, in the words of
                    Chip Bohlen or Livingston Merchant, looked like a debutante after her ball
                    because he was smiling and waving at the crowd. Not at all like the dour, rather
                    crusty old fellow that we were used to. Molotov was a short, stubby character.
                    He didn't smile at all but had his hands clasped together over his head in the
                    classic gesture of a winning prize fighter. Macmillan was the ham actor looking
                    over the crowd, pointing and waiving to people. So it was a great performance by
                    everybody. That night we had a reception and dance in the ballroom at the
                    Sch�nbrunn Palace, which was opened up to everybody for the occasion,
                    reminiscent of the glorious days of the Austrian empire.</p>
                <p>The final thing to say is that the next day the newspapers carried a picture of
                    the long table with the foreign ministers and the people in back of them. This
                    picture, as is often the case with newspaper photos was rather indistinct, but I
                    thought as I looked at it that I saw a familiar hairline peering over the group
                    behind the table of notables and thought it was yours truly. So I immediately
                    ordered a dozen copies of the paper and put in a request to the newspaper for an
                    actual positive print of the picture saying that I would like to get something
                    to frame for my mother and posterity. The only trouble was that when the print
                    finally arrived, the hairline was indeed familiar, but it was not my hairline,
                    but that of a colleague in the Austrian Foreign Office. So much for fame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned once when Tommy Thompson was concerned about
                        what the Soviets demanded, that he knew that the Soviets wanted out. What
                        did you mean? Were the Soviets anxious to bring this occupation to an
                        end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: You must realize that Tommy was in constant communication with his old
                    Soviet-hand buddies, Chip Bohlen and other people. All these things were being
                    discussed and analyzed very thoroughly. The feeling was that the Soviets were
                    anxious to find a solution to the Berlin question, and that they thought by
                    giving in a little bit in Austria where they were not as deeply involved, they
                    could kill several birds with one stone. If they could bring about a neutral
                    Austria, or an Austria that was not in the Western camp, they felt they might be
                    able to lighten the political climate and perhaps induce the occupying powers to
                    be willing to negotiate something of comparable significance in Berlin. Possibly
                    a neutral Germany. It was thus felt that the Soviets thought by bending in
                    Austria they could get something favorable to themselves out of the German
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Now there may have been other things involved. There may have been cost factors,
                    who knows. I think you have to examine the records of that time to find out
                    everything that was involved. But Tommy Thompson could analyze these things and
                    he knew through his contacts with Austrians, what the Soviets had told them in
                    their Moscow meeting with Rabb. So he knew the Soviets had made up their minds
                    to end the occupation. And he knew that since they wanted to get out they
                    probably could be persuaded to give up a number of the conditions they had
                    forced the Austrians to accept...which the Austrians had been willing to accept
                    because of their overwhelming anxiety to end the occupation as quickly as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Throughout all the State Treaty negotiations the Austrians would become very
                    nervous when we stood firm, when we insisted that the Soviets give up
                    extraterritorial rights, for example. They were always afraid that the Soviets
                    would say, “Well, if you won't give us what we want, we won't sign the treaty.”
                    But Thompson was a shrewd judge of Soviet character. He knew he had them over a
                    barrel and that they would eventually knuckle under, and they did.</p>
                <p>Through this whole process he displayed nerves of steel. He was patient,
                    persistent. He must have been a brilliant poker player. He was always in
                    complete control of everything, had his fingers on every aspect of the
                    negotiations. He lost about 17 pounds in the process. It was a great
                    performance. I might add that it was his second winning performance. Prior to
                    this he had negotiated a successful outcome to the Trieste conflict between
                    Italy and Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>I don't think there is too much more to say, unless you can think of something
                    that I should talk about. I might mention one thing of interest. While I was
                    duty officer at the Embassy at one point some people straggled into the
                    Embassy...this was on a weekend as I recall...a young man and his obviously
                    pregnant wife. They declared that they had just been in an air crash. It turned
                    out that their plane had crashed on the Kalenberg, right outside Vienna. It had
                    flown into the side of the hill and broken apart. A number of passengers had
                    gotten out without a scratch, including this young frightened American woman who
                    apparently became quite a heroine in the process. She ripped off her petticoat
                    and helped bind the wounds of one of the men who had been hurt. One of our
                    couriers was on that plane...I think his name was John Irwin, if I am not
                    mistaken. He was severely hurt and got some kind of high military award for
                    valor because he carried the diplomatic pouch or part of the pouch out of the
                    plane with him and wouldn't accept pain killers or treatment until he had
                    delivered the pouch into the hands of somebody qualified to receive it. It was
                    quite a performance on his part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have been telling me about the collegial atmosphere at
                        the Embassy in Vienna. I wonder if you would like to put that on the record
                        as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, I would like to. Posts are different. Vienna, I think, was one of
                    the friendliest posts I have ever been assigned to. A very close spirit of
                    cooperation and friendship developed among all the people who were in my type of
                    work. In other words the officers at the Embassy and their wives. We were all
                    doing work that we thought was important and interesting and, for some reason or
                    other that can't be quantified or described, very warm friendships were made at
                    this post.</p>
                <p>I think we now have more close friends from our Vienna days than from any other
                    post where we have served. I think other people who were assigned to Vienna at
                    that time would corroborate this. It was most unusual. When Dick Davies, who was
                    the head of the political section, left, he said in his final remarks at his
                    farewell party, “You may not realize it, but this is a special post. The
                    friendships that you have made here will last all of your lives.” He went on in
                    that vein for a few minutes and finally broke down in tears and had to stop. So
                    it was an unusual post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, I think we were all working hard. We were up against formidable
                    adversaries. We had fine people in charge...the Ambassador, his deputies and
                    senior and junior officers were all able. It was just an unusual amalgam of
                    things that made for a very interesting and friendly post. The gemutlich
                    atmosphere of Vienna, the music, food, and historic buildings, the charm of the
                    countryside, all contributed to the feeling of well being each of us had.</p>

                <p>Van Oss - Part 2</p>
                <p>Interview of Henrik Van Oss, Foreign Service officer retired. This is being taped
                    on November 14th, 1991, and Mr. Van Oss is talking about his experiences while
                    serving in the Department of State.</p>
                <p>VAN OSS: One of the interesting things about the Biographic Information Division
                    occurred at the time that the State Department Division, and the Biographic
                    Record Section at the OSS were merged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that over where they had the map section also in
                        the old auditorium?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Not quite, no. It was a building on C Street, an old building and it was
                    right across the street from the old Naval Medical buildings which housed a lot
                    of the OSS stuff. The combined biographic section, which I headed as acting
                    chief, was under what became known as the State Department Research and
                    Intelligence section. And that was at that time almost entirely, or at least a
                    good proportion of it, was the OSS Research and Intelligence section, I think
                    that is what it was called. And it was headed by the very well known historian,
                    William Langer and one of his main assistants was Sherman Kent who was a very
                    well known OSS operator, or employee, or officer. These were all on the research
                    and analysis side of it. These were not men who were involved in espionage or
                    counter-espionage and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting because I sat in on all the staff meetings that Langer
                    held to discuss the process of merging the OSS Research and Intelligence section
                    into the Department of State. And all these high ranking, well trained experts
                    like Burton Fras__ in the Far East, and various others I could mention, who
                    faced this prospect of now becoming State Department members were very, very
                    nervous about it. They were very reluctant to go over to go under the State
                    umbrella. They said that they thought they should be part of the policy making
                    process, and that if they weren't they would resign. They were very nervous and
                    upset about the demise of OSS, and they're going under State. But this was
                    edicted, and a man named McCormick who was the head of the whole State
                    Department intelligence set-up, under whom Langer was one of the main deputies.
                    McCormick's place was taken by Bill Eddy, Colonel Eddy, who was a very well
                    known military intelligence, and OSS man in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the political desks in the Department were too clever by far for the much
                    more highly trained, and well educated opposites in OSS, and they refused to
                    give up any of the policy making powers that they had. So the remnants of OSS
                    had to be content with providing the intelligence on which the policy would be
                    based, which was a very responsible thing for them in any event, and it was
                    certainly nothing for them to be upset about. They hadn't had policy making
                    powers in OSS so why should they feel they should be brought into that process
                    more than as the providers of the information on which the policies would be
                    based. Of course, we had in Biographic Intelligence no such pretensions, or
                    hopes. We knew that we were basically a filing organization, a collection
                    organization, and we proceeded on that basis.</p>
                <p>My deputy there, I might mention, was Doug Heck who later became ambassador in
                    Niger, Africa, and then in Nepal, and had a distinguished career in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about Washington in the '42 to '48 period.
                        Were you still living at 1527 I Street at this point? How long did you stay
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, I stayed there for about two or three years. I was the last one
                    there, and that in itself is a long story that belongs in another medium, I
                    think.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Getting back to the Department, and wartime Washington. I can't tell you how
                    accelerating it was to be in Washington at that time. I knew from the first day
                    that I reported that this was where I wanted to be, and where I belonged so to
                    speak. It was, as I say, essentially a sleepy town but the people who were
                    working in it, and the people who were coming into it from the outside, were
                    completely and profoundly involved in the war effort in one way or another. We
                    were convinced in putting out the proclaimed list of bloc nationals, we were
                    doing our bit to make sure that Germany and Japan were not benefitting from
                    trade with firms that were subject to our control. By that I mean these firms,
                    once they were on the list, if any American firm traded or had dealings with a
                    firm on the proclaimed list, that American firm was in danger of being placed on
                    that list itself. Or having some penalties imposed on it. We worked long hours,
                    we were enthusiastic. Everybody was upbeat. We were all staunch supporters of
                    Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and we couldn't imagine what would go on without him.
                    I remember when he died in 1945 that we all wondered how in the world Harry
                    Truman could cope. I remember one colleague saying, “Well, if Harry Truman has
                    any courage or intelligence at all he'll just say, 'I can't do it,' and resign
                    and let somebody take over who can.” Well, obviously that was not a very
                    accurate assessment of Harry Truman's worth.</p>
                <p>The weaknesses in the Department, which I will describe later, did not exist to
                    the same extent at this period. There were clearances that one had to get, of
                    course, and inevitable conferences—interminable conferences of one sort or
                    another. But there was one troubling schism, if you want to call it that, or
                    dichotomy, which is the best word, and that was between the professional side of
                    the State Department, and the administrative side of the State Department, and I
                    had a slight taste of the administrative side because I was asked to become the
                    administrative officer of World Trade Intelligence for about a six month period.
                    It didn't take me more than about one month to realize that I was in something
                    that I didn't want to be in. Because in administration one was immediately put
                    into contact with all sorts of personnel problems of one sort or another. One
                    that I can remember was a secretary who was working in the Secretary of State's
                    office was kidnaped by her boyfriend, and taken off someplace, and eventually
                    found and brought back. The poor thing was fine, nothing which we would call
                    mementos today happened to her. But in those days it was a great scandal, and
                    she was taken out of the Secretary's office, and brought into our office and she
                    became my secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More or less in disgrace you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, and I was asked whether I minded. I was delighted, she was awfully
                    good. But apart from that there were other former employees who had grievances,
                    they felt that they hadn't been promoted, or that their efficiency rating
                    reports hadn't been what they should have been. And then we had to go to
                    hearings on this sort of thing. And then there were interminable job
                    descriptions, reports that you had to make. And worst of all, you dealt with
                    long-standing low-ranking civil servants who didn't have this gung-ho approach.
                    They couldn't have cared less whether there was a war on or not. They obeyed the
                    rules, and they filled out...</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like dealing with the post office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, sort of, relatively speaking. Mind you, they had some good people
                    too. Bob Ryan, who later became ambassador to Niger, was a very good
                    administrative officer, and personnel officer, but he was the exception rather
                    than the rule. Not only that, I still had my P-1, or P-2 by this time rating,
                    and I was anxious to get back into professional status. And as a GS the rate of
                    promotion was very much slower, and it depended on criteria that had nothing to
                    do with what little skills I had at that time. My educational background was in
                    political science, and my interests were in that, and not in management and
                    economics—or rather, administration. So, fortunately, I was able to get back
                    into the professional work, and if I remember correctly and I may be wrong on
                    this, I think it was the setting up of the Biographic Information Section of
                    World Trade Intelligence that gave me the means of doing that.</p>
                <p>The professional side of the Department was fun, it had to do with foreign
                    policy, and world events. And the administrative side was civil service, job
                    descriptions, dullsville, if I may say so. To me anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, there were these different grades. There was
                        the P-grade for professionals, and a GS grade for everybody else. And in the
                        Foreign Service itself, which you weren't yet in actually, administrative
                        personnel did not have officer rank. Isn't that true at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That's right. They were called FSSs, Foreign Service Staff personnel.
                    And the officers were called FSOs, Foreign Service Officers. Again, some of my
                    colleagues have done very well in administration. One in particular was Findley
                    Burns, who really made his mark in administration and eventually became
                    ambassador to Ecuador, and Jordan. And he was administrative counselor in
                    London, I think with ministerial rank. So he did awfully good, but he was good,
                    and imaginative, and he operated on a high scale. He was not to be compared with
                    these relative drudges who had spent their lifetime... these elderly men and
                    ladies who had been doing the same thing for years and years and years. So that
                    was the one weakness, if you want to call it that, of the Department at the
                    time. Outside of that that whole period was a fascinating one, and I don't
                    regret any of it. Even the slight exposure to administrative work. That was an
                    eye opener for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, as you said, you took the exam in '45, you were sworn
                        in in '46, but you actually didn't take an FSO job for two years after
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: For two years. I was finally appointed in roughly May '48 to Shanghai.
                    In the meantime, the preceding November, 1947, I had been married to my present
                    spouse, and we went to Shanghai, our first post together. And I think that's one
                    of the luckiest things that ever happened to me for many reasons, particularly
                    seeing how difficult it is for a young bachelor to find a suitable person to
                    marry when he is abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today it's more difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Even more difficult today, my goodness. It was difficult then. In those
                    days there were one or two female Foreign Service officers. Frances Willis, I
                    think, was the one I remember most. She was a high ranking FSO, and there were
                    one or two others. I think there was one named Hughes. But really the first one
                    of my generation was Ann Littleton, who passed the exams about the same time
                    that I did, and was assigned to Canada. And, as I understand it, was taken over
                    by the ambassador's wife and sort of treated like a debutante daughter, and
                    really resented greatly not being allowed to do her work like any other
                    officer—being treated with kid gloves. She eventually, I believe, resigned. And,
                    of course, today that's completely changed.</p>
                <p>In 1948, I and my new bride, Anne Burnett of Louisville, Kentucky, went to our
                    first post in Shanghai. And then in 1950 I described that on a previous tape—in
                    1950 we went to Kuala Lumpur which I have also described. And in 1953 we went to
                    Vienna, which I will describe later, except to say that in Vienna I was doing,
                    among other things, civil aviation work. And that, for better or worse, brought
                    me to the attention of the Civil Aviation Division of the Department, and I was
                    assigned to the Department from Vienna to the Aviation Division in the Office of
                    Transport and Communications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: In 1957. This is the second stage that I mentioned in the beginning of
                    this tape. I served with this division for two years, '57 to '59, two and a half
                    years, and then went from there I volunteered for special African area studies,
                    and went into SAIS, School of Advanced International Studies, at Johns Hopkins
                    for training in African area studies.</p>
                <p>My time in the Department with Civil Aviation was an eye opener to me. I went
                    there under some protest—not under protest, but somewhat reluctantly because I
                    had hoped to get back into political work. I had been doing economic work in
                    Vienna although there was a very strong political cast to what I was doing as
                    will be revealed later. But I had hoped to get into either another post abroad,
                    or into political work in the Department. I hoped really to get abroad because I
                    had three youngsters, the oldest one four, and the youngest two still in
                    diapers. So for Anne's sake I wanted to have the benefit of the easier living
                    abroad where you could get help, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>But it was not to be, and I found myself in the Aviation Division. Now, at this
                    point I was in a division that worked very closely with airlines, very closely
                    with the Civil Aeronautic Board, very closely with the civil air administration,
                    CAA which later became the FAA, very closely with IATA, I think that's
                    International Air Transport Association. In other words, we were exposed to
                    lobbyist and pressures from the American private sector which I had never been
                    really exposed to before.</p>
                <p>My job at Civil Aviation Division was ostensibly that of head of Air Transport
                    Relations branch of the Aviation division. And my job ostensibly was to help
                    negotiate bilateral air transport agreements with other countries. And I had
                    four or five officers under me, so to speak. And I had taken the place of a
                    woman named Bert Koquaiser who was a formidable, very highly-trained civil
                    aviation expert who had been doing this work for heaven knows how long, 20 years
                    possibly, or 15 years anyway, and who had a steel trap mind. She was a lawyer
                    trained in air law, international relations, etc., and veteran negotiator, with
                    her own ideas of how to do things. She was still in the division as a deputy
                    chief, I think. So here I was, knowing practically nothing about this side of
                    civil aviation.</p>
                <p>I found my underlings, so-called, were far more qualified to deal with these
                    matters than I. Jim Ferretti and John—oh, I can't remember some of the other
                    names—but Jim Ferretti in particular was a brilliant civil aviation specialist
                    who knew far more than I would ever know about this subject. I felt to be able
                    to handle this subject properly I should take a year off to study, and perhaps
                    get a degree, and really know what I was talking about. But, nonetheless,
                    clinched my fist and plunged into it. And what an eye opener it was. I've said
                    that before, but if you can imagine going into a bilateral negotiation with,
                    let's say, Holland, and Holland is trying to...well, let me go back. I have to
                    go back a little bit.</p>
                <p>The essence of our problem was Pan American Airways. Pan American had been
                    practically the only airline that we had after the war. The only airline flying
                    international routes. So we had been able to get very advantageous bilateral air
                    agreements with practically every country that mattered. And Pan American was
                    determined to hang on to these advantages come hell or high water, and stopped
                    at nothing really to prevent the Department, and the CAB, and anybody else from
                    frittering away these rights that they had.</p>
                <p>And then the other interesting thing is, that the CAB, as I recall, a five-headed
                    monster. There were five civil aeronautics board members, each one equally as
                    important as the other. So that by getting the approval on one, you could not
                    depend on getting the approval of the other four. I think there were five, maybe
                    there were only three as I think on it. But anyway, let's say five, history will
                    forgive me if it was three.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>So you go into a bilateral negotiation with let's say Holland. Holland wants to
                    fly into, let's say, Houston. And what we want in return is beyond rights in
                    Amsterdam so that PanAm can fly into Amsterdam, and carry passengers to any
                    other country in the world beyond Amsterdam. Well, of course, Holland doesn't
                    want to give up those rights because KLM flies those rights, and they don't want
                    competition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: KLM was then a fairly new organization compared to
                        PanAm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I don't know how new it was, but it certainly was not up to PanAm
                    after the war because Holland was devastated by the war, and it took them a
                    number of years to get on their feet. But PanAm really was the pioneer in a lot
                    of this, or almost a pioneer, and it was sitting in the cat bird seat. It had
                    very powerful lobbyist in Washington, and they didn't hesitate to chop off the
                    heads of any State Department people who opposed them. They had them
                    transferred, or fired, or whatever was necessary to get their way.</p>
                <p>So, getting back to Holland, here you have the Dutch mission negotiating team
                    headed by their Minister of Transport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because KLM was a government agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, no, no. KLM had a representative there to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it was owned by the Dutch government, it wasn't a
                        private airline.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I'm not sure about that. I think it could well have been at least partly
                    private. Anyway, this is unimportant, at least not to the point that I'm trying
                    to make.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>So, you sit there. You come in, you've had meetings with the CAB, with PanAm,
                    with IATA, with every conceivable person in the United States interested in
                    this. And you try to reach a U.S. position that you can support in this
                    negotiation with Holland. And you come into this first meeting, and you haven't
                    reached a position. So with the whole Dutch group sitting opposite the table
                    from you, you say...I don't say, I was one of the aiders and abetters, but we
                    had a Deputy Assistant Secretary Kalijarvi, or somebody like that...not
                    Kalahari, well, I don't remember his name, it was a Finnish name. He was the
                    chief negotiator. You have him saying, “Gentlemen, welcome to Washington. We
                    hope to be able to start this negotiation fairly soon, but unfortunately we have
                    to postpone it for a little bit.” So then we smile, and shake hands, and leave.
                    Then we stay up all night debating with PanAm, and CAB, trying to reach some
                    sort of an agreement because we in the State Department, want to help Holland,
                    and we want to be able to bargain, and say, “All right, we'll give you Houston
                    if you'll give us beyond rights to country X and Y.” But PanAm doesn't want to
                    give up Houston. They don't want KLM coming into Houston, so they won't agree.
                    And if they don't agree, the CAB won't agree because they're worried about the
                    pressures that PanAm will put on them through Congress. And Congressmen are
                    calling.</p>
                <p>So we go into the next session the next day, and we say, “Welcome again. Have a
                    cup of coffee. Unfortunately we haven't yet...there are certain things that we
                    have to talk over.” Well, this happened, as I recall, for four or five days. So
                    we finally hammered out something that we would give them Houston in return for
                    this and that and the other thing. And finally had the negotiation, a day or two
                    of it, and came to a rather satisfactory compromise. And that was it. But the
                    embarrassment of going in day after day, having invited them over at a certain
                    time on the assumption that we were all ready to roll, and then not be able to
                    even bargain, even put forth a position, is really excruciating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there someone from L on that negotiating team as
                        well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I don't recall that he was actually on the negotiating team. I think
                    that the Bureau of Transport and Communications had an L person assigned to it
                    who may have been involved. I don't remember who was on that particular
                    negotiation. But there were some very good men on it. I think at least one or
                    two members of the CAB were on the negotiating team, Kalijarvi, I guess was the
                    name of the Deputy Assistant Secretary who was the head of it. And Joe Watson
                    was the perpetual very, very well informed staff assistant to the CAB, who
                    really did all their work for them. Anyway, that's not important.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The important thing is that you realize that negotiation isn't always a matter of
                    compromise, or even of argumentation, nor of putting forth a position. It's a
                    matter of trying to hammer out something that's acceptable to everybody in your
                    own country that enables you to start talking with a foreign country. And this
                    procedure was duplicated on several other negotiations that I was involved in.
                    So that was an eye opener to me. I certainly went into the Foreign Service with
                    the knowledge that I would have to support my government against foreign
                    interests, and I was perfectly willing to do that, but I had never realized that
                    I would have to fight against my own country in a sense. Fight against
                    businessmen, and lobbyist, and Congressmen, and that sort of thing—not fight
                    against them, but at least find them opposing everything, struggle with them.
                    Find them opposing everything we were trying to do. And, of course, I can see
                    their point, their interest. PanAm's interest was heavily involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But PanAm didn't see the world picture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, PanAm didn't care about the world picture. PanAm cared about
                    retaining its privileges and its routes, and not getting too much competition,
                    and getting its profits, and so on. And that's the function of a company. I'm
                    not blackening their name. I think any company does that that has an
                    interest...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has served it right, hasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes, look at PanAm today as the result of competition.</p>
                <p>One interesting thing that happened to me in the Aviation Division occurred, I
                    think, in 1958. By way of preliminary, before I go into it.</p>
                <p>I found after a bit that, I hate to admit it because I was over my head as the
                    so-called the chief of Air Transport Relations, over my head in the sense that I
                    didn't feel that I should be supervising people who knew more than I did. So I
                    suggested to Henry Snowden, who was the chief of the Aviation Division, that we
                    divide the work up differently. That instead of acting as a pyramid with these
                    four men reporting through me, that we give each person an area to cover, and
                    that he be in charge of that area, and go right up to the chief of the division,
                    Henry Snowden, without this extra layer that I imposed. Because I couldn't
                    really improve too much on what he had come up with. Maybe I could improve their
                    grammar, or their writing style, or something like that. But certainly the
                    substance they were more than able than I to determine what it should be. So we
                    did that, and I took for my section the relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>And as part of that I had a great amount of fun because, I think it was in '58,
                    that Khrushchev made a trip to the United States. Now, don't hold me on the
                    time, but it was I think '58, and there were two trips to the United States. One
                    by the Russian Ambassador Smynoff and the other by Khrushchev. But the
                    Khrushchev one is the most important one because this involved what in essence
                    became a negotiation with the Soviets. And I was working closely with Paul
                    Smith, and Ed Fiers, and a fellow named Isham on the Soviet desk. But I was also
                    working with the FBI, and with the immigration officials, and customs, and
                    everybody else involved because Khrushchev wanted to fly over on his plane. And
                    in those days the Soviets were way ahead of us in jet passenger aircraft. They
                    had great big planes. I can't remember the name, Tuperoff, I think it was, I
                    can't remember the designation. But they were huge planes, four-engine jet jobs,
                    and they wanted to bring this plane into Idlewild which they thought was the
                    most prestigious American airfield. This was in the days before such planes
                    could get into National Air Field in Washington.</p>
                <p>So, the problem was that the New York Port Authorities, or the people who ran
                    Idlewild, were bound by noise regulations which the people living around
                    Idlewild had forced the legislators to impose upon them. And the Soviets could
                    never really get it into heads that we in the State Department couldn't simply
                    order Idlewild to ignore these noise regulations. And I can remember
                    interminable debates with the Soviet people. I remember a Lt. Colonel Layzoff,
                    and as I recall another young officer named Eganoff, and one or two others who
                    would come over and I just couldn't convince them that the State Department, and
                    the President, nobody had the authority to order the New York Authority to order
                    Idlewild to ignore these noise regulations.</p>
                <p>Finally I found out that the only jet craft that had passed the noise regulations
                    was the French caravel. They had voluntarily submitted to a test, a very
                    thorough noise testing, and a report had been prepared on this noise testing.
                    And I knew that this report was unclassified, so I exercised what little cunning
                    I had, and I got a copy of this report and I invited the two Soviet negotiators
                    to come to my office, and I invited somebody from the Soviet desk to come. I
                    again said that we couldn't possibly...there was no way under the law that we
                    could force Idlewild to do anything it didn't want to do. Mind you, I suppose if
                    we had really made a strong pitch to Idlewild, we might have been able to
                    persuade them to allow this plane in. But we didn't feel that was the thing to
                    do. We wanted the plane to come into Andrews Air Force base for many reasons,
                    including where they would be over flying, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>So I said to these Russians, “If you would agree to submit to a noise test, like
                    the one that the Caravel took, if you passed that test, then I'm sure that
                    Idlewild would let you in.” And, of course, they said they wouldn't dream of
                    doing that. And I could see that they didn't believe me when I talked about the
                    Caravel, so I finally took out from under my blotter on the desk, I took this
                    report out and I said, “Here's the report that proves that Caravel passed this
                    noise test.” And the Soviets looked at that with mouth watering, and I said,
                    “Would you like to have it?” And the Soviet desk officer almost fell through the
                    floor at that because he was so used to hanging onto everything. I said, “Here,”
                    and I gave it to them. And the Soviet clutched it eagerly, and put it in his
                    coat pocket. And that did the trick. They accepted finally that they would have
                    to go through a rather cumbersome process if they were to get into Idlewild. And
                    eventually the plane came into Andrews Air Force base. And I had to assure my
                    Soviet desk colleague that this was unclassified, and was not in violation of
                    the U.S. security regulations.</p>
                <p>But the amount of work involved in just getting this one plane in was monumental.
                    We had to go through many meetings with FBI, and control tower personnel, and
                    figure out where American officers could board the plane, in Gander I think it
                    was, and it really was quite an interesting operation. A lot of work for
                    something that wasn't really all that significant, but I found that one of the
                    more interesting things that happened to me in Civil Aviation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you actually in the aviation division in the
                        State Department assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: It was about two years. And it was one of the periods when promotions
                    were coming slowly, and I was still a Class 4 officer. And I thought I would
                    make a virtue out of necessity, or a virtue out of...I can't think of the word.
                    Anyway, a virtue out of necessity, by volunteering for the African Area Studies.
                    And I was accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You interested in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I was. I was interested in other things too but Africa was
                    beginning to open up, and I thought this was a particularly interesting time to
                    become involved in an area that was emerging to independence. So I was accepted,
                    and I was sent for a full school year training at the School of Advanced
                    International Studies at Johns Hopkins in Washington. And that's where I spent
                    another year, and then following that was sent to Uganda which I think I've
                    already described. And following that Brazzaville. And after Brazzaville I was
                    assigned to the Department for the third period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: This was in 1964, and this period went from '64 to '67 when I was
                    selected to attend the Senior Seminar in foreign policy which was the most
                    senior training that a State Department official could do in the Foreign Service
                    Institute. That was a great experience.</p>
                <p>But in the Department I was assigned to the job of Deputy Director of the West
                    African Affairs in the African Bureau, which was then headed up by Soapy Mennen
                    Williams, and my boss as chief of AF/W was Bill Trimble who had been ambassador
                    in Cambodia, a very senior Foreign Service officer, an old Princeton man. And
                    Bill was the first substitute Deputy Assistant Secretary. In other words,
                    whenever one of the regular deputy assistant secretaries was out of town, Bill
                    would be seconded to the assistant secretary's office to carry out those
                    functions. And when he did that I became Acting Director of West African
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>And in those days we had some 18 West African countries, all of them, there's no
                    need to innumerate them, but all of them south of Mauritania, and the
                    sub-Saharan portion of Africa. They included, as I recall, down to the Republic
                    of Congo, and Zaire, which was then still called the Congo.</p>
                <p>That was a most interesting period, and a very, very busy period because, as you
                    know, these countries were emerging into independence very rapidly from Ghana in
                    '57 on. All of them were independent by the time my assignment was over. And not
                    only was that an interesting period, but the first years of independence were
                    very interesting and there were numerous coup d'etat in our areas. And I can
                    remember numerous occasions being...by numerous I suppose I mean at least a half
                    dozen, or up to ten, being awakened at the wee hours of the morning and told to
                    get myself over to the Department into the operations room, and attend to
                    Nigerian coup, or Guinean coup, or something of that sort. Or some crisis or
                    other. So it was an extremely vivid, and interesting period.</p>
                <p>But working in the Department had its drawbacks, as I've mentioned before. There
                    were innumerable clearances that one had to go through. One had to work very
                    closely with the AID division, the African portion of the AID agency—the Agency
                    for International Development. And it was a constant fight with that agency to
                    get help. To get money for the African countries. We not only had to get the
                    money voted by Congress, but once it was voted we had to get AID approval for
                    everything that we tried to do. I guess AID would have put it the other way
                    around, that they had to get our approval for everything they tried to do. But
                    we were usually the ones poking and prodding, and trying to get AID to send
                    assistance. And AID was usually the one that was dragging its feet. And for good
                    reason because AID was under close scrutiny by Congress, and Congress imposed
                    all sorts of restrictions, and regulations, and limitations, which AID had to
                    follow.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>So if you had an AID project, it would take a long period for that project to
                    become a fact. For example: we had a project, a bridge across the Niger River in
                    Niger, which would connect, if I recall, Niger with Nigeria, if I remember
                    correctly. This bridge was the largest project for Niger, and it required a
                    feasibility study by AID and that took at least a year. Then they found that the
                    original feasibility study was no longer applicable because the action of the
                    flowing beneath the Niger River had undermined the foundations of where the
                    bridge was supposed to be. So the whole thing had to be revised, and so this
                    project never did get...</p>
                <p>—end Tape 1, Side A.—Start Tape 1, Side B.</p>
                <p>...and this is typical of all large projects. They all required feasibility
                    studies, they all required large numbers of personnel, AID personnel being sent
                    over to administer whatever the project was. It all took a great amount of time,
                    and in my opinion, a great deal too much of the money allocated by Congress was
                    spent in just the administration of the project, rather than in the substance of
                    the project.</p>
                <p>We found that the most valuable, and useful, form of aid during our time was what
                    we called the ambassador's self-help fund. This was a fund that was allotted by
                    AID to the ambassador and his AID assistant, in relatively small quantities. I
                    think something like $20,000 a year, up to say $200,000 a year. And these could
                    be spent virtually without reference to the Department on self-help projects
                    like digging wells, or erecting a school house, or providing toilets. Anything
                    that was manageable within a small village, without all this fodderall of
                    feasibility studies, and prior clearance with the Department. We had to keep the
                    Department informed, of course. But we got a lot more mileage out of those
                    little projects, much more credit for them than we ever got for these big
                    projects because by the time the big projects were finished sometimes they had
                    been so long coming that the receiving government was cynical, and no longer
                    appreciative, and sort of upset that it had taken so long.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had many, many conferences. At this time also...this was in the time
                    of Johnson, and we had, as I recall, National Security meetings at a much lower
                    level than the National Security Council, of course, but meetings of the various
                    agencies involved in any particular country to discuss these AID projects, or
                    any other projects. And as I recall, many, many meetings, meetings, meetings. As
                    I remember my period in Washington at this time, it was a period of constant
                    activity. I had at that time 18 countries that I was more or less responsible
                    for, and each country had a National Day that it had a reception to. So you were
                    kept quite busy going to those National Days, also the countries I had served in
                    before, had National Days to which I was invited. So your nights were not your
                    own, nor were your days your own. You were constantly on the go, and it was
                    really a rat race in every sense of the word.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Apart from the work I did as Deputy Director of AF/W, or acting director as I was
                    most of the time actually, I had a lot of other things that I had to do. I was
                    asked to go on several lecture trips for the Department as part of the
                    Department's public relations with America. I remember going on a series of
                    lectures in the associated mid-Florida colleges—Florida Presbyterian, Florida
                    Southern, and Rollins, talking about African affairs. I also went out to
                    Overland to brief the Peace Corps....the Peace Corps was engaged in fish
                    farming, studying how to do fish farming for Africa. But I was to brief them on
                    the countries that they were going to be going to. I went out to the University
                    of Dubuque in Iowa to talk on African affairs.</p>
                <p>And also, I was asked to attend a number of Foreign Service Institute courses
                    such as one on stresses and strains in modern American society which was a
                    course on urban development really at Penn State. And there was one on communist
                    strategy I remember that I was asked to go to. And there was one on science, the
                    scientific work of the government. These were all a couple of days here and
                    there throughout the two years. So this was all on top of everything else I was
                    doing, but it was a different sort of thing to do, and it was relaxing, although
                    fatiguing, but relaxing in the sense that it kept me up with other items outside
                    of Africa.</p>
                <p>Also, I was asked to be chairman of the Foreign Service Club Committee which was
                    a small committee trying to find a club for the Foreign Service. And eventually,
                    long after I had left it, they did find a club which now exists across Virginia
                    Avenue, I believe. One of the places we looked at, at that time, was what is now
                    DACOR House, the DACOR Bacon House, while it was still Mrs. Bacon's residence.
                    So there was a lot doing, and it was a very gratifying period.</p>
                <p>There was a change while I was working in the Department. The areas were
                    relocated. Nigeria was taken out of West African Affairs and became its own
                    division really, as I recall, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and possibly Ghana as
                    well. This was at a time when they started the Country Director process in the
                    Department, where they had smaller units, and they upped the status of the
                    Country Director, and the Country Director was really supposed to be the top man
                    for the countries he handled right under the Assistant Secretary instead of
                    going through an Office Director. So I became the Country Director for what they
                    called Central West African countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: At that time it was Joe Palmer. The first Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs was Joe Satterthwaite, and Soapy Williams took his place in
                    1960. He was appointed by President Kennedy who told him that it was the most
                    important job that he would assign anybody. And I must say that working with
                    Soapy Williams was really a delight because he was a very strong man. He had his
                    weaknesses, and his insensitivities, but he also had tremendous energy, and the
                    African Bureau was never more in the limelight than it was under Soapy Williams.
                    And we were never in higher repute in Africa than we were under Soapy
                    Williams.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came to your African post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: He came to Uganda, that's right. And he came to Brazzaville. I've
                    forgotten what I said about that, but he was indefatigable, and he insisted on
                    speaking French even though his French was atrocious, but he spoke with courage
                    and determination. And he fought for the African Bureau. He fought with AID to
                    get money, and he fought with Congress. He fought with anybody that he had to to
                    stand up for what he believed in. So I give him high marks because that was the
                    peak of our effectiveness of our nation in Africa. And we were never in higher
                    repute than we were at that time.</p>
                <p>Joe Palmer, who took his place, was a different type. Joe Palmer had been really
                    the first Foreign Service officer to work on African affairs, long before there
                    was an African Bureau. He and people like Bill Witman, and Joe Satterthwaite
                    probably, and one or two others. So there was never a better qualified person to
                    have that post. Soapy Williams couldn't hold a candle to him in knowledge, and
                    knowing what was going on in Africa. But Joe was a typical Foreign Service
                    officer. He was very cautious, low key, he didn't believe in fighting. He
                    believed in trying to get his way by reason, and soft spokenness. And as a
                    result he wasn't as effective in furthering the bureau's position, and a lot of
                    the aid that we were successful in getting under Soapy Williams was held in
                    abeyance during Joe Palmer's time. He was very nice to work with, a fine fellow,
                    but I must say that he was not as effective a leader, or as effective a
                    proponent of American interests as probably Soapy Williams.</p>
                <p>As I've indicated, I spent the two years in the Department—or three years, I
                    guess—and then moved on to the Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>In summarizing my Departmental experience, I can say that these three periods:
                    the first period was one of anticipation of hard work, of buoyancy, wartime
                    experience, and the immediate aftermath of the war, of being in on the ground
                    floor in several intelligence type operations which the Department was carrying
                    on. I was not assigned to OSS, or to CIA at any time although many people
                    assumed that I was because the Biographic Information Division, which I headed,
                    was eventually taken over by CIA, and was moved over there lock, stock and
                    barrel. It became a computerized operation.</p>
                <p>The second period was one of frustration, of being frustrated not only in what I
                    was trying to do in the Department, but in the fact that you had to worry about
                    justifying every act you took with the private sector and Congress. It was a
                    much more integral part of life in America than the other two periods.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>And the third period in the Department was really one of being happily engaged in
                    the things I was the most interested in, African Affairs at that point, engaged
                    in trying to make policy, and respond to events that were taking place with
                    machine-gun like rapidity Africa.</p>
                <p>And the one change that I could see in the Department was from a small,
                    relatively manageable organization in the forties, to a hide-bound bureaucracy
                    in the fifties. And then emerging into a fairly smooth running, but still
                    bureaucratic, large organization which had moved into the former Defense
                    Department in its present headquarters, with the nice rooms on the eighth floor
                    for entertaining foreign officials, and so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>One thing I might mention too that is perhaps worth mentioning. One problem in
                    our dealings with African countries is that one of the great treats for an
                    African head of state, or Foreign Minister, is to be given a trip to the United
                    States. If a head of state comes, its a very difficult proposition because you
                    have to line up the President, and he expects to see the President. So given the
                    fact that there are numerous states all over the world, and numerous heads of
                    state who want to come. There were perhaps two or three African heads of state
                    who were to come every year, and that was about all we could handle.</p>
                <p>Foreign Ministers were another thing. There were dozens and dozens of Foreign
                    Ministers, and each Foreign Minister of one of the countries that I was
                    handling, would come to the United States fully anticipating meeting his
                    opposite number, namely the Secretary of State. And the Secretary of State is
                    faced with Foreign Ministers from practically every country in the world at one
                    point or another. So its very difficult. There's well over 200 at least. Some of
                    them leave office and then their successors come, etc. So it was very difficult
                    to line up the Secretary. Rusk was very good about it, and I suppose I've been
                    into his office two dozen times in the three years that I was involved in this
                    sort of thing. But when he couldn't do it, it was Soapy Williams, or Joe Palmer
                    was always available, but this was an Assistant Secretary of State meeting the
                    Foreign Minister. He's the most important officer that Foreign Minister had to
                    see because he was the one that determined what would happen to that country.
                    But the Foreign Minister wanted to see his colleague, and if he couldn't see the
                    Secretary of State, he wanted to see somebody of equal, or almost equal status.
                    I think I got in to see Under Secretary Ball once. And I got in to see Joe Sisco
                    once.</p>
                <p>And then old Averell Harriman was the one that we could always count on. He was
                    the grand old man of American foreign policy. He had been in high echelons
                    longer than any other man. He had pictures on his wall of everybody from
                    Franklin Delano Roosevelt down to the present time. Every leader, every leader
                    abroad, etc. And he was very good about it. He grumbled, and he would say, “Oh,
                    Hank, I don't want to see him. I've got to worry about Vietnam.” And then I'd
                    say, “I know, but you've been so good about it, and darn it you're the only one
                    of sufficient stature that we can find, and this fellow is going to be upset if
                    he doesn't see somebody like you.” So he'd say, “All right, bring him in.” And I
                    would.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>That was something that was very difficult to arrange, strangely enough. Well,
                    not strange. All of our high officers have a lot of things to do. But to the
                    Foreign Minister of Togo, he wanted to see his colleague, or the acting
                    colleague, and anything far short of that was not acceptable. And that's one of
                    the problems that still exist, I would think.</p>
                <p>Continuation of interview: October 3, November 14, 1991</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an oral interview with Hendrik Van Oss. It is
                        October 3, 1991. Mr. Van Oss will be speaking to us today about his tour as
                        DCM in Brazzaville which began in September, 1962. Mr. Van Oss.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: As you may recall from previous tapes, I left Uganda in mid-September,
                    1962, flew across the continent and arrived eventually in Brazzaville on the
                    26th of September. The contrast between East and West Africa is something that I
                    think I might talk a little bit about.</p>
                <p>East Africa was always one of my favorites. I enjoyed it immensely, it was a
                    beautiful part of the world...green, relatively salubrious climate, not too hot,
                    especially not in Kampala, mountains, lovely scenery, etc. Plus the very
                    important fact that everybody spoke English out there.</p>
                <p>Brazzaville was in what used to be the middle Congo, or part of the French
                    Equatorial African empire, if you want to call it that, where they all speak
                    French. My French was very, very rusty. I hadn't spoken it since Saigon (1950).
                    While I could read it quite easily, I found it difficult to express myself
                    fluently and the sound barrier was very difficult to overcome.</p>
                <p>Also the contrast in the general climate was marked. In West Africa the climate
                    is very hot and humid. Most of the land is flat with brownish hills in the far
                    distance but not nearly as striking as the landscape in East Africa. So West
                    Africa from that standpoint in my mind couldn't hold a candle to the East.</p>
                <p>From the standpoint of politics, however, I think the West could hold its own and
                    probably was every bit as interesting, if not more so, than East Africa. In
                    Congo/Brazzaville, the leader in 1962 was a semi-defrocked priest named Abbe
                    Fulbert Youlou, who had been eased out of the priesthood by reason of excessive
                    drinking and probably also a bit of womanizing. In any event he had become the
                    leader of one of the main parties in that part of the world and after the French
                    granted the countries of Equatorial Africa their independence he eventually
                    consolidated his power and defeated his nearest rivals. He was firmly in control
                    of the Congo when I arrived there.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>My ambassador was Wendell Blancke and I must say a few words about him because he
                    was one of the great characters of the Foreign Service. He was a rather short,
                    portly man who looked very much like Robert Benchley...a little mustache and a
                    jovial twinkle in his eye. He was well educated and very bright. He had been a
                    commercial artist so his interests ran into art, music, poetry. He was, of
                    course, also interested in politics. He was a good administrator and great for
                    the morale of the post. In fact I have never served under an ambassador who had
                    more concern over the well-being and general happiness of his staff. He was very
                    amusing, had a good sense of humor, was a great punster and cartoonist. At
                    conferences, he never paid much attention to the substance of what was going on,
                    but he paid a great deal of attention to the actual words uttered and whenever a
                    word roused a thought in his mind, he would draw a quick cartoon. Some of his
                    drawings were published in the Foreign Affairs Journal. He was noted throughout
                    the Service for his wit.</p>
                <p>He also was an accomplished doggerel poet and one of his most famous poems was
                    the “Ballad of the Butt”, an epic on the role of the cigarette in Germany right
                    after World War II. I have a copy of that. When one of the staff would leave
                    post, Wendell always composed a long poem making nice gentle fun of him;
                    something the person could take with him or her as a memento. So I had great
                    affection for him and enjoyed working under him.</p>
                <p>As an ambassador he was effective in many unusual ways. He translated “Le
                    Congolese”, the national anthem of the Congo into English, wrote it out on
                    parchment of some sort and presented it to the Congolese government. He carried
                    a replica of the U.S. Seal on a wooden plaque and hung it in the Embassy. Those
                    were the sorts of thing he liked to do.</p>
                <p>He was, however, and this was perhaps his one weak point, very nervous. When he
                    would stand around he was always shuffling his feet and in constant motion. When
                    he had to go over to the Congolese Foreign Office he would almost have a crisis
                    of nerves anticipating the visit, worrying about how he would express himself
                    exactly and what he would say. Such concern was unnecessary because he was
                    perfectly fluent in French and certainly knew how to express himself well.
                    Although he was not all that articulate, he was a very good draftsman.</p>
                <p>He had been Consul General in Frankfurt and his background was mostly in German
                    areas, although he had also served in Hanoi at the time I was in Saigon in 1950.
                    So I had known him a long time. He was a old friend. He did his best to make up
                    to me for the fact that I had left my beloved Uganda and had arrived in this
                    “unknown” territory.</p>
                <p>I think my period in Congo/Brazzaville can be divided into two parts. The first
                    part was the first eight months or so between the time we arrived in late
                    September and the time we left to go on home leave. Then there was a coup d'etat
                    and I came back from home leave to find a new government in place. The second
                    part is what happened to us after that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>In the Abbe Fulbert Youlou period, frankly, I didn't have enough to do. I wasn't
                    bored exactly, but I certainly was not working my head off the way I had in
                    Kampala. I was busy trying to learn French. I had a series of French teachers.
                    Most of them were young ladies who didn't know anything about teaching, but that
                    was all right, I listened and tried to talk.</p>
                <p>There wasn't much of substance to report under Abbe Youlou. Much of our time was
                    taken up with protocol. Every time Youlou left the country the whole diplomatic
                    corps, or at least the top officers, would have to go out en masse to the
                    airport to see him off. The ambassadors would line up in order of seniority
                    based on length of time at post with their deputies standing next to them. Then
                    the worthy Abbe would arrive in his limousine and he would gravely walk past the
                    ambassadors shaking hands with every one of them as if he were about to depart
                    for years of exile or something like that. And then when he returned the same
                    thing would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was at the request of the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Oh, yes. It was mandated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you seen that in any other country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: I was not aware of it, no. Once in a while we used to go out to meet
                    somebody in the home government if there was a reason to do so, but in the Congo
                    every time the president made a move he wanted his diplomatic corps to dance
                    attendance, and we did. He was always impeccably dressed in a cassock. He had
                    many cassocks of many colors and it was one of our little games to wager which
                    color he would use for this or that occasion. His cassocks were green, red,
                    maroon, white, etc.</p>
                <p>I might also mention that whenever we had to go over to the Foreign Office or to
                    see the president, we would be received in the morning and would be presented
                    with glasses of champagne. The president would join us in drinking champagne.
                    This was not always conducive to an efficient way of getting across whatever
                    message we had to deliver or receiving whatever he had to impart. But really
                    there was nothing worth mentioning about the first period that I can think of at
                    the moment except for atmospherics.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>I might go into that a little bit. Brazzaville is right across the Congo (now
                    Zaire) River from Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), about a twenty minute ferry ride.
                    When I arrived in September, the Belgian Congo across the river, which had been
                    in turmoil, if you recall, from about 1960 on, was beginning to settle down a
                    little bit. The main worry was whether Katanga was going to secede or not.
                    Eventually there was, I think in December, a meeting of the Pan African Freedom
                    Movement for East, Central and South Africa at which all of the leaders of the
                    newly independent African countries assembled and at which we, the American
                    government, tried to get African support for whatever action we were planning to
                    take through the UN to keep Katanga from seceding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Katanga was where most of the copper was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes and a man by the name of Tshombe was in charge of that province. He
                    wanted Katanga to secede from the ex-Belgian Congo. He had close allies within
                    Belgium. Katanga was the richest part of the Belgian Congo.</p>
                <p>In any event, this conference took place and I was seconded to attend because I
                    knew some of the leaders from East Africa. It was a very successful conference
                    and the Africans supported our efforts to keep the Belgian Congo, or what is now
                    Zaire, from splitting apart.</p>
                <p>While the Belgian Congo had been in turmoil, it was settling down, but there
                    still wasn't much in their stores. Our Leopoldville colleagues considered
                    Congo/Brazzaville to be the “big PX”. They used to come over weekly to get
                    supplies from Brazzaville. And there weren't all that many supplies in
                    Brazzaville, if I recall correctly, but they were more easily available than
                    over in Leopoldville.</p>
                <p>We had quite a bit of toing and froing. Ed Gullion, under whom I had served in
                    Saigon, was our Ambassador in Leopoldville. He used to come over to see us and
                    would invite us over to see him, etc. We had a system of what we called “squawk
                    boxes” or two-way radios in the houses of the main officers in Brazzaville and
                    Leopoldville. The idea was that if there was an emergency we would be able to
                    communicate directly with each other. Of course it was a little embarrassing
                    because these things were kept on all the time. I remember we had our small
                    children with us in Brazzaville and our radio was in our bedroom. One time our
                    nine year old second son was pestering our seven year old daughter and she was
                    doing her usual screaming, “Stop it! Stop it!” at the top of her lungs. Finally
                    somebody from across the river in Leopoldville said, “For God's sake, tell them
                    to stop it and leave us in peace.”</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Also we had several demonstrations at one time or another over on our side during
                    which we kept in touch with Leopoldville by squawk box. We had a system of
                    codes. The “quarter deck,” I think was my place; the “bridge,” was the
                    Ambassador's residence, etc. I remember one of these demonstrations started at
                    the crack of dawn, about 5 AM. I was up at that time and duly reported over the
                    radio: “Quarter Deck calling Bridge, crowd is assembling in Poto Poto (the
                    African section of Brazzaville) and beginning to move towards the city,” etc.,
                    feeling very much like a correspondent right on the scene of some great
                    occurrence. Later, Ed Gullion's wife from across the river said to me, “For
                    goodness sake, Hank, can't you get these things started a little bit later?
                    Every time you report something at 5 AM you wake us up and then nothing
                    happens.” So we had to be a little careful how we used this modern
                    mechanism.</p>
                <p>The radios were all above board and everybody knew we had them. It was not a
                    secret communication by any means, but we tried to mask who was talking by using
                    these silly code names.</p>
                <p>In any event, nothing much happened really from the time we arrived in September
                    to the time we were sent home on leave in April. It was a long leave because I
                    was seconded to the counterinsurgency course that all officers had to take at
                    that time over at the Foreign Service Institute. This was one of Bobby Kennedy's
                    pet projects. He felt that we should all know about revolutions,
                    counter-revolutions and that sort of thing. And it was a useful course, I
                    guess.</p>
                <p>In the meantime there was a coup d'etat in Brazzaville (in August, I believe) and
                    I had to cut what was left of my leave short, and hurry back. What happened was
                    that there had been some sort of a labor dispute. A crowd of several hundred
                    people had gathered outside the presidential palace. To make a long story short,
                    Abbe Fulbert Youlou on seeing the demonstrators lost his nerve and resigned on
                    the spot. A man named Massamba-Debat, took his place. The event was an eye
                    opener to me because it made me realize that any person or group that could get
                    together several hundred armed people all with one aim in mind could really take
                    over almost any one of the governments in this part of the world. This is
                    perhaps an exaggeration, but it certainly happened that way in
                    Congo/Brazzaville.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Massamba-Debat had been a rather liberal minister in the Youlou cabinet. He
                    seemed quite friendly to the United States. We were not overly concerned by the
                    course of events because none of us were really great admirers of Youlou.
                    However, it quickly became quite clear that there were forces behind the scenes
                    quite a bit more significant and more malevolent then had appeared to be the
                    case when the takeover first happened. And, indeed, as things developed over the
                    next year or so it turned out that this little country was becoming really the
                    first truly Marxist government in Africa. Behind the scenes there was what they
                    called a National Revolutionary Council, which was composed of a dozen or so
                    Marxists who were very clever. They kept their heads down for a long time. It
                    was not apparent from the beginning what was taking place. It was only gradually
                    noticeable that officials were no longer as friendly to us as they had been
                    before. We thought at first it was because we didn't recognize the new
                    government right away. (It took close to five or six months before we formally
                    recognized it.) That may have started the ball rolling down hill so far as we
                    were concerned, although I think the dynamics of the situation were such that we
                    would have been in essentially the same position no matter what we might have
                    done from the beginning.</p>
                <p>To get back to my return after leave, I left the U.S. on a plane which also
                    carried a Congolese named Charles David Ganao, who turned out to be the newly
                    appointed Foreign Minister in the new government that had just been established.
                    I am not sure I made it clear that the revolution happened while I was on leave
                    and I returned as soon as I was able to secure air passage but didn't actually
                    arrive in Brazzaville until several days afterwards...mid-August or August 20,
                    something like that. The coup, as I recall, took place on August 15. Charles
                    David Ganao was a young man who had been a friend of our USIS librarian who had
                    recommended him for a Leader Grant, which accounted for his being in the United
                    States. I was introduced to him on the plane. He and I chatted. I remember him
                    saying with a very serious expression, “Oh, this is a very difficult position I
                    am going back to.” He obviously was very apprehensive as to what he was getting
                    into. He had just been a minor official up to that point, but apparently he was
                    known favorably by the people who had instigated the coup.</p>
                <p>Another thing of interest is that while Ganao was in America he had formed a
                    relationship with the daughter of an American taxi driver and, indeed, later on
                    while he was in office brought her over to Brazzaville, installed her in his
                    apartment and eventually married her. He was a young man then, certainly not
                    over 40 and probably in his mid-30s. And seemed a very nice chap. I was quite
                    taken with him on the plane. But that didn't last very long as you shall
                    see.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>It is hard to go back and remember just how and why things went to pieces, but
                    they did. When Wendell Blancke left...transferred to the Department where he was
                    to serve as an inspector...in December, I was very upset at the fact that nobody
                    from the Foreign Office or any part of the Congolese government came to see him
                    off. Indeed, one of their ministers was out at the airport meeting somebody else
                    and I said to him, “Our Ambassador is leaving, wouldn't you like to say goodby
                    to him?” He pulled back immediately, visibly shaken, and said, “Well, no, no,
                    that is up to someone in the Foreign Office. That is not in my bailiwick.” I
                    said, “It seems very strange after all the friends Ambassador Blancke has made
                    here and after translating your national anthem, etc. that nobody should be here
                    to say goodby to him.” Then I turned on my heel and left. A few minutes later
                    somebody scurried up, a functionary named Bernard Kolelas who had filled the
                    role of protocol officer in the Foreign Office and who happened to be in the
                    airport at the time. He realized that probably somebody should say goodby on
                    behalf of the Congolese government, so he went into the plane and shook
                    Wendell's hand, thus making his departure a little less stark.</p>
                <p>But things kept getting worse. Up to this time a Chinese Ambassador from Taiwan
                    had been assigned to Brazzaville, a scholarly diplomat named Sampson C. Shen, a
                    very good friend and nice chap. Soon after the revolution, representatives from
                    Czechoslovakia, Ghana, and other less friendly parts of the world appeared in
                    Brazzaville. The Ghanaian Ambassador was particularly obnoxious. He was
                    anti-American and took great joy in baiting us. Sampson Shen, of course, was in
                    a very vulnerable position because the Government of France had eventually
                    recognized Communist China. Here was Brazzaville with a Nationalist Chinese
                    Ambassador still in place. So the handwriting was on the wall. I remember
                    spending many hours with Ambassador Shen, (this was after Ambassador Blancke had
                    left and I was Charg�) trying to figure out ways of postponing his departure,
                    and forestalling what really was inevitable.</p>
                <p>And, of course, eventually the Congolese did withdraw their recognition of
                    Nationalist China and Communist Chinese diplomats arrived in Brazzaville. In
                    those days we were under instructions from the Department that we should not
                    have anything to do with the Communist Chinese representatives. We were not to
                    socialize with them and to ignore them to the extent possible. So my worthy
                    Ghanaian colleague took great pains in putting the two of us, the Communist
                    Chinese Ambassador and me, together at the same table or introducing us while we
                    were standing at a cocktail party. Anything he could do to add to what he felt
                    would be my discomfort. The Chinese Ambassador was just as embarrassed as I and
                    we both would duck and got pretty adept at staring into the distance and
                    ignoring each other. I think we carried out our mutual instructions
                    satisfactorily.</p>
                <p>Youlou, as I recall, was jailed, eventually released and taken under the
                    protective arm of the Catholic Church, which restored him to priestly or
                    semi-priestly status.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>The new government was headed by Massamba-Debat who had been Minister of
                    Planning. He had also been president of the National Assembly. His new cabinet
                    was made up largely of young technicians of whom Ganao was one. They announced,
                    as I recall, that they were going to follow a policy of non-alignment, and
                    eventually established relations with Communist China, the Soviet Union,
                    Czechoslovakia, etc. Israel, Chad, Central Africa Republic, Nationalist China
                    maintained diplomatic relations and then eventually, Sampson Shen, the Chinese
                    had to leave.</p>
                <p>We couldn't put our finger on it, but we just knew that things were not going too
                    well. First of all, Kolelas, who had been quite friendly to us and had been our
                    main working contact in the Foreign Office, was suddenly kicked out or resigned
                    and a man named Gomez took his place. I remember coming to the Foreign Office
                    one day, hearing that Kolelas was no longer there, and innocently saying
                    something to the effect that I was sorry to see Kolelas leave and hoped somebody
                    would give him my regards and express my regret that we would no longer be
                    working together. Then I was introduced to Gomez. Well, a few days later Foreign
                    Minister Ganao called me in and read the riot act to me. He said, “You are
                    interfering with our internal affairs.” I said, “I beg your pardon, in what
                    way?” He said, “Well, I understand that you expressed your opinion on the
                    resignation of Kolelas. This is not your affair and a highly improper thing to
                    do.” I explained that we had worked with Kolelas, that I was not aware that he
                    was in disfavor, and that I had sent my regards to him as a polite way of saying
                    goodby. Ganao said, “Well it was a maladroit thing to do,” and grumpily
                    dismissed me.</p>
                <p>I didn't really understand why he got all heated up about this until several
                    weeks later when we learned that Kolelas had fled across the river to
                    Leopoldville, and was being accused by the Congolese of building up an
                    opposition movement to the new revolutionary government. Of course, if I had
                    known this before, I would have kept my mouth shut.</p>
                <p>Then I recall another episode. Governor Averell Harriman visited Leopoldville,
                    (now Kinshasa but I am going to use Leopoldville because that is what we called
                    it then), and wanted to be briefed on Congo Brazzaville. We were summoned. I
                    came over with the political officer, David McDonough, and we briefed Harriman.
                    He asked me specific questions about the new government. I said I could see
                    evidence of communist influences. I couldn't tell whether the individual members
                    were card carrying communists or not, but this would ultimately come to light,
                    and it seemed to me unmistakable that this was the way things seemed to be
                    moving.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Well, a few days later, Harriman was widely quoted in the press as saying that
                    the new Congolese government was communist backed. He minced no words about it.
                    Whereupon I was summoned by Foreign Minister Ganao who said to me, “Do you think
                    we are fools? Don't you think we know what you are up to?” I said, “I beg your
                    pardon?” He said, “Yes, we know you went across the river to see Harriman. We
                    know what you must have told him because we read the paper and can put two and
                    two together.” I said, “Well, it wasn't like that at all. I told him what I
                    thought was going on here,” etc. etc. Well, what could I say really? Obviously
                    he had me, but I tried to say that Harriman's words might have been taken out of
                    context, that things haven't been going well so far as we were concerned so
                    maybe he was just expressing normal concern.</p>
                <p>Eventually I got a letter from Harriman saying he hoped we had not been too
                    embarrassed by what he had said. I had to say, “Well, not really, probably your
                    words were good medicine for the Congolese.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, our relations with the Congolese continued to go down hill. We began to
                    get hints from the government that they thought the fact that we hadn't yet
                    appointed a new ambassador meant we were about to withdraw recognition or take
                    some unfriendly action against them. So I began to try to spur the Department
                    into getting an ambassador in place, because I felt our only hope of changing
                    the bad tide that seemed to be running out for us was to appoint a new
                    ambassador, try to change the psychological outlook and rebuild the friendly
                    relations we had enjoyed under our former ambassador.</p>
                <p>The Department was obviously working on the appointment of an ambassador and I
                    think they may have speeded the process up a little bit on the basis of what I
                    suggested. Henry (Barney) Koren was appointed. He was an old friend, a fellow
                    Princetonian and Quadrangle Club member as well as a fellow swimmer and soccer
                    player. I knew him from all of these areas. I had never worked with him before,
                    but I welcomed his appointment. And, indeed, he was a very good choice. He spoke
                    quite good French, not as well as Blancke, but pretty fluent. But he was an
                    entirely different type. He was tall, about 6'4”, angular, rather solemn
                    looking-Abe Lincolnesque. He wasn't really grumpy but he had a deep growling
                    voice. This was his first embassy. He had held important positions in the
                    Department, had been attached to the Department of Defense at a high level and
                    may have had OSS connections before that.</p>
                <p>He wanted to run a tight ship. Of course, Wendell Blancke ran a very loose ship,
                    so it took a little bit of doing to get our people used to the fact that we now
                    had a person who knew what he wanted and wanted whatever he wanted right
                    away.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>At the same time, a few days after Koren arrived, Mennen (Soapy) Williams,
                    Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, arrived on a goodwill tour. He was to
                    be the other shell in our double-barreled shotgun approach. The Ambassador was
                    to beef up the Embassy and restore the psychological atmosphere and Soapy was to
                    bolster him and his position. They worked in tandem very effectively. All the
                    government officials they saw were very agreeable and friendly. I remember Soapy
                    Williams going back in the car with Ambassador Koren and saying, “Well, you see
                    it is just a question of personality and personal relations.” I said, “Well,
                    Governor, that may be true and I hope it is true, but I can assure you that I
                    think it is going to take a little bit more than personality to turn this thing
                    around.”</p>
                <p>For a brief period after Governor Williams left, Ambassador Koren enjoyed a short
                    honeymoon. Things looked a little bit better. Then one night I heard some
                    hullabaloo over the squawk box. I gathered that our administrative officer was
                    down by the dock. The Embassy had its own boat, a large motor boat that we used
                    to ferry things across the river, something we continued to do without thinking
                    about it too much. But on hearing this hullabaloo in the middle of the night, I
                    went down to where the noise came from and found Marty Bowe, our administrative
                    officer, trying to screw a spot light onto the top of our boat. What had
                    happened was that some people from the British Embassy in Leopoldville had been
                    out in a small boat which had malfunctioned in some way and had been swept down
                    stream. The British Embassy was very concerned about them and asked us if we
                    would take our large motor launch out on the river and see if we could find
                    these people. I asked whether Marty had checked this out with the Congolese
                    police, which indeed he had, so I gave my authorization to go ahead.</p>
                <p>Well all this took a lot of talking back and forth across the river and pretty
                    soon the Ambassador's car drove up with Barney Koren, the Ambassador himself,
                    driving it. He had heard all of the noise and had come over to see what was
                    going on. He also had some misgivings, but eventually sanctioned our decision
                    and the boat went out. With him, I might add, was the British Ambassador in
                    Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>Well, no sooner had they returned home, (I was not in on this but I heard about
                    it later) there was a knock on their door. There stood Foreign Minister Ganao
                    and another member of the Foreign Office, furious. They had heard all the noise
                    too and knew what was going on. Ganao said to the Ambassador, “Don't you realize
                    that the Congo River is a border between two countries and that you can't just
                    cross the border and go back and forth without permission?” The Ambassador said,
                    quite politely, “We thought we had permission. We had gone through the police.”
                    Ganao said, “No, this is not a matter for police jurisdiction. This is a matter
                    for the Foreign Office.” So they were quite upset. The Ambassador calmed them
                    down a bit.</p>
                <p>This was the first sour note the Ambassador had encountered since he arrived.
                    Various other things happened that I don't really recall which kept things
                    sliding down hill.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>But the really big revelation occurred on the occasion of the first anniversary
                    of the revolution of August 15, when the government held a parade and
                    celebration in the stadium in Brazzaville. We were invited along with all the
                    other diplomats. We came to our seats and noticed that Massamba-Debat was
                    already sitting down with his entire cabinet. At the last moment in walked six
                    or eight men with the unmistakable air of power combined with fake humility that
                    communist officials adopt. I have seen it in China and in Russia. Each one wore
                    a simple khaki uniform and a cap with a single red star in front. They took
                    their places in a special section right in front of the president. They were
                    obviously the Revolutionary Council, or politburo.</p>
                <p>We had heard rumors that there was such an organization...I think they called
                    themselves “revolutionary council”...but this was the first actual time we had
                    seen for ourselves that such an outfit existed. Each of these men seemed very
                    self-conscious, carried himself with dignity, even while sitting down.</p>
                <p>Well, Massamba-Debat got up and made a few of the usual remarks and then said,
                    “But I have something much more important to report to you. We have had a
                    present from somebody. What was this present? Was it a box of chocolates? Was it
                    this or that? No, I will show you what it was.” At that point a flat top truck
                    pulled out into the stadium and rolled in front of the assembled masses. I
                    suppose there were 20,000-30,000 people there. On the top of this truck were a
                    whole bunch of weapons...guns, machine guns, etc. And then, very conspicuously
                    displayed right alongside these weapons were some cardboard boxes with the USAID
                    symbol of clasped hands and the US flag on them. We could hear the crowd saying,
                    “Les Etats Unis! Oh, Oh,” and muttering. Then Massamba-Debat went on to say that
                    these weapons had been smuggled into the country from across the river; that
                    this was a present from those whom they had considered their friends, and more
                    to the same effect. Then he calmed the crowd by saying, “But we must be mature.
                    We must not react too harshly to something like this. We must handle ourselves
                    like the civilized people we are.”</p>
                <p>At that point we realized that this was perhaps the clearest indication yet as to
                    the way the political scene was developing.</p>
                <p>I have to go back a little to say that I had been informed a month or so before
                    this that I was going to be transferred to the Department. My successor, Mike
                    Rives had already arrived in Brazzaville. He was with us as we witnessed this
                    event in the stadium.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Later, Mike and I went around to pay my farewell calls and to introduce him to
                    the various people I had known in the government. When we called on Mr. Gomez,
                    our contact in the Foreign Office, by prearrangement with Mike I decided as a
                    parting gesture to indicate to the Congolese that recent events had not passed
                    unnoticed. I did this, not in an angry way, but as an expression of my concern
                    over the way I thought the relationship between our two countries seemed to be
                    developing; wondering if, indeed, we were headed for a rocky period. I mentioned
                    five or six occurrences, including those mentioned on this tape, as well as
                    various other disturbing episodes which I can't recall. I had prepared my
                    remarks quite thoroughly and had my facts pretty well in hand. I was completely
                    unemotional except to the extent of expressing concern. Mike didn't say anything
                    because he had to keep the relationship going. Whatever they thought of me was
                    no longer of importance since I was leaving.</p>
                <p>Gomez' only reply was, “These things are all separate events. They don't have any
                    connection with each other. There is no trend, no plot, etc.” But, indeed, I
                    think there was. And as events eventually turned out things certainly did
                    continue to go down hill and eventually in February of the following year Barney
                    Koren was withdrawn. His mission had failed and we closed our Embassy. It
                    remained shut for about a dozen years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a little bit of geography, the difference
                        between the east coast and the west coast of Africa, did you notice a
                        difference in the people as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, yes, in the people we dealt with. If you mean the people out in
                    the countryside, the villagers, etc., there were differences but not significant
                    differences. The differences were differences in the different cultures.</p>
                <p>Addressing the first, the differences in officials with whom we dealt with. The
                    most noteworthy difference is of course the language. The people I dealt with in
                    Uganda all spoke fluent English and we could understand each other thoroughly.
                    The people I dealt with in Brazzaville all spoke French. My French was at a 3
                    working level only, so it was difficult to get established on the same footing
                    of trust and understanding I had enjoyed in Uganda.</p>
                <p>Further, other differences could be attributed to the French as opposed to the
                    British colonial background. The Congolese were African Frenchmen more or less,
                    and the Ugandans were African Englishmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an apparent difference in their education? Had
                        the two colonial powers educated their people differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Remember that Uganda had roughly 10 million people and the Congo had
                    fewer than one million people. Having said that, I think on the primary school
                    level, probably the French educated a higher percentage of the child population
                    than the British. It was easier to do that because there were fewer to begin
                    with. But the British had a flourishing university (Makerere) in Kampala and the
                    French, as I recall, had a training school in Brazzaville that went through the
                    first two years of college. I would say that the education of the Congolese was
                    about as high as any of the French Equatorial Africa countries, probably
                    higher.</p>
                <p>The Congolese were considered to be the most advanced group in that part of
                    Africa. In Gabon, for example, many of the technical positions were held by
                    Congolese. Just before I arrived in the Congo there had been a big blowup
                    between the Congo and Gabon, all based on a soccer match, which the Congolese
                    team had won in Gabon. Congo's players had bottles thrown at them when they left
                    the field. Whereupon the Congolese in Pointe Noire rampaged against Gabonese
                    nationals there and severely beat some of them. Whereupon the government of
                    Gabon evicted all Congolese from Gabon. In doing so the Gabonese almost wrecked
                    their economy because they had kicked out the people who were the most
                    technically advanced and educated, and who held the most skilled jobs.</p>
                <p>In the countryside, going to the second part of your question, I would say that
                    the Ugandan tribes were generally head and shoulders more advanced than some of
                    the tribes in the Congo. The main tribe in the Congo, the Bakongo, were quite
                    far advanced and not far behind the Baganda, for example, but the Bateke, a
                    tribe of about 150,000 north of Brazzaville were still quite primitive.</p>
                <p>I remember going to the main Bateke village on two occasions. The first was
                    during a national celebration of Brazza's conquest, or something of that sort.
                    King Makoko of the Bateke was there running things. He was dressed in a red
                    cloak, one eye was painted white and the other red. He had a sparse fringed
                    beard. He would talk to his people like a cheer leader. He would say something
                    and then the crowd would chant in response. Then he would say it again and the
                    crowd would respond again. The atmosphere was rather primitive, if I can use
                    that expression.</p>
                <p>The second time I went there was at the death of one of Makoko's wives, maybe his
                    main wife. Ambassador Blancke and I went up. The roads were terrible...sand and
                    mud. We arrived in the midst of a keening and howling of the remaining wives
                    over the coffin of the dead wife, and we were ushered into the presence of
                    Makoko in a large hut. He was sitting on a “throne” with a number of young wives
                    clustered about his feet. There were two figures, one on each side of the
                    so-called throne, an old man and an old woman. To this day I don't know if those
                    two were mummified or whether they were alive, because they did not move a
                    muscle. They did not blink an eye or even seem to breathe. They sat motionless
                    for the half hour or so that we were in the royal presence.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they may have sat there through the whole
                        funeral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: They may have indeed, if they were alive. If they weren't alive, they
                    were remarkably well preserved corpses.The Bateke were a relatively primitive
                    tribe and kept their customs pretty much throughout the period we were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't travel much up country or into other areas
                        very frequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: It was very difficult. You could only go in one direction for about
                    forty miles or so outside Brazzaville and that was towards Pointe Noire. There
                    was a navigable road all the way out to the coast. But going north, the roads
                    became nothing but tracks. I did take several trips. I took a trip by land rover
                    with our military attach� (Col. Bridenbaugh) soon after I first got there. We
                    drove north of Brazzaville, through Sibiti and M'Binda and into Gabon to
                    Franceville. We were following a railroad track. Colonel Bridenbaugh was on an
                    intelligence tour for the military, checking road conditions, measuring bridges,
                    and so on. I went along to learn something about the countryside. We stayed with
                    missionaries and in one or two so-called hotels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: They were just plain houses with a couple of rooms with beds in them.
                    That was it. There would be a common bathroom.</p>
                <p>The missionaries' lodgings were not bad, simple but comfortable and clean.</p>
                <p>Then later on we took a flying trip. We had a military attach� and an air attach�
                    in Brazzaville. The air attach� had a plane, a C-47. We flew in it up to a town
                    in the north, the name of which I can't remember—I think it was near
                    Imfondo—where there was a young American missionary couple. We visited them and
                    were put up at their house...the whole crew and myself slept in one room. By
                    pre-arrangement we allowed the pilot, Colonel Hensch, and his co-pilot Captain
                    Watell, to have single beds since they were the ones who had to do the flying. I
                    slept in a double bed with one of the crew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the missionaries when the new revolutionary
                        government came in? Were they the object of any attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>VAN OSS: Not really, so far as I am aware, not while I was there certainly. When
                    we went up north to visit the missionaries we took some films with us. The
                    missionary, a very nice young man, Gene Thomas, I think his name was, and his
                    wife and children were there. He was on good terms with the local officials. We
                    had to discuss with the local political “commissar” what our films were going to
                    be. We had to assure him that the films would not contain American “propaganda.”
                    One of our films was a personal hygiene documentary which showed people how to
                    brush their teeth and that sort of thing. As I look back on it that strikes me
                    as having been a little condescending. The other one was a film of Miriam
                    Makeba, the famous South African singer. She was very popular. They loved that
                    film. But the people were bored silly learning how to use a toothbrush. There
                    were lots of people on hand. The screen was right out in the open. The
                    missionary had his own generator and projector.</p>
                <p>So far as I know our missionaries were never evicted or mistreated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that our Embassy people in Leopoldville, for
                        example, came across the river in 1963 to get provisions and supplies which
                        were scarce in Leopoldville. After the revolutionary government came in was
                        there any change in the availability of goods for the population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Yes. As I recall it became much harder to get things on our side of the
                    river. In a sense, Leopoldville took on the role of PX. We used to get chickens
                    and other foodstuffs there. But I don't recall any great change in the economic
                    situation in the short time...you see I was there for only about a year after
                    Youlou's downfall. I would say that in the beginning things did get hard to get.
                    The prices were very high. But it seems to me that despite the fact that the new
                    Congolese government became more and more Marxist as it went along, it still
                    kept quite close ties with the French. French technicians remained in place, as
                    I remember. I think a large number of the French superstructure of embassy and
                    technical personnel stayed.</p>
                <p>Now I don't recall what happened to the French military. There were some military
                    airplanes there, and a detachment of French soldiers. I don't recall whether
                    they stayed on or left. I think they left and reassembled probably in Gabon, and
                    perhaps also in Chad and places like that. I know the French brought troops back
                    into Chad later on when Chad had its trouble with Libya, and I know they brought
                    troops into Gabon when there was an attempt to unseat M'Ba, then president of
                    Gabon.</p>
                <p>There really wasn't too much change in our personal lives between the two
                    different time periods I was there. After the revolution, whenever we went out
                    for a picnic, for example, or left Brazzaville, at some point or other we always
                    would be stopped by a roadblock or by officials who would want to know who we
                    were and what we were doing. There was much more of that sort of thing after the
                    new government came into power.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>But life in Brazzaville, itself, never changed much. It was quite pleasant. We
                    had a swimming club, a tennis club, and a golf club. The French are very fierce
                    competitors. In tennis one was ranked on a ladder and you were subjected to
                    challenges from people below you on the ladder. I remember playing even more
                    than I wanted to because challenges were constantly being issued. There was a
                    golf course, which wasn't bad, except that the greens were really browns: there
                    was no grass, it was all sand. When you were ready to putt one of the caddies
                    would take a rake and a piece of board and smooth out the sand in front of your
                    ball so that it would have uninterrupted access to the cup. If you played your
                    cards right, he would scoop a little channel in the middle of the cleared strip
                    so that the ball would be guided into the cup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the housing like in Brazzaville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Housing was okay, but not great. Our house, the DCM's house, was very
                    small when we first got there. The individual rooms were large, but there were
                    just two bedrooms, a master bedroom for us and the other bedroom for our three
                    kids. We closed off part of the hall, walled it in and made a third bedroom.
                    Eventually another bathroom and bedroom were added. It was a pleasant modern
                    house. Airy and light. The other people had houses of comparable size, but
                    somewhat less modern than ours. The Embassy residence was a very unusual place.
                    It was built in the shape of a ship, more or less. In the center of the living
                    room there was a bar with a mast in the middle which led out to the flag pole on
                    top of the building. There was a very large picture window with no glass in it
                    which looked out over the Congo River flowing past. It was quite roomy, very
                    pleasant and colorful. It was revamped and refurbished for the Korens after the
                    Blanckes left.</p>
                <p>Some of the people lived out beyond the golf course. The air attach�, Colonel Ed
                    Hensch, had a pleasant house out in that neighborhood. He was a very nice,
                    decent person. He decided to raise turkeys, the idea being that he would
                    turnover the establishment to some African friends after he left. He
                    experimented with these turkeys. First, he filled a whole incubator with eggs,
                    but misjudged the timing so the first batch he got were hard boiled eggs, rather
                    than little turkeys. But eventually he had a couple of hundred
                    all-white-feathered turkeys milling around in his yard. But alas, after he left
                    the post and had turned the business over to his African friends, they ate all
                    the turkeys and discontinued the breeding operation. So that was the end of that
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>I would say that the housing was acceptable. It was not elaborate, but certainly
                    acceptable.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>One thing I think should be mentioned, we did do a certain amount of traveling
                    among the countries of former French Equatorial Africa. Originally, right after
                    World War II a single American ambassador was assigned to all of those
                    countries...Gabon, Congo, Central African Republic, Chad. Then by fiat of Loy
                    Henderson it was decreed that each country should have its own ambassador. But
                    the air and military attach�s in Brazzaville were still assigned to all four of
                    the FEA countries. So they would use the air attach� plane to travel from one
                    place to another. Other Embassy personnel used to piggyback on those trips as
                    much as they could.</p>
                <p>I remember very vividly a trip we took to Chad in November, 1963. We were in Fort
                    Lamy on Anne's and my wedding anniversary, November 22. This happened to be the
                    day that President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. We were having dinner
                    with my colleague, the DCM, Bob Redington, and somebody announced at the dinner
                    that the President had been shot and was in bad shape. A little later the word
                    came in that he had died. That put a tremendous cloud over everything. We tried
                    to keep the social graces going, but it was impossible, it was just a sad
                    occasion. Brewster Morris was our Ambassador in Chad at the time, but he was in
                    the field on a camping trip some place and out of touch by radio. Somebody had
                    to go out and get him. But in the meantime, Redington had to do everything that
                    had to be done, put out a condolence book for officials to sign, etc. I felt
                    that I should get back to my bailiwick to help do whatever had to be done there
                    at the time. It was a very traumatic experience. I suppose all of us remember
                    where we were when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and where we were when
                    Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is November 14, 1991. We are interviewing Hendrik Van
                        Oss, a retired Foreign Service Officer. Hank, today we want to talk about
                        periods of time you spent in the Department of State. If you would just give
                        us the dates that apply to the parts you are talking about that will help us
                        to identify where we are.</hi>

                <p>VAN OSS: Well, I had three distinct periods in the Department of State. The first
                    one was from the time I was first employed by the Department in June, 1942,
                    running to 1948 with divisions I will go into when I describe that period. The
                    second period was from 1957-59, including an extra year, 1959-60, when I took
                    African Area Studies at the School for Advanced International Studies, Johns
                    Hopkins. The third period was from 1964-67 and then back on another nine months
                    or so when I attended the tenth Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service
                    Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Before I start describing each of these periods I want to make a general
                    statement about the difference between serving in the field and serving in the
                    Department. In the field, once one attains some degree of seniority, he or she
                    becomes a fairly important member of a rather small group, one of a few American
                    representatives in an embassy or consulate, and therefore a person of some
                    importance, relatively speaking (in the area of assignment). He plays a part in
                    anything that goes on. He meets important visitors from different parts of the
                    world. He participates in any noteworthy event that takes place. So one tends to
                    get illusions of grandeur.</p>
                <p>When one is assigned to Washington, he is back in the State Department with
                    several thousand fellow Americans including hundreds and hundreds of fellow
                    officers and he is a mere cipher regardless of how high a position he holds,
                    short of assistant secretary of State. One also finds that he can't do anything
                    without prior clearance with six or twelve fellow officers in the Department of
                    State. One also has to clear with colleagues in other Departments: Commerce,
                    Treasury, sometimes Agriculture, CIA, Defense. So it takes a great amount of
                    time to get messages out, or policy recommendations accepted.</p>
                <p>Another thing about serving in the Department is that abroad one usually has free
                    housing and a small pittance of representational allowance, plus diplomatic
                    privileges in terms of being able to buy inexpensive liquor and tax-free goods.
                    In the Department you are just like any other American except that your salary
                    is somewhat smaller...or at least it used to be in my day. This is a further
                    humbling factor.</p>
                <p>And finally, by way of general statement, the bureaucracy in the Department of
                    State at the time that I served there, especially during the 1965-67 period, was
                    extremely cumbersome. For example, if one had to prepare a report for the
                    Secretary of State it had to be typed on pica typewriters and no page could have
                    any erasures. Now this was, mind you, in the pre-wordprocessor days when
                    typewriters were typewriters and human propensity to err was relatively high,
                    and when the aides to the Secretary wanted everything letter perfect. I can
                    remember several times staying at the Department until midnight trying to get a
                    two-page memorandum typed up for the Secretary which would fit these severe
                    pre-conditions. Not only were the conditions hard, but the African Bureau didn't
                    have pica typewriters. We had to borrow them from the Secretary's Office or some
                    typing pool in order to meet the requirements. Most of the typewriters in the
                    Department were “elite” or whatever the non-pica print was called.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Having said that I will go back and start off with the first period in
                    Washington. I came down to Washington early in the year 1942 to be interviewed
                    in the Personnel Department. In those days the Personnel Department was in one
                    large room in the Executive Office Building, which was then the old Department
                    of State building. At one time I think State, Defense and Treasury were all in
                    the same building. This is the building to the right of the White House as you
                    are facing the White House. It really was a glorious building with large rooms
                    and high ceilings. It was relatively cool in the pre-air conditioning era. There
                    were swinging doors that didn't come down to the floor that allowed a breeze to
                    waft through the offices and provided relief from the Washington humidity.</p>
                <p>Being interviewed was a very peaceful process. I was sent over to the Department
                    of Commerce, where the State Department had another section, the Division of
                    World Trade Intelligence, and was interviewed by the personnel officer of that
                    division (Norville Sonnebeck). Then I went back up to New York where I was
                    working for W. R. Grace and Company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the whole of the Department of State was not, in 1942,
                        in the old Executive Office Building. Was it scattered around Washington
                        even at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: Well, scattered is too strong a word because it wasn't all that large,
                    but it was beginning to scatter, yes. The Division of World Trade Intelligence
                    was in the Commerce Building mainly because a lot of the work had to be done in
                    close conjunction with the Commercial Intelligence Unit of the Department of
                    Commerce.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was “called” in June, 1942, came to Washington and moved in with four
                    other Princetonians at 1527 “I” Street, NW, the Briar Inn. We lived in a
                    basement apartment, which consisted of one large room with five beds plus a
                    living room which led out to stairs up to the sidewalk. The building belonged to
                    the United Mine Workers of America. If we were on the alert, while sitting in
                    our living room, sometimes we could see the stubby legs of John L. Lewis,
                    himself, passing above us on the sidewalk going to his headquarters around the
                    corner. I think the United Mine Workers owned the whole block at that time.</p>
                <p>The Briar Inn, itself, had been a house of ill repute in the past. It had been
                    taken over by a landlady who put a lock on the door, evicted the professionals,
                    and had taken in boarders. She had about two dozen rooms on the top five floors
                    where FBI secretaries, etc. found a place to stay. And she had a cafeteria on
                    the first floor, where we had many of our meals.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Washington in those days was a very sleepy southern town. The general
                    atmosphere was calm. The waitresses were all white and they all called us
                    “honey,” which I thought rather endearing.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>In the State Department, itself, there were, so far as I knew, no black or
                    African-American officers at all; I was not aware of any African-Americans
                    ranked higher than messenger.</p>
                <p>Although the Division of World Trade Intelligence was indeed an intelligence
                    outfit, it was part and parcel of the Department of State. Its job was to
                    prepare the Proclaimed List of Blocked Nationals, a list of some 8,000 firms,
                    mainly in Latin America, but also in the neutral countries of Europe, which had
                    German or Japanese connections or were owned by German or Japanese concerns. I
                    might say that the Germans and Japanese were extremely careful and clever at
                    hiding and masking their ownership. So it took a great amount of research to dig
                    out such connections. Our job was to read mail intercepts, newspapers, reports
                    from Foreign Service auxiliary personnel, reports from the FBI, any source that
                    we could find.</p>
                <p>We had a very fine system of files in this pre-computer era. Intelligence work is
                    largely a matter of filing information in a retrievable manner. If you don't
                    have good files, you don't have good intelligence. Today you have computers, of
                    course, but in those days there were no computers. Our filing system was set up
                    by a fellow named Bill Irving and consisted of what was called a Chaindex and
                    supporting folders. It was a system whereby the officers, of which I was at the
                    lowest possible level, (P-1, $2,000 a year) would read reports, newspaper
                    articles and the like, and mark pertinent portions with coded colors and
                    symbols. These would give instructions to a staff of clerks who would then
                    excise that item, make copies for cross reference purposes and file the items in
                    the appropriate folders. The name of the company was included alphabetically and
                    by country in the Chaindex, with certain symbols indicating immediately whether
                    the company was on the proclaimed list or on the so-called confidential “watch”
                    list, or whether it was being considered for such lists or whether it was
                    clean.So you could, theoretically, take the Chaindex, flip through it and in two
                    or three seconds have the name of the company, know at once where the file was,
                    put your hand on the file almost immediately and have in front of you what you
                    needed. Nothing special today, but in those days it was quite remarkable, if you
                    think of the cumbersome British system with papers threaded on a piece of string
                    through a hole tying together a whole wad of material. Ours was a very neat and
                    efficient way of keeping track of information.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>The Division of World Trade Intelligence had some very good people. John S.
                    Dickey was the chief. He eventually became President of Dartmouth College.
                    Francis Russell was his deputy and took over when Dickey was taken away to start
                    what eventually became the State Department's Information and Cultural Exchange
                    Division. Francis Russell eventually became ambassador to Israel, among other
                    places. There were many others. George F. (Ben) Franklin later became executive
                    director of Foreign Relations magazine and also Secretary to the Trilateral
                    Commission. Tom Mann eventually became Under Secretary of State for Political
                    Affairs. Gordon Mein became ambassador to Guatemala and was shot and killed.
                    John I. Howell, whom I will mention again, went from World Trade Intelligence
                    into the OSS and eventually became President of the J.J. Schroeder Banking
                    Company. Covey Oliver, became ambassador to one of the larger South American
                    countries. Sy Rubin, Leo Cyr, Doug Heck and others all achieved distinction.
                    This was out of a total group of about 30 officers. So I was basking in
                    reflected glory from my colleagues in WT, and continued to do so all my
                    career.</p>
                <p>The filing system was so good, and so useful that Francis Russell had the idea of
                    applying the system to the collecting of biographic information. He seconded
                    Jack Howell and me to set this operation up. The two of us organized it,
                    modeling it on the mother World Trade Intelligence system of information
                    gathering and filing. We absorbed a unit that had been gathering biographic
                    intelligence for the Latin American Bureau in the Department, and took over the
                    Naval Intelligence biographic records, the Army equivalent, and eventually the
                    OSS Biographic Records section, which was the largest of all. So that in 1945 or
                    '46, the Division of Biographic Information (BI) was set up and I was made at
                    that point Acting Chief. Douglas Heck, later ambassador to Niger and Nepal, was
                    assistant chief. Jack Howell had been drafted and gone into the Army. They had
                    tried to get a number of outside people to take the job of division chief, but
                    for one reason or other they hadn't accepted it.</p>
                <p>I spent two or three very happy years doing biographic intelligence work. We had
                    a division of about 75 people. We had a very efficient system of collecting
                    information and filing it. We could get a report on the Secretary's desk within
                    minutes, if it was required. We prepared biographical reports on the foreign
                    delegates for all the conferences. It was really a highly successful
                    operation.</p>
                <p>Some years later, after I had gone into the Foreign Service, the Hoover
                    Commission made an investigation of the Department and came out with a very high
                    commendation for this little unit. They said it had accomplished its mission,
                    had done so effectively, and was a model of efficiency. Very nice words. I don't
                    take credit for that, but I certainly was involved and was proud to have been
                    involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>In the spring of 1945 I took the first Foreign Service exams to be given after
                    the end of World War II and passed them. I was actually inducted into the
                    Foreign Service in early 1946. But I was asked to stay on at BI until they could
                    find a successor. I did, staying on about two years longer. This whole
                    biographic information operation was really a very gratifying experience. I was
                    working with fine people; good, intelligent, highly trained specialists some of
                    whom we had inherited from the OSS and others we had recruited ourselves.</p>
                <p>I made two very interesting trips during that time. One to the Soviet Union with
                    stop-offs at various European posts en route.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN OSS: That was in the summer and fall of 1946. It took about two months, I
                    guess. My job was to set up biographic intelligence units in each of the
                    embassies visited, mainly that in Moscow. This in essence meant establishing a
                    collection and filing system and showing the people at the post what to collect
                    and how to send the information back. We had special multiple forms they were to
                    use which they could file themselves with copies going to the Department for its
                    own files. That was a vivid and interesting experience.</p>
                <p>The next year I was sent to posts around the world starting in Japan, China,
                    India, around the Middle East and coming out through Greece, Italy, Spain and
                    Portugal. A marvelous opportunity. I helped organize biographic intelligence
                    units at all posts visited.</p>
