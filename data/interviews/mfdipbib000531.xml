                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 27, 1994. This is Herbert Weiner interviewing
                        Dr. Daniel L. Horowitz for the Labor Diplomacy Oral History Program. Dr.
                        Horowitz was the first Labor Attach� in the American Foreign Service. Dr.
                        Horowitz will now give his personal background which led up to his
                        participation in the Labor Attach� Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Like most career selections, I suppose, my own, in regard to the
                    Foreign Service, was by chance. The background, however, involves the kinds of
                    positions I held prior to being included in the Foreign Service. I had graduated
                    from New York University, got my Master's Degree there in political science and
                    labor economics, and had a series of jobs after graduation which involved work
                    in the labor field. My first job was with the Research Division of the National
                    Labor Relations Board in its very early days of 1936 and 1937. With the Labor
                    Department of the State of New York I helped set up minimum wages for women
                    during 1937, 1938, and early 1939. In early 1939 I transferred to the New York
                    State Labor Relations Board as a field examiner. I worked there for several
                    years, then took leave to go to Harvard to continue my graduate work as a
                    Littauer Fellow in public administration. There I completed my doctoral work and
                    was asked by Professor Sumner Slichter, the senior labor professor at the
                    university, to stay on and become part of a new program which he developed.</p>
                <p>Starting in the fall of 1942, he had raised money for a program which became and
                    still continues as the Trade Union Fellowship Program. At the time the
                    fellowship program was limited to American trade unionists, unionists who had
                    had at least ten years experience on a national level, and being Harvard, it was
                    not to be like the typical university trade union training program. It was to be
                    for the development of the national leaders of the American trade union
                    movement. In any event, the group started in the fall of that year. I had the
                    responsibility of executive director of the program and taught two of the
                    courses in the program: techniques of collective bargaining and labor
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>During that first year, as the Second World War was under way, the National War
                    Labor Board had set up a regional office in New England. I became a principal
                    trouble shooter for settling labor disputes in the New England area, which I did
                    in addition to my responsibilities at Harvard. At the end of the school year in
                    the spring of 1943, I made a short trip to Washington to visit my brother, and
                    when Professor Slichter learned that I was going to Washington, he asked that I
                    look up an ex-student of his, who he had heard had recently transferred from the
                    Department of Agriculture to the Department of State, and that at the Department
                    of State, he was doing something in the labor field. I agreed to look up Otis
                    Mulliken and did.</p>
                <p>I got in touch with Otis Mulliken in Washington, had lunch with him, saw him
                    again in the State Department, and he explained that he had been hired in the
                    State Department, because the White House had recommended to the State
                    Department that it develop a program in the labor field. Apparently in the White
                    House, there had been consideration of post-war problems in international
                    affairs, and one of the things which they gave importance to was the fact that
                    labor, both in its trade union aspect and in its political aspect, would have
                    important influence on foreign policy in these countries, both in determining
                    the nature of the problems as well as the policies themselves, and that we had
                    better develop specialists in the Foreign Service who had the background and
                    experience to handle this area in foreign policy. At the time, the Foreign
                    Service was made up of generalists without any long-time specialization in any
                    particular field. During the war the government had begun to hire as “auxiliary”
                    officers specialists of various sorts to fulfill its needs abroad. And so in the
                    field of labor, it was decided in the White House to recommend to the State
                    Department that they do the same in the labor field, starting it off as an
                    experimental program.</p>
                <p>Mulliken explained all this background to me, and said that he found the process
                    a very interesting one at the State Department because there was, by and large,
                    little understanding of this range of problems in State, and that he was
                    discussing how to get an experimental program under way. It would start in Latin
                    America since it was the only area of the world where one had both a normal,
                    that is a non-war, situation, as well as several countries with important trade
                    union movements and political parties of the left influenced by labor. He also
                    introduced me to several people in the State Department who were then concerned
                    with the problems, and we discussed the various aspects of it, purely in terms
                    of a basic interest that I reflected without ever feeling that I was involved
                    personally in the program. In any event, after my return to Cambridge some weeks
                    later, I received a telephone call from Mulliken saying that it had been decided
                    finally in State to proceed with the experimental program, that the program
                    would be started either in Mexico or in Chile, and he wanted to know whether I
                    would be interested in conducting the experiment. I hadn't thought about working
                    in foreign affairs previously, but having been turned down by the Army for
                    physical reasons and feeling uncomfortable in the academic atmosphere during the
                    war, I did want to consider it as well as consult with my wife, who was quite
                    comfortably and interestingly working as an economist for the War Labor Board in
                    Boston.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>We did decide to go ahead, and so in late August of 1943 I came to Washington and
                    began to prepare to go to one of these two countries. It turned out by the time
                    I got to Washington that the decision had been made to go forward in Chile
                    rather than in Mexico, and the reason for that is symptomatic of the kinds of
                    problems that arose from time to time with respect to a specialist program like
                    the labor program. That is, the State Department had written both to our
                    Ambassador in Mexico and our Ambassador in Chile asking for their reaction to
                    having the experiment conducted in those countries. These countries had been
                    chosen because they represented the ones with the most important trade unions
                    and labor influenced political party activity.</p>
                <p>Our Ambassador in Mexico, a well-known and important Foreign Service Officer by
                    the name of Messersmith wrote back at great length deploring the notion of
                    having specialists in the Foreign Service, urging that we maintain the tradition
                    that Foreign Service generalists could do any work required in the Foreign
                    Service. In contrast, the reaction of Claude Bowers, Ambassador to Chile, who
                    had previously been Ambassador to Spain, and had originally been appointed to
                    Spain after having been a speech writer for Roosevelt during the first
                    presidential campaign of 1932, was sharply in contrary to that of Messersmith.
                    He favored the idea and said he would welcome having the experiment conducted in
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>My preparation for going to Chile during the fall of 1943 involved meeting many
                    of the people in State concerned with the country, of course, being briefed
                    background, and making an effort to reach out and meet, consult with people in
                    the labor field, both in government and outside. I met with Frances Perkins, who
                    was then Secretary of Labor and some of her senior officials, including Faith
                    Williams, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and others. All of them
                    expressed interest in the program, but it was quite clear that they didn't feel
                    any particular notion that they would be directly involved in it, other than
                    that there were certain kinds of information they would welcome having of a
                    statistical nature. The interest of the Labor Department in this program
                    developed some years later.</p>
                <p>I should add that one of the principal people in the White House who had pressed
                    for this program was Isador Lubin, who at one stage had been the Commissioner of
                    Labor Statistics, and at the time was a Special Assistant to the President.
                    Given his background, he had, of course, a special interest in the labor field,
                    and had, in 1942, encouraged someone he knew who was on the staff of Harriman at
                    the time assigned to lend lease program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of the Economic Commission to Great Britain at
                        the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: The individual whom Lubin knew was Sam Berger, who was on Harriman's
                    staff as an economist. Harriman encouraged Berger to write him a letter every
                    couple of months about what the situation was in the labor field, and this had
                    developed into a series of letters which were circulated in the State Department
                    as interest generated with regard to the then British situation. I then reached
                    out and met many of the people whom I'd known before, others that I had not in
                    the AFL [American Federation of Labor] and in the CIO [Congress of Industrial
                    Organizations], including Matthew Woll who was head of the AFL International
                    Committee, Jacob Potofsky, head of the CIO International Committee and others.
                    Their interest was considerable, but it was more curiosity than interest in
                    participation.</p>
                <p>As far as language [training] was concerned, there was no systematic program
                    available to me, nor did I have the time for it, but I did study Spanish as
                    intensively as I could. In any event, my wife and I departed for Chile in
                    December of 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you actually appointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: I'm not sure. I think my appointment dated from late August of 1943,
                    and my departure was in December, with the usual several months of preparation
                    involved. In those days planes did not fly at night in commercial routes, and so
                    it took three days to fly down to Chile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May we take up a moment? While you were in the Department,
                        had they also sounded out the rest of the Foreign Service or looked at
                        additional sources for labor officers? I think, for example, in the case of
                        John Fishburn who was already made a technical specialist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, I should have mentioned this. No, not in terms of additional
                    appointments because my going to Santiago was regarded as an experiment to find
                    out whether it was practical to have labor specialists appointed from outside
                    and develop a specialty in the foreign service. However, what had been done
                    during the late summer of 1943, about the time that I was coming to Washington,
                    I don't remember now whether the instruction went out before I left or not. I
                    think not. There was a circular instruction sent out to Latin American countries
                    which included a wide range of questions in the labor field, background
                    questions about the nature of the trade union movement, labor legislation,
                    government attitudes and the rest. It was a typical circular instruction but one
                    that represented the first time that this had been done systematically in the
                    labor field.</p>
                <p>The response to that was rather uneven from embassies. The most —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about when, in 1943?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. As I had mentioned, about the time I was going to Santiago. And
                    so, the answers came in, I was not on the Washington end of this, I didn't
                    follow it nor learn much about it until later, but the most systematic effort to
                    respond to the instruction was done out of Buenos Aires, where an economic
                    analyst, who had been appointed from outside as an economist to the embassy, had
                    volunteered to respond to the instruction and had spent a good deal of time
                    getting up the material for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: His name was John Fishburn, who, because he developed an interest or
                    had an interest already, in the labor field, did continue occasional reporting
                    from the labor field, though his principal responsibility in Buenos Aires was
                    other things. He did, however, if I remember correctly, later in 1945 go on to
                    other assignments. In any event, he later served as a Labor Attach� in many
                    other places. But while in Buenos Aires, he was simply an economic officer who
                    did occasional reporting after this instruction.</p>
                <p>My arrival in Santiago was rather interesting. As we arrived by plane, the usual
                    thing, someone from the Embassy was sent out to the airport to welcome us, and
                    this Foreign Service officer's first words were, “So you are the Communist who
                    has been sent down from Washington.” While said in jest, it did reflect the kind
                    of skepticism and uncertainties felt in the Foreign Service, that Washington
                    suddenly had become interested in the labor field, and that someone who was a
                    labor specialist could be other than someone from the far left.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere in the Foreign Service at the time, one must remember, was still
                    that which had characterized the 1920s, 1930s and earlier, an elite service made
                    up of people who, by and large, came from elite universities, who regarded their
                    service in the Foreign Service as an opportunity to be involved in foreign
                    affairs without specializing in any particular area, but being able to do all
                    the work required. They were quite skeptical about many of the officers who had
                    been appointed during the war to do special tasks, and having the labor field
                    covered in this way sounded like a rather strange operation to them. The fact is
                    that my early experience in the embassy was not all that negative in that the
                    Ambassador, of course, set a certain tone to welcome this kind of activity, and
                    I simply went about my business rapidly developing contacts around the country,
                    first with the government. I did a lot of traveling, and of course Chile was
                    important to the United States at that stage in the war for two reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>First, the country was a principal source of nitrate, which was important for war
                    production. Nitrate mines were run by American companies, Anglo-American
                    companies. The other was the fact that Chile had a fairly substantial immigrant
                    population from Germany, largely the result of the mid-19th Century economic and
                    political conditions in Germany which resulted in large scale emigration from
                    Germany both to the United States and also to Chile. In Chile the German
                    population had settled in one particular region of the country, had maintained
                    their language as the ordinary language spoken in the home and in the schools.
                    Their schools were maintained as German schools. In a strange way, they had not
                    been absorbed into the country enough to have taken on the culture of the
                    country, but rather maintained nostalgically their relationship to Germany.</p>
                <p>This did represent, in some regards, security problems which were of concern to
                    the United States because Chile, having a long coastline into the Pacific with
                    the concern as well for the mining exports. The United States had assigned a
                    number of FBI officers to Santiago to concern themselves together with the
                    Chilean Government with this type of security problem. This was, of course,
                    before the days of the CIA, and the FBI had been assigned this kind of
                    responsibility in Latin America while the OSS, of course, carried on in the war
                    areas.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, as far as I was concerned, the focus was mainly in developing
                    systematically the kind of reporting program and representation program which
                    would be meaningful from the point of view of U.S. interest.</p>
                <p>In terms of reporting, what I gradually. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt? What sort of reception did you get from
                        the local [population] in terms of this is a strange operation for an
                        embassy to be involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. That's an interesting point. I think that by and large my
                    experience was a good one in this regard. First, I should mention that Chile was
                    a country with a long democratic history. It had democratic institutions which
                    had existed since the late last century. It had trade unions which were
                    developed over the years, it had left political parties. It was the only popular
                    front government in the Western Hemisphere during the 1930's and into the late
                    1930s, and the government which was in power at the time that I was there was a
                    center-left coalition, which did not include the Communists, who had been
                    dropped from the popular front government in the very late 1930s. Nonetheless,
                    it was a government which was sympathetic to labor, which had representation
                    from political parties which had strong influence among wage earners; it was
                    accustomed to dealing with the trade union movement, and so government officials
                    were both interested, surprised and welcomed the fact that the United States
                    Government would send someone to specialize in this area. And so my
                    relationships with government officials became quite close and easy.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In the trade union field there was a single trade union movement at the time
                    which combined the very strong influence of Socialists and Communists. The
                    Socialists were the stronger of the two groups, and the head of the trade union
                    movement, Bernando Ibanez, was a Socialist. His deputy, Salvadore O. Compo, was
                    a Communist, and also a Senator.</p>
                <p>I should note that the political party structure and the whole political culture
                    was very much in the tradition of France. By and large, people who could afford
                    to be educated beyond local universities were educated in France before the war.
                    And there had been this long cultural affinity with things French. So too in the
                    political field. The parties mimicked the parties of France. There was a strong
                    radical party, which was, in fact, the major party in power in the coalition at
                    the time that I was there; a radical party which, in French terms, was not
                    radical at all, but rather more center than left. But it included the Socialist
                    Party, the Liberal Party and other parties.</p>
                <p>The party which later became so important, the Christian-Democratic Party, did
                    not exist during the time I was there. Its predecessor, which interestingly was
                    called the “Falange,” had no relationship with Franco Spain, but rather was a
                    kind of Catholic-oriented group which had relatively little representation in
                    Parliament. It was just starting out at that time.</p>
                <p>The trade union leadership, both at the top and in the various regions as I
                    traveled around the country, were friendly, and while I didn't make a point of
                    exclusively having contact with the Socialist trade union officials, it turned
                    out by and large to be the case that these were the ones I had most contact
                    with, but not exclusively. It's interesting that when I returned to Washington
                    from Chile some years later in 1946, I discovered that there had been, on the
                    basis of an anonymous letter, an accusation against me as a security risk,
                    because I had been seen in Parliament, in the Parliament dining room, with
                    Communist deputies and senators. Apparently when this anonymous letter was sent
                    to Washington, Washington sent a copy to the Embassy to inquire what the
                    Ambassador's reaction to it was. There was a second accusation that my wife
                    Loucele had been very friendly with a principal Communist woman in Chile,
                    Graciella Mandujano, who was not a Communist, but was head of the consumer
                    movement in Chile, and Loucele having had some experience in the United States,
                    had advised Mandujano with respect to organizational problems.</p>
                <p>In any event, Bowers answered in a long letter, saying that he was delighted to
                    hear that I had been doing my job and that if I was seen with a Communist in
                    Parliament, it was under his instructions to do so, that there was no way I
                    could conduct my work without having such relationships, and that he was
                    delighted — though he had not known this — that my wife had been a friend of
                    Graciella Mandujano, since he, Claude Bowers, was a very good friend of hers and
                    regarded her as the principal and foremost woman leader in the country. In any
                    event, nothing much came of all this, particularly since the FBI representatives
                    in Chile also took the position that there was nothing to it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, for purposes of clarification, were you the first one
                        to have the title Labor Attach�, and further, you've come back to Washington
                        now, and at that time there was a general expansion of the Foreign Service
                        and of the Labor Attach� Corps. Could you go into why and what the
                        philosophy was behind it, and where we had our principal foreign policy
                        problems that would involve labor, and why the government was so anxious to
                        involve labor in its foreign policy planning after the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: The answer to your first question is yes. I had the title of Labor
                    Attach� and was the first to be named as Labor Attach�. Remember, this was an
                    experimental program at the time, but it moved quite rapidly after the first
                    couple of months. Apparently in Washington after a couple of months of my
                    service in Santiago, the reports must have been rather favorable from the
                    Embassy. I learned later that the desk officer for Chile began to regard my
                    reporting as a principal source of information for his own evaluation of the
                    general developments in Chile. I developed two types of reports on a regular
                    basis. One was the straightforward, generally unclassified economic development
                    questions, statistical and other. The other was a classified report on political
                    developments which covered the labor field, but also reached into the political
                    parties which were influenced by labor, and early became of considerable
                    interest in Washington.</p>
                <p>Within a few months, within a year certainly, of my arriving in Santiago, the
                    decision had been taken in Washington to expand the number of Labor Attach�s
                    rather rapidly. So during late 1944 into 1945 a considerable number of Labor
                    Attach�s began to be appointed, first in Latin America, Jim Bell in Columbia, Ed
                    Rowell in Brazil. Then as the —</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Fishburn become one at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: I'm not sure. I think Fishburn, when he transferred to Uruguay in 1945,
                    was given the title Labor Attach� and assigned to do labor work. As far as
                    Europe was concerned, as the war began to look as if it would be wound up after
                    the invasion of the Continent, a number of Labor Attach�s were appointed rapidly
                    as the countries were liberated in Europe, and even in the case of France, the
                    Labor Attach�, Dick Eldridge, was appointed as part of the staff in London
                    preparatory to go into Paris with the liberation in 1944.</p>

                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. Well, it was a combination. Yes, but he [Eldridge] was the first,
                    then, in Europe. Sam Berger, of course, [was] in London. He was then a captain
                    in the Army assigned to the Harriman mission, and eventually in 1945 to the
                    Embassy where he reported on labor. And then at the end of the war about a dozen
                    labor attach�s were appointed throughout Europe so that the program starting out
                    as an experiment in one country, Chile, after the initial couple of months of
                    experience with it was expanded very rapidly as conditions permitted in other
                    parts of the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes, yes, Adams. John Clark Adams was the first Labor Attach� in Rome.I
                    don't know the exact timing of this, but within a year after the war, there were
                    Labor Attach�s not only in Britain — though [in Britain] without the title, Sam
                    Berger, nonetheless, was a full-time labor officer — [but] in France; in Italy;
                    in Belgium, Smith-Simpson; in Norway, Walter Galenson. There was even an
                    Assistant Labor Attach� in France, Milt Fried, and. . .</p>

                    frame John Correll was appointed Labor Attach� to South Africa, and there was
                    even a Welfare Attach� in Switzerland, Dorothy Sell, I think, was her name. In
                    any event, there was a considerable group of labor attach�s within two years
                    after the experiment started in Chile.</p>

                        was the organization, or how was this function carried out from the State
                        Department? Where did it fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Before we come to that, let me say that as far as the officers in the
                    Embassy were concerned, gradually I believe I was accepted across the board by
                    them, so that there was no problem with personal relationships. This was also
                    true of my work in the labor field, which became an accepted area of interest to
                    the Embassy. It was a peculiar kind of experience I had which represented the
                    extraordinary circumstances at the time, but characteristic, I suppose, at the
                    time of the Foreign Service, too. Before leaving from Chile in 1946, one of the
                    officers asked to have lunch with me. We had lunch, and I went through this
                    disconcerting experience, this officer saying, “You know, when it was announced
                    that you and Loucele were coming to Chile, I remarked to my wife what an
                    extraordinary thing, Horowitz. I wonder how the Jew will fit into the atmosphere
                    of the Embassy. This may very well turn out to be a problem.” Without realizing
                    how insulting he was being, he said, “Do you know, after you and Loucele had
                    been in the embassy for some months, you both fit in so well that we gradually
                    forgot that you were Jewish and accepted you.” The Foreign Service was still a
                    very parochial organization, and it was not part of the culture of that elite
                    organization to accept Jews as normal colleagues.</p>
                <p>To turn to your question, I came back for a short consultation visit in late
                    1945, and by that time the decision had been taken to appoint additional labor
                    attach�s, all, by the way, appointed from the outside. There had also been
                    established within State a division called “Division of International Labor,
                    Health and Welfare Affairs,” ILH, and as part of the labor side of this a number
                    of specialists were being recruited to backstop the labor attach�s being
                    appointed, and also to represent the kind of analytic work which was related to
                    their fitting into the general policy-making operations of the State Department.
                    Strangely, this division was attached to the International Trade Policy Office
                    on the economic side of the Department. It didn't particularly fit, but that for
                    the purpose of organization is what had been done. In any event, when I left
                    from Santiago the following spring, 1946, I had been offered the position of
                    Assistant Chief in ILH in charge of the labor operations and decided I would
                    continue working in this field. I should say that as far as the experience that
                    my wife and I had in Chile, we made more friends, closer friends, than at almost
                    any other post in later years.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>On arriving in Washington in the early summer of 1946, for about three months I
                    did not report to ILH because an old friend and colleague of mine, Just Lunning,
                    had been appointed chief of the then Management Planning Division of State, and
                    he urged that I spend a few months on a project that was then very much on his
                    agenda. The project was that having disbanded the OSS, the overt part of
                    intelligence was assigned to the State Department. And the question that was
                    posed for management planning staff was what organizational structure should be
                    given to this operation. Arrangements were made for my assignment to this
                    project; so I became the one who ran it, and it was for me an enlightening
                    experience, because it meant I had to consult and did consult throughout the
                    Department in the geographic bureaus from senior officials down to desk officers
                    and became well acquainted with the structure and functioning of the Department.
                    The basic question at that time for that project was, did one distribute the
                    function among the various geographic areas so that they would be close to
                    policy-making officers, or set it up as an independent bureau, where it could
                    maintain independence from the pressures of policy and do analytic work in a
                    more objective way. My recommendations were that the latter course be followed.
                    This was accepted by Dean Acheson, who was then Under Secretary of State and
                    that is the structure that was then set up and which continues until today.</p>
                <p>In any event I started in ILH then in the fall of 1946 and it was really quite a
                    singular achievement that Otis Mulliken had been able to gather together
                    consistently high caliber people both among the labor attach�s appointed in the
                    field and on his staff in ILH. People were drawn from outside, and were
                    extraordinarily competent. [They were] not always long-time labor specialists,
                    but [they were people] who adapted well and worked well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this structure, you had a central office, and then
                        there were regional labor attach�s at that time attached to the various
                        bureaus —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was none.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: This was the structure. ILH was the single place at State where there
                    was labor specialization. Within the division, it was broken down by labor,
                    health, welfare, and labor was my responsibility. There was also an economic
                    division separate from that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any input with respect to assigning labor
                        attach�s or picking them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. Well, it played a principal role in this regard. It was Otis
                    Mulliken who did most of the actual recruiting for people because these were the
                    people that I mentioned earlier who were assigned, recruited from outside, and
                    it was Otis Mulliken who did the recruiting, obviously fitting into the
                    personnel system of State so that as the personnel system took care of other
                    considerations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, say. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: But the assignment of responsibility for selecting people rested mainly
                    with Mulliken, and as I say, in ILH the specialists were really quite noteworthy
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in terms of reassigning people in the field. If
                        someone goes from one post [to another], did ILH play a role in that, in
                        shifting assignments of people already in the service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, but you're dealing then with later periods, because when you talk
                    about 1946, you're talking about the first or second year of service of
                    officers. The transfer questions didn't arise until a year or two years later.
                    Meanwhile, what happened in Washington with respect to this whole area is that
                    Labor Department, which had been only academically interested in the development
                    of the program in the very early days, developed a very specific concern and
                    interest in the program as it developed, so that in 1946, I'm not sure of this,
                    I think it was 1946, David Morse was appointed as Assistant Secretary for
                    International Affairs in the Labor Department. He, in turn, brought in Philip
                    Kaiser as a special assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morse was handling the office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. I think that's right. In any event, here were two very energetic,
                    intelligent, experienced people, who took a very considerable interest in the
                    program. Their main thrust during those days became, as one would expect under
                    those circumstances, that of developing an influence in the administrative
                    processes. So your question about transfer, by the time transfer questions
                    arose, they were playing an important role with respect to such transfers in the
                    negotiations which sometimes had to take place in order to work out arrangements
                    for things like transfer. These did not become terribly onerous problems in the
                    early days, because one had at that time an expanding situation, and so there
                    weren't difficult decisions to make. They were decisions that sometimes
                    represented different views, but resolvable.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>And so when I took over the labor function in ILH in 1946, the Labor Department
                    was beginning to play a role in the area of labor attach�s. And on my staff
                    there were people who were really quite competent in each of the geographic
                    areas. There were specialists for each geographic area. By that time Val Lorwin
                    for Western Europe, Irwin Tobin for the British Commonwealth countries, Philip
                    Sullivan for the Far East as it was then called; William Brown, a very
                    knowledgeable fellow for Africa; Sarah Roberts for Latin America, who was
                    eventually replaced by John Fishburn, when he was assigned back to Washington.
                    In any event, among the concerns at the time were how best to have the division
                    fit into the general working of the State Department, because here we were as a
                    division off on the economic side of the Department, attempting to have an input
                    into the problems which were faced every day by geographic officers in
                    geographic bureaus, and this meant, of course, developing liaison with these
                    bureaus, with the desk officers of the individual countries, with the divisions,
                    and these were not always easy to do because quite naturally, we were by and
                    large regarded as outsiders who didn't really belong in the geographic bureaus,
                    and this focused the problem in a way which eventually, end of 1949, resulted in
                    the break up of the division and the assignment of individual labor advisors in
                    the various geographic bureaus, so they would be closer to the operations [of
                    the bureaus].</p>
                <p>But during those years, 1946, 1947, 1948, the program flourished in a way which
                    was really quite astounding in terms of numbers, in terms of the relative
                    competence of people, and by and large the gradual acceptance within our
                    Missions abroad of the useful role that a labor specialist could play and did
                    play in the general operations of the embassy. As one would expect, the amount
                    of acceptance varied a great deal. A good deal depended on the personality,
                    competence and energy of the individual officers assigned to the labor field. As
                    I have mentioned, they were at that stage all from the outside. The first
                    officer assigned as a career officer assigned to the labor function was you,
                    Herb Weiner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about? I know what happened to me, but I
                        don't know what went on behind me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, it was kind of interesting because here was a young officer who
                    had just been accepted into the Foreign Service who happened to have a doctorate
                    degree from Columbia in the labor field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came a few years later. I had a good part of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Who had graduate work in the labor field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a Master's. I had most of my doctorate done by
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: And who expressed an interest in doing work in the labor field. And of
                    course this was welcome. There was no argument about the desirability of using
                    someone like that either in the ILH or in the Labor Department. And so it was
                    resolved rather easily among the labor specialists at State and Labor, but
                    required, of course, the blessing of the personnel system. And there too, it did
                    not turn out to be a terribly complicated process, though regarded as somewhat
                    unusual because the personnel system of State was not accustomed to having
                    someone who was a career officer assigned to this specialty. It was the first
                    time was done, but it was done without too much pain and trouble, and there you
                    are. You ended up assigned to London as assistant to Sam Berger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1947, and instead of going to Reykjavik to which
                        I was originally assigned to do visa work, I went to London, which I
                        accepted gladly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. So this was the first time, and yet it was regarded as an
                    exception because there was relatively little interest in that, so long as the
                    avenue was open to recruit people from outside. It seemed more satisfactory to
                    have people with specialized background go in, land on their feet, be able to do
                    their job immediately, if they fit into the culture of the Foreign Service —
                    This was the big if. — than the other way around, which, of course, was the way
                    it developed later. In later years, when the question of recruiting from outside
                    became more restricted for budgetary reasons, then the system gradually changed
                    into one of training people within the career service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, could you describe relationships at this point with
                        the American trade unions, because there was so much international activity
                        that was just exploding at that time, and the role this was playing within
                        American foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. I think this is important to follow, because what gradually
                    happened in those years was that the labor movement, which had always had an
                    interest in international affairs, institutionalized that interest and developed
                    important influence from World War II onward. The AFL had had a long history of
                    concern and interest in international affairs. It was started by William
                    Gompers, head of the AFL, in the early part of the century, and yet it had never
                    been institutionalized particularly. The AFL had, for a time, been a member of
                    the International Federation of Trade Unions in the 1920s, but had dropped out,
                    dropped its membership for a time when it seemed to them that the IFTU, the
                    International Federation of Trade Unions, was too much under the control of
                    Socialists.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>What happened, however, during the war was that on the side of the AFL, because
                    of the energetic interest by David Dubinsky, Matthew Woll and a few others,
                    including George Meany, the Free Trade Union Committee was established. And the
                    effort of the Free Trade Union Committee with its — I'm not sure whether he was
                    called secretary or director, Jay Lovestone, whose background, of course, was
                    rather special and different from that of the usual AFL people. He had been head
                    of the Communist Party in the United States at a young age, in his 20s, for a
                    couple of years when Stalin threw him out and replaced him. He had gone then
                    through an evolution, first forming an opposition Communist group, then
                    gradually shifted his orientation to that of strong anti-Communism. In any event
                    he had been named by Dubinsky to run the day-to-day work of the Free Trade Union
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>The concerns of the Free Trade Union Committee were several: Try to get trade
                    union people whose lives were in danger out of Europe; get the leadership out so
                    that they could someday return and recreate trade unions; to attempt to have
                    some influence on the Allied governments with respect to the importance of
                    getting the people out, cooperating with OSS through the contacts they had among
                    trade union people in Europe, to obtain intelligence information in occupied
                    Europe, and then toward the end of the war, more the AFL as such than the Free
                    Trade Union Committee, — the Free Trade Union Committee was the dynamic element,
                    however, in shaping the attitude toward the structure of the international labor
                    movement. As the war drew to an end, conversations started in 1944 among the
                    British Trade Union Congress and the CIO with the Soviet Trade Unions to
                    establish an international labor organization which would include all trade
                    unions. This was part of the atmosphere of “One World” at the end of the war,
                    the feeling that we could overcome basic ideological differences by cooperation.
                    They succeeded in obtaining widespread support and organized the World
                    Federation of Trade Union (WFTU). The AFL was the single, most important
                    organization to hold out against this policy and refused to join the WFTU. The
                    AFL played an important role in attempting on its own to build free trade
                    unions, that is, democratic trade unions in the devastated countries as they
                    were liberated in Europe. So the AFL became very heavily involved in that
                    process.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>And the CIO, of course, had an internal problem in this regard as it related to
                    policy positions, because it had within its ranks very strong Communist
                    leadership in several of their important unions, and this affected the kind of
                    balance which resulted in positions taken. I don't want to go into the history
                    of the fall away from the WFTU into the establishment of the ICFTU. Mainly let
                    me say, however, that the precipitating element in this regard was a
                    governmental policy: the decision on the part of the American government that it
                    could not afford to permit Europe, European countries, to continue in the
                    devastated state without hope of recovery without a very special effort from
                    outside, an aid program which became the Marshall Plan to reestablish economic
                    progress and recovery in Europe. That program which started out as an effort to
                    offer the Europeans the possibility of recovery, and which did not in its
                    initial form exclude East Europe or the Soviet Union, did, however, end up with
                    the condemnation from Moscow of the program with Moscow preventing
                    Czechoslovakia, which was interested in participating in the program, from
                    participating. This was before the coup in Czechoslovakia. The USSR also
                    prevented Poland [and Yugoslavia] from participating.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, what happened then was, on the basis of the initiative taken by
                    Ernest Bevin, then Foreign Minister in Great Britain, an organizational
                    structure developed among the Europeans for allocating the resources supplied by
                    the United States to Europe. This represented a watershed as far as the World
                    Federation of Trade Union was concerned, because the Communist unions, taking
                    their signal from Moscow, opposed the Marshall Plan program; whereas the
                    democratic unions of the Western Europe, and here the CIO found themselves
                    basically in agreement with the AFL, supported of the Marshall Plan. As the
                    Communists used the WFTU to attack the Marshall Plan, the result was a split in
                    the organization with the creation of the ICFTU, the International Confederation
                    of Free Trade Unions, after an intermediate period of European unions with the
                    AFL and CIO functioning alongside the WFTU as a European Recovery Committee of
                    Trade Unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The ICFTU didn't, as I recall. It had its first

                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: . . . to cooperate with the Marshall Plan American institutions, and to
                    further the objectives of the Marshall Plan. This represented the staged,
                    gradual climax of difference within the WFTU, and then as you say, the
                    establishment of the ICFTU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I may interrupt at this point, I remember that well,
                        having been the Embassy control officer for the meetings. And one of the
                        rather interesting features in just making the physical arrangements was
                        that while the AFL and the CIO both participated, yet you couldn't put them
                        together in the same hotel because of a lot of personal animosities that
                        carried through at the time, and also policy differences on other matters.
                        Sorry, go ahead, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, just a humorous note in that regard. Earlier in the September
                    1948 meeting on the Marshall Plan set up by the trade unions, at that
                    organizational meeting I happened to be staying at the same hotel in London with
                    the AFL contingent, Dubinsky and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Irving Brown was there at the time. Oh, yes. And Jim Carey
                        came from the CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Transportation turned out to be difficult. It was the New Hyde Park
                    Hotel, and no taxis were available. Gradually the people from various stages
                    found themselves in front of the hotel frantically looking for taxis until Dave
                    Dubinsky noticed a truck, an open one of these one-ton open slat trucks stopped
                    to unload baggage. He negotiated with the driver to have everyone transported to
                    Transport House where the meetings would be held from the center of London. And
                    so all these high-powered trade union people found themselves clamoring up on
                    top of the open truck and holding onto the slats, riding through London to
                    arrive at Transport House where the horrified TUC officials had to welcome the
                    American delegation off this undignified truck.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: TUC stands for British “Trade Union Congress,” who was the
                        host.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Interest was very deep and very significant at the time. In the United
                    States, both the AFL and the CIO helped organize grassroots support for the
                    Marshall Plan when it had to face the congressional committees and in obtaining
                    appropriations.</p>
                <p>As far as trade union interest in the Labor Attach� program is concerned, they
                    obviously developed an interest as the program developed. They were not
                    responsible for, nor did they push for in those very early days, the development
                    and expansion of the program. But as it did expand, as it did take place, as
                    their own interests in international affairs expanded, so they developed an
                    interest in the labor attach� program. More importantly, in terms of
                    precipitating the interest at the time that the Marshall Plan structure was set
                    up, there was the decision based on earlier decisions taken with regard to the
                    Greek-Turkish aid program that there should be labor specialists assigned, and
                    that many of these specialists would come out of the trade union movement. The
                    feeling was that this kind of a program would have more effect in these
                    countries where trade unionists on the American staff could deal directly with
                    trade unions in these countries.</p>
                <p>I referred back to the Greek-Turkish aid program, because in 1947 when the
                    British walked away because of financial difficulties from their role of
                    providing the major support in the Greek situation and the Turkish situation,
                    when in Greece a civil war was in progress, Truman made the decision that the
                    U.S. would take over responsibility that the British had dropped in the laps of
                    the Americans. A mission was sent out first to Greece and an American trade
                    unionist, Clinton Golden of the Steel Workers, was appointed as the labor
                    specialist in the mission; he took with him Alan Strachan, who also came out of
                    the trade union movement and later played a role as Labor Attach� in several
                    countries. The trade union situation was regarded as crucial in the Greek Civil
                    War and before the American program got under way a joint US-British team was
                    sent to Greece to analyze and try to affect the situation. Sam Berger was
                    temporarily assigned from London and worked with a British counterpart, Braine.
                    Their efforts met with considerable success. To continue the program,
                    Smith-Simpson was transferred to Athens from Brussels to be the U.S. Labor
                    Attach�. This is the background against which the Greek-Turkish aid mission
                    included American trade unionists. The Marshall Plan missions in turn gave
                    importance to labor matters and included labor specialists, frequently recruited
                    from the American trade unions. The American trade union movement played much
                    less of a role with respect to the Labor Attach� program in those years. It
                    became more important in succeeding years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, at this particular time there was a parallel
                        development going on in Germany over the recreation of the German trade
                        union movement as a way of obviating the return of Right-wing militarism and
                        so forth in Germany and the role that Lou Wiesner played there as labor
                        attach� and advisor to Lucius Clay and the very active role of the old AFL
                        in Germany, particularly Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: That's right. This was true in Germany at that time because of the
                    ideological and power conflict that took place among the occupying powers. The
                    cooperation among the four powers, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States
                    and France, gradually broke down, as we all know. I don't want to go through the
                    history of the beginning of the Cold War, but the fact is that in the American
                    Zone, as in the other Western Zones, the effort was made to influence the
                    structure and the orientation of the unions. Within the American Military
                    Government there were individuals who clearly had pro-Communist leanings. In one
                    or two cases they even went over to East Europe when accused of being
                    pro-Communist and made a career in the East European countries. There were many
                    others who were innocent in this regard, and who sometimes played the role of
                    helping Communist objectives without knowing it. Part of this then took place in
                    terms of the inter-governmental relations, partly within the American
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Lou Wiesner has, I understand, already taped an interview where he has developed
                    this rather fully, and of course he had a long document which I remember
                    guarding very carefully in our security system because it was so highly
                    classified (and has since been declassified), which gives a full account of the
                    internal differences of this sort which took place during that period in
                    American Military Government. I don't want to develop it here because, as I say,
                    Lou has held forth quite completely about it. But the fact is that this kind of
                    set of considerations played a vital role in determining the future of the trade
                    union movement in Germany. Vital to this, of course, was the role, in addition
                    to the American government, played more directly by the AFL and CIO, mostly the
                    AFL. It was Henry Rutz who played the most important role. He was the
                    representative of the AFL in Germany, and had enormous influence on a day-to-day
                    basis in affecting military government attitudes and because of his relationship
                    with the German trade unions.In quite a different way you had the same situation
                    developing in Italy. No need to develop that. The fact is that back in
                    Washington where we sat, we of course had close relationships with the Marshall
                    Plan office in Washington, as with our labor attach�s who cooperated in these
                    regards as Lou Wiesner did in Germany. It was an exciting period, and I don't
                    think it's necessary to go into a lot of detail about the Marshall Plan, because
                    here there are others who played important roles in Europe and have recorded
                    their experiences.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, as you know, at the time when the Cold War began to
                        evolve, what was interesting from our point of view is that at that time
                        there were rumors sweeping Europe that the Soviets might try to take over
                        Western Europe by military force because their army was still relatively
                        intact and the Allied armies were largely coming apart. Instead, they didn't
                        do that, and they began to wage war first almost surreptitiously in the
                        factories using industrial issues for political purposes to impede
                        production. This, I often wondered, how did this look in terms of how was
                        the Cold War seen as it evolved? How did it look from the Washington end,
                        and particularly since the Cold War began to develop as a sort of industrial
                        guerilla warfare on the factory floor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, there was little disagreement in Washington, mainly because of
                    the position which the Soviet Union had taken first in rejecting the Marshall
                    Plan and insisting East European countries do the same, then in their effort to
                    destroy or prevent any progress through the Marshall Plan in the recovery of
                    European countries. This was done so directly that there was little expectation
                    among the officials in the United States in Washington that one could bridge
                    this gap. It became perfectly clear that if Western Europe, and by Western
                    Europe was meant mainly France and Italy, were to be saved from falling into the
                    hands of the Soviet Union, it had to develop institutions, and primarily a trade
                    union movement which would be both strong enough and democratic enough to
                    withstand the attacks on the society by the Soviet Union. When I say society, I
                    mean that in France, as you hinted, in the winter of 1947-1948, once the basic
                    decision had been made by the Soviet Union to oppose the Marshall Plan, the
                    Communist trade unions of France were their chosen instrument. Aside from the
                    Catholic unions, which were of relatively little importance at the time (they
                    became more important later), the trade union movement was unified in the CGT
                    and was dominated by the Communists. When the CGT was used as the instrument to
                    attempt to destroy the French economy by having a general strike declared in the
                    winter of 1947-1948, in a country which was still devastated and had not started
                    to recover, it became perfectly clear to anyone in Washington that this had to
                    be opposed in any way that was possible. So there was little argument about
                    it.</p>
                <p>As you know, in France there was a split in the CGT with the Force Ouvriere
                    established by the non-Communist elements including the Socialist unionists and
                    others to lead a back-to-work movement which succeeded, and which then continued
                    as a permanent trade union organization in competition with the CGT. In Italy
                    the same kind of tactic was followed, a little more subtly, as only Italians can
                    be. The Moscow orders obviously were the same, or at least the Communist
                    conclusions were the same, but it was not done in dramatic fashion as in France
                    by calling a general strike. They simply achieved the same purpose by having
                    rolling strikes, each with a flimsy excuse of economic objectives, but perfectly
                    clearly as one province and industry after another was closed down, the
                    objective was the same as that in France. And here there was a gap of time
                    before one had a series of splits in the trade union movement because here too
                    you have a unified CGIL. Nonetheless, it did begin the following year.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>As far as the Washington end was concerned, there was never any doubt that these
                    kinds of developments were vital to the future democratic existence of these
                    countries, and the important role that was played more directly in attempting to
                    bolster the democratic elements was played by the AFL. This was a heroic period
                    for the AFL, played largely by Irving Brown with a few others, but Irving Brown
                    mainly as the European representative of the AFL in that very trying period of
                    1947, 1948 and 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, you've touched on a very, very important point here
                        looking at it from a European perspective, that while there was no division
                        in the United States with respect to what the Soviets were up to, there was
                        always a very important degree of ambivalence in Europe, all through Western
                        Europe in terms of how to deal with the Soviet Union, and this became a very
                        important policy difference between European countries and the United
                        States, so that in any of these countries, France, you mentioned a split,
                        Italy you mentioned a split, in Britain there was a lot of ambivalence and
                        sympathy saying, “Well, the Soviets are not so bad.” In Germany, there were
                        problems too that became a drag on American policy with respect to the
                        Marshall Plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, as seen from Washington, I think it was more Britain than the
                    other countries because the Trade Union Congress, the TUC, played, as you say,
                    this kind of ambivalent role, and they continued to play that ambivalent role
                    straight through up until the time when they were still having dealings only
                    with the official unions and ignoring Solidarity when it started in Poland in
                    the 1980s. The British played that role because of ideological blinkers, which
                    is strange in that it is not Marxist in origin, in contrast to the continental
                    unions, but idealistic in origin. Yet, it did play that role. Less so in France,
                    Italy, or Germany, because in these countries stark reality overcame
                    illusions.</p>
                <p>I remember meeting with some of the Socialist trade union leaders in 1948 in
                    Berlin during the Air Lift, and the attitude was, we've learned our lesson.
                    Hitler taught us a lesson. No longer can Socialists argue for the
                    nationalization of all industry. That much power in the hands of anybody will
                    destroy democracy. And the predisposition of these Socialists was confirmed, of
                    course, with the very direct opposition which they faced from the Communists
                    both on the governmental level and the trade union level. [This was] true to a
                    somewhat lesser extent, but still true in France. What one found — and in this
                    regard there is some similarity with the British trade unions — what one found,
                    but to a lesser degree and to fewer people, were Socialists who still regarded
                    somehow that their Socialist orientation had a kinship with Communism, because
                    they both came out of the extreme left or left Marxist ideology, and that while
                    the Soviet Union was all wrong in the turns it had taken, that somehow there was
                    some kind of kinship. There was this kind of visceral reaction. That gradually
                    disappeared with the immediate events which caused them to have to fight for
                    their political lives within the trade union context.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In Italy, of course, it was different in that the Socialist party drew different
                    lessons than that of the German or French Socialist Party, and the Italian
                    Socialist Party, the Nenni Socialist Party, resolved that to develop and defend
                    democracy in the aftermath of fascism, one must never split the left. And that
                    resolve never to split the left, of course, made the Socialist Party for many
                    years simply a Communist fellow traveler organization. It started out as the
                    strongest party in Italy, and ended up as nothing more than a weak support for
                    the Communists. It wasn't until the end of 1950s and gradually by early 1960s
                    that the Socialists completed the split away from the Communists. So in Italy
                    you had that ambiguity. It was only the split within the Socialist Party itself
                    which reflected the differences when Saragat in early 1947 led a split in the
                    Socialist Party, and then in 1948 and 1949 a whole series of other splits took
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Tape I you described some of the political developments
                        in Western Europe with which you had to contend in Washington. There was a
                        large expansion at that time also in the labor function generally into all
                        our aid programs and all these things that were spawned by the Marshall Plan
                        in its early days; and as the world grew, so to speak, in other words, as
                        you began to get newly independent countries with nascent trade union
                        movements and our aid program largely expanded, could you give some
                        indication of the kind of policy considerations that went into this at the
                        Washington end and where the labor role might fit in and why it should be
                        important in expanding into our aid policy, or the other policies that were
                        hand maidens of our foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. Well, I think I referred to this already in Europe in that with
                    the lines so sharply drawn as the Cold War developed, and the necessity for
                    achieving recovery of the economies and political stability. . . The role that
                    labor played in all of this was vital and clear to anyone concerned with the
                    situation at all, in that labor obviously had been used and could be used as a
                    means of unstabilizing economies, destroying political structures, and in
                    general was a favorite weapon of the Communists. In any event, this obviously
                    made labor a prime target for us as well, and this in turn meant that we had to
                    maintain contact with labor in its various manifestations and in various ways. I
                    have already referred to the Marshall Plan representation. There were, as you
                    mentioned, alongside the European mission programs, development of labor
                    specialists in other geographic areas as well.</p>
                <p>In any event, without spending too much time on this, it became clear within the
                    State Department that labor had an important role to play, and it was not
                    accident that around that time, 1948, 1949, the place which the labor function
                    had in State was reconsidered, and it was decided in late 1949 that the labor
                    division was to be broken up into assignment of labor advisors in each of the
                    geographic bureaus where they could then be closer to the operating parts of the
                    department, and this, in fact, was implemented at the beginning of 1950. I
                    should mention that I took a long leave of absence from the end of 1949 until
                    the fall of 1951 to do research on a book on the Italian labor movement, and
                    spent most of that time in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been European Labor Advisor in that break up. When
                        the ILH broke up, you became European Labor Advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: No. When I left, ILH was about to break up, but I knew I was leaving.
                    There was a kind of interesting mix up with respect to the assignments, because
                    what happened at that time was that the European Bureau (EUR) and the Middle
                    East Bureau (NEA) had a question about who would be assigned to which, and we
                    had in ILH in the planning agreed that Irwin Tobin would be recommended to the
                    European Bureau as Labor Advisor, and that Bernard Weisman would be recommended
                    to NEA as Labor Advisor. In NEA, somehow Bernard Weisman sounded and seemed
                    Jewish, and they didn't want a Jew as Labor Advisor. Tobin sounded and seemed
                    Irish, and so they said they would take Tobin, and let Weisman go to Europe. The
                    only problem with that was that Tobin was Jewish, and Weisman was a practicing
                    Catholic, and so we got that straightened out eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they explain this business about not wanting a
                        Jew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, on straightforward grounds that given the conflict that existed
                    within the Middle East, it would be more difficult to handle the problems if a
                    Jew were a Labor Advisor. But that was straightened out soon enough. It was a
                    rather amusing side show. Philip Sullivan, who had been on the ILH staff and was
                    a long-time Far East specialist, became Labor Advisor to the Far East [Bureau].
                    So it went. I went off then to Italy. During the time I was in Italy I had
                    relatively little contact with the Embassy [in Rome].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was the European Labor Advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Irwin Tobin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I thought he went to the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: No, no, no. They straightened that out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That got straightened out. Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: So Tobin went to Europe, and Bernard Weisman ended up after a time in
                    the International Organization Division concerned with ILO matters, which was
                    really what his specialty had been.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>As I say, while in Italy I had contact with Tom Lane, whom of course I knew well.
                    He had by that time been named Labor Attach� having previously been a labor
                    specialist in the Military Government. We had our differences. Nonetheless,
                    there was no problem with the relationship there. I didn't see him very often,
                    because I felt, as I think he felt, that it would be better if I simply stayed
                    away. I did not want to be labeled as someone who was representing the Embassy
                    in the widespread contacts or relationships that I developed in my research. In
                    fact, it's rather interesting that there were differences in attitude which were
                    the result of a different role that I was playing.</p>
                <p>For example, when the UIL was established in mid-1950, no one from the Embassy
                    showed up at the convention. I was the only American who was there. I was free
                    to go there, because I was an observer. I knew all the people involved anyhow,
                    whereas from the Embassy point of view it was perfectly understandable. The UIL
                    was established despite the efforts of the American Embassy to develop a single,
                    non-Communist trade union opposition to the Communist unions; whereas the
                    tradition, the history, the background of the Italian political and trade union
                    relations were such that the Christian Democrats, who dominated in the CGIL and
                    the successor organization CISL, would have found it very difficult to share
                    power with the Social Democrats and Autonomous Socialists, and this latter
                    element would have found it very difficult to work under the domination of
                    Christian Democrats. The result was a split among the groups. No one liked the
                    split, but that was the reality.</p>
                <p>The Embassy refused to cooperate, and let me just make one point about this and
                    then I'll leave that period. The Korean War started in June of 1950. At the time
                    when the war started no one was sure in Europe whether that was a feint by the
                    Soviet Union, and that the real objective was aggression in Europe. There was
                    great fear that this might happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: And this permeated all parts of society. Now this was particularly
                    relevant in Italy, where the strongest union was the Communist union, CGIL, and
                    the non-Communist unions, the CISL, predominantly Christian Democrat, UIL just
                    organized and predominantly Democratic Socialist. The official U.S. attitude was
                    that the UIL was an illegitimate organization, because it wouldn't join with the
                    CISL in one organization, and that therefore every effort had to be done to
                    destroy it and or force it to merge with CISL. When the Korean War started, I
                    was on leave of absence, but nonetheless I felt I should make my views known,
                    and I wrote a memorandum. With the possibility of war in Europe, if the Soviet
                    Union moved toward Italy, the Communists and the CGIL would be able to dominate
                    all of industry, and that the effort had to be made before that started to
                    maximize the strength of the non-Communists. Forget ideology, forget the
                    desirability of only one organization. As long as one had two organizations,
                    strengthen them both as rapidly as possible in order to overcome, to some
                    measure, the Communist domination of industry.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I wrote this memorandum and intended for it to go to only two people in the State
                    Department: Paul Nitze, who was then head of Policy Planning, whom I knew, and
                    to Perkins, who was Assistant Secretary for Europe. In the handling of that
                    memorandum, I thought I had made adequate arrangements. Instead, it was
                    delivered to the external branch of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    (INR). In other words, it was treated simply as a public contribution, and
                    interpreted to be the outline of the book I was writing; of course, it had
                    nothing to do with my book. It was distributed widely as an unclassified
                    document. It created quite a bit of a stir, and I won't go into it, some
                    embarrassment for me from a security point of view which never really
                    materialized, but people worked at it very hard.</p>
                <p>Fortunately when Tobin saw it, he recognized it for what it was and insisted that
                    it be classified with circulation very limited. He got it recalled, but it was
                    too late; it had gotten all the way around government, and into the AFL where,
                    of course, the difficulties developed. But so much for my. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this raises a very important broader question, Dan,
                        and this is an excellent illustration of that. Although both the American
                        Trade Union movement and the State Department and the labor attach�s are
                        active abroad often on the same issues, there's been a tendency to label
                        them as having identical objectives, or being a rather than one following
                        government objectives and the other following trade union objectives. In
                        your experience, how have you seen those objectives diverge, and yet within
                        the general framework of being on the same, shall we say, ideological
                        line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: By and large I don't think there was a sharp dichotomy. I think in the
                    case of the Italian example that I cited, there was an identity of interest. The
                    objective was the same. And, in fact, the policy followed both by the AFL and by
                    the American government was the same as it related to the UIL. The difference
                    arose interestingly with the CIO, which favored the UIL again as against the
                    CISL. That is, they did not take the position that I had urged in this
                    memorandum. They took the position that the UIL should be supported but the CISL
                    not, because here again, it was —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But both were non-Communist federations splitting up the
                        old CGIL.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Both were non-Communist, one basically Christian Democratic oriented,
                    one Democratic Socialist. But in the CIO, it was the Reuther attitude that
                    Socialists should be supported. And therefore, you had that kind of dichotomy
                    between the two organizations. But the CIO counted relatively little in Italy;
                    whereas the AFL counted for a good deal. My position in that regard was that it
                    did not matter whether you're right or wrong logically. If a policy did not
                    succeed, you had to look for a different policy. It was perfectly clear that the
                    policy of forcing the UIL to disband and join with the CISL was not going to
                    work. If it was not going to work, then you have to look for some other policy,
                    whereas the effort here had become ideological. No one would review policy on
                    the basis of it not working. It was that we have to keep trying. Eventually both
                    the State Department and the AFL realized that the UIL policy had to be changed.
                    But that came a few years later.</p>
                <p>However, there are considerations that would sometimes result in a difference of
                    attitude. For example, when France was attempting to hold on to its North
                    African colonies, first Morocco, then Tunisia, and finally of course, most
                    drastically, Algeria. The American Government, by and large, attempted to get
                    the French Government to move on these issues, but did not force the issue,
                    whereas the AFL took a straightforward anti-colonial position, so you had a
                    difference in that regard with respect to colonial matters. This was
                    particularly true as one entered the Algerian period later on in the mid-1950s,
                    when Irving Brown was almost declared persona non grata in Paris and his life
                    was in danger because of the sharp differences between the AFL position as
                    expressed by him and the French Government, whereas the American Government was
                    much more soft on this issue because of wider consideration. There are such
                    situations that develop in which you do get a divergence in view, but they are
                    the more exceptional situations rather than typical. The differences which
                    developed then are not on a continuing basis, but rather in individual
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I raised the issue because I had heard, and I'm sure you
                        did too in your own experiences, that others, particularly the left,
                        particularly the Communists in Europe, would raise, and I'm sure in other
                        countries, elsewhere, in Latin America, that the AFL, AFL-CIO subsequently
                        and the CIO itself were accused of being agents of the State Department,
                        agents of American foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. There have been those accusations. And yet, it reflects
                    ideological blinkers or naivete in not understanding both the personalities and
                    the institutional independence which were represented in the labor movement. It
                    is impossible for anyone with an understanding of the way the American Trade
                    Union movement functions to imagine that over time the AFL-CIO, first the AFL
                    and then the AFL-CIO, would adapt their attitudes in order to accommodate the
                    government on a continuing, broad range of issues. There was cooperation
                    certainly. There was close cooperation, but there was close cooperation because
                    there was an identity of interests and of policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>There never was control because the trade union would not permit itself to be
                    controlled. Irving Brown, as the European representative of the AFL, and then of
                    the AFL-CIO, had one boss, and that was his headquarters back home. He would
                    never have permitted himself, nor would the headquarters have permitted him, to
                    subordinate his activities or his interests or his attitudes to that of the
                    American Government, if there were divergent views.</p>
                <p>Franco's Spain is a good example of divergent views, in which it would have been
                    futile for the American Government, which for reasons of broader strategic
                    interests continued to support Franco, whereas the American trade unions refused
                    to have anything to do with the labor organizations organized by Franco. It
                    would have been futile for the American Government to have felt it could further
                    its strategic interest by trying to force the American trade union movement to
                    take a different view. It tried in fact at some stages in later years, but
                    without success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall on what kinds of issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. The issue of when the American Government, in its general
                    strategic attitude toward Franco, financed leader grants to the United States
                    for labor organization representatives from Spain. The American government
                    representatives here tried very hard to get American labor officials to see
                    these people. They never succeeded. The American trade union would not see any
                    of them, because they were regarded as nothing more than the controlled
                    representatives of Franco and not of independent trade unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as you know, did the American trade union movement,
                        financially or otherwise, assist the underground labor movements that were
                        developing in Spain at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: I just have no information about that. I don't know. What's more, I
                    don't have the impression that there was terribly much going on in that regard
                    in those years. The crumbling of the Franco structure was a gradual one, and the
                    efforts of the old trade unionists who had their headquarters outside Spain, in
                    southern France, to influence things in Spain had some importance but did not
                    play the same vital role as did the internal forces which were developing in
                    Spain.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Switching to another subject, yet one that affected the

                        had the issue of McCarthyism and Labor Attach�s were especially vulnerable
                        and accused, or in my own experience without foundation, but nevertheless
                        they were accused of being susceptible [and were] the targets of some of the
                        investigations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: That's an interesting kind of problem and experience which we all went
                    through in that period. Let me personalize it in this regard. This took place,
                    of course, after my return [to Washington, D.C.] to the Department [of State],
                    and I was then Labor Advisor to the European Bureau. Within the Bureau, because
                    of the kinds of things we have been talking about, within the Bureau labor was
                    regarded as a vital element in the defense of democracy in Western Europe. And
                    so the Labor Advisor didn't have to sell very hard the importance of his
                    function.</p>
                <p>My office was next door to the Assistant Secretary. I attended the daily staff
                    meetings of the Assistant Secretary with a few of his senior people, the heads
                    of the divisions. There was a close relationship, because it was simply assumed
                    that [labor] was important. Along came McCarthy. In the European Bureau, as far
                    as the Bureau itself was concerned, the atmosphere was more sophisticated than
                    in most places because Livingston Merchant, who was then Assistant Secretary,
                    later Ambassador to Canada, very clearly reflected in these daily meetings
                    contempt for the whole McCarthy process. Half of our time was spent meeting with
                    Special Agents and giving background about individuals or opinions about people,
                    and it was perfectly clear that these agents knew little about the nuances of
                    political differentiation on the left. In many cases they just didn't understand
                    that Socialists weren't Communists. And so one had to grope with this
                    “know-nothingness,” and yet it was made at least palatable to some degree by
                    virtue of the fact that in the Bureau the atmosphere was one of contempt all
                    around from the top down.</p>
                <p>Now, as far as the Administration at this point [was concerned], Scott McLeod had
                    been named Under Secretary for Administration by the Eisenhower Administration.
                    This was during the McCarthy period. Scott McLeod had been Chief of Staff for
                    Vermont Senator Styles Bridges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very conservative senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: An extraordinarily conservative fellow. Anyhow, Scott McLeod was
                    different from McCarthy because McCarthy was a demagogue. He didn't really
                    particularly believe in what he was saying. He just did it for political effect,
                    whereas Scott McLeod was a true believer. He believed all this stuff.</p>
                <p>Now I happened, through a combination of accidental circumstances, to get to know
                    Scott McLeod very well. It resulted from the following: As Labor Advisor to the
                    European Bureau, I had been aware of the position taken by The Netherlands and
                    Italy in the NATO meetings about the importance of increasing the amount of
                    emigration out of their countries into the United States because of the huge
                    unemployment problems they had. And I had written a memorandum before the end of
                    the Truman Administration in 1952 to the Assistant Secretary to be sent to the
                    White House recommending that legislation be enacted to permit special visa
                    quotas for these two countries. The memorandum was accepted in the White House
                    and was recommended to Congress, but nothing happened to it in Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So when the Eisenhower Administration came into office, I started the process
                    again because the same pressures were mounting in Europe, particularly from
                    Italy. I wrote another memorandum addressed to the Assistant Secretary to be
                    forward to the White House. The Assistant Secretary forwarded the recommendation
                    to the White House. Maxwell Rabb was Special Assistant to the President in
                    charge of minority problems, and to him this idea struck a chord, because he
                    felt this was a way of getting Italian support for Eisenhower, so he recommended
                    in the White House that it be sent to Congress. Eisenhower was still in that
                    early period of his administration when he thought that a President should not
                    get involved in the legislative process. The President could make
                    recommendations, but it was Congress's function to legislate.</p>
                <p>Well, nothing happened with his recommendation, and Congressmen who did have an
                    interest said, “Let's have some specific program, a text of a bill sent from the
                    White House, so we know what you want in more detail.” Finally that took hold,
                    and so I was named chairman of an interdepartmental executive committee to
                    develop legislation that could be sent to Congress. On this committee we had
                    represented the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and other
                    departments, but also within the Department [of State], we had the Visa
                    Division, and we had Congressional Relations, and Scott McLeod for security. And
                    it was in this context that I got to know Scott McLeod quite well, so that when
                    he turned his attention, quite inevitably, toward Labor Attach�s. . . Who are
                    these strange characters? Fortunately by that time he didn't regard me as a
                    subversive and thought he could trust me. And so to a certain extent, I think, I
                    was able to influence McLeod and educate McLeod enough that he accepted the
                    basic notion that the fact that someone was a labor specialist didn't
                    automatically make him suspect with regard to security. That, however, did not
                    prevent, of course, a number of Labor Attach�s from facing security problems of
                    one sort or another, many of them frivolous, but nonetheless disconcerting from
                    a career point of view. But it was a rather interesting, strange kind of
                    combination.</p>
                <p>By the way, what happened with that bill which we finally developed was that it
                    was sent by Eisenhower to Congress with a recommendation for action. In the
                    negotiations with Congress, the White House made more compromises than I would
                    have liked, but Congress did enact legislation within the year. This became the
                    Refugee Relief Act, and it had so many restrictive security provisions in it
                    that no one ever got a visa. But the attitude of supporters of the program was,
                    and they were right, let's get the bill through. If it doesn't work, we'll get
                    it modified, and that's what happened. They got no visas under the first version
                    of this legislation because the security provisions were impossible to meet. And
                    so after a year they modified the security provisions.</p>

                        point, this was after I'd come back from Australia, I had known the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Dennis, when he came back, was assigned as the deputy
                        to Scott McLeod for security clearances. And at that time you may recall
                        there was an Assistant Secretary of Labor whom the Eisenhower Administration
                        was trying to get rid of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Wilkens?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not Wilkens, the previous one. The follow from New Jersey,
                        who had been a road commissioner and friend of Bernie Weisman's, who was. .
                        . . Anyways, who didn't want to leave quietly, and he laid down an
                        accusation that all the Labor Attach�s were Communists, or they were a nest
                        of Communists. Dennis Flinn, fortunately, had done some. . . He and I had
                        worked rather closely together, I as Labor Attach� in Sydney, he as
                        political officer, who did some labor work and with whom I had a regular
                        relationship. And so when these lists of Labor Attach�s and accusations
                        about them came through, he and I would talk them over. He knew that a lot
                        of these things were just flimsy charges, and besides not even reasonable
                        charges, having been exposed to the labor scene and the labor attach�s'
                        work. So as a result, as we talked about each case, one at a time, and we
                        had some very important cases which involved labor attach�s who later turned
                        out to be invaluable in key posts when we needed them most, I'm thinking
                        particularly of Ed Ballin at one point, we didn't lose a body among the
                        Labor Attach� Corps. But looking on it, there were some very, very close
                        calls. And I suppose the exposure of Scott McLeod on his level to something
                        having to do with labor and the exposure of Dennis on his level turned out
                        to be sort of the dirty secret of how the Labor Attach� Program ended up
                        unscathed by the security pressures on it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Yes. I think that's right in many respects. Dennis Flinn was a more
                    sophisticated person, conservative but sophisticated person, than Scott McLeod.
                    As I say, Scott McLeod was a true believer, and it's only as we got to know each
                    other well and we saw each other socially with wives that he began to realize
                    that perhaps life was more complicated than the straightforward, black and white
                    Styles Bridges had taught him to see.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to back track a bit. This goes back to the first
                        tape, but I think it's an important point. During the early formation of the
                        free trade unions in Western Europe and the support for them, particularly
                        in the case of Germany, we also had a case in Japan, the idea that the
                        American government as a foreign policy would foster the building of free
                        trade unions was, the instruments of that policy or the agents you might
                        say, or to a large degree in any way those who were deeply involved were the
                        military people, the generals. Eisenhower was a particular friend very close
                        to. . . Irving Brown got to know Eisenhower very well. The Japanese
                        constitution had this clause in it about trade unions and fostering them.
                        Clay in Germany, I think, dealt closely with Lou Wiesner. But anyways, how
                        did it strike you in Washington at that time that here is the military, the
                        people you would least expect to be favorable to labor, turning out to be
                        very, very friendly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, I would say to a certain extent the fact that it was the Cold
                    Warperiod. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But turning out to be a benefactor of labor programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: . . . distorted the question of “Are they pro-labor or against labor?”
                    None of these people necessarily cared a hoot about labor. What they recognized,
                    and they recognized it not because they were military people, but because they
                    were close to the developments of the countries in which they were assigned, or
                    in the case of Eisenhower because of his general relationships, they were close
                    enough to, and realistic enough, to see the relationships between society's
                    stability and the nature of the trade union, and that the nature of the trade
                    union movement could easily determine the fate of the country they were
                    concerned [about]. So that one got judgments of that sort made realistically by
                    senior military people, who I suppose they were senior because they were bright
                    to begin with, and they were realistic. What's more, in every case they had
                    advisors. They were thick with advisors, and these advisors counted for a great
                    deal because if one looks, let's say, to Clay in Germany, the vital area in
                    middle Europe, Bob Murphy was his political advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Identify Bob Murphy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Bob Murphy was a career Foreign Service Officer who worked his way up
                    from clerk to the senior position at that time, carrying the rank of ambassador
                    as senior political representative to Clay, the Allied Military Government, and
                    headed the American diplomatic mission in Germany. He later became Deputy Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs, the most senior career position in the State
                    Department, a very bright, sophisticated, down-to-earth person who had
                    represented Eisenhower in negotiations during the war in North Africa with
                    respect to the whole question of who among the French would govern. In any
                    event, Murphy was a sophisticated fellow, who understood all these problems, and
                    of course with people like Lou Wiesner working closely with Murphy, this meant a
                    great deal in terms of the education of these military people. You want me to
                    stop.</p>
                <p>Just to wind up on the years when I was Labor Advisor in EUR [European Bureau,
                    Department of State], one of the remnants of my leave of absence and research in
                    Italy, of course, was the fact that it was known in EUR that my position with
                    respect to the Italian labor policy differed from that of the official policy
                    still in effect at the time. It raised no general major problems for me in the
                    Bureau. It did raise, of course, problems of relationships, or rather of point
                    of view with respect to the Italian desk officers and the West European division
                    headed, by then, Homer Byington, and the Assistant Secretary, knowing of these
                    differences, tried to have us work out our problems by direct conversation and
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>It didn't work very well in that regard. The situation, however, didn't remain a
                    terribly difficult one because gradually it became perfectly clear that the then
                    official policy of the Government, attempting to destroy the UIL and to bolster
                    the efforts of CISL to become the sole anti-Communist trade union organization
                    competing against the Communists, simply failed. UIL continued to exist,
                    continued to grow, continued to operate. Eventually a review of American policy
                    was required simply by the movement of events, and eventually the policy, which
                    I had urged in my memorandum of 1950, became official policy both for the
                    Government as well as for the AFL, which went through the same process as did
                    the government with respect to the change circumstances. In any event, this
                    played no large role with respect to my relationships in EUR, and as I've said,
                    by and large because of the enormous importance of labor in those years for the
                    future of Western Europe and the competition with the Soviet Union, with respect
                    to internal stability and development through the Marshall Plan and other
                    efforts, labor was given a star role in all of these events, and as a result my
                    own situation with respect to advising in the European Bureau was a welcome one
                    and did, in fact, play an important role.</p>
                <p>So much for the EUR period. Unless you have any further questions, let me move on
                    to my assignment in France in 1956. I should say that for about a year, ten
                    months in 1954 and 1955, I again was on leave of absence, spending most of it in
                    Italy, part of it at Harvard in Cambridge, and continued my research for the
                    book that eventually was written and published, so that I didn't have a
                    continuous period from 1951 to 1956, but had this interrupted by the 10 months
                    of leave. In any event, by late 1955 it had been decided that I would be
                    assigned to Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I succeeded Dick Eldridge, who had been Labor Attach� at the Embassy in Paris
                    from 1944 until his transfer in 1955, more than eleven years. Let me take just a
                    moment to talk about Dick Eldridge. I think he deserves some underscoring as one
                    of the bright stars in the early period of the Labor Attach� Program. Eldridge
                    had known France intimately over half a lifetime by the time he became Labor
                    Attach�. He had been a volunteer in the French Army in the First World War and
                    had served in France for the International Chamber of Commerce for a number of
                    years. During the period when he was Labor Attach� he was intimately associated
                    with the whole range of trade union, employer association, government, and
                    political people. Eldridge was regarded in France as an intimate associate of
                    all those interested in the political-labor situation and was accepted as such
                    by the French. His relations on the American side were extremely good; he was
                    highly respected by American officials in the Embassy, the State Department in
                    Washington, and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>He had one ideosyncrasy, which perhaps might be called a limitation and yet
                    didn't limit his influence, and that was that he hated to write reports, and he
                    wrote very little. Part of this was an inhibition against writing; part of it
                    was that he did not trust the distribution system and felt the kind of analysis
                    which he usually embarked on would end up with a lot of people who knew nothing
                    about the French situation and would misuse the information. One of his favorite
                    methods of reporting was to tear a restaurant menu in half, use the half as a
                    post card and scribble comments and insights on the French situation [and send
                    it] in the open mails which he felt were safer frequently than the classified
                    documents. He was well regarded throughout government. A few people, perhaps
                    more interested in form than substance, more concerned with having the reporting
                    requirements fulfilled than the insight and influence which grew out of
                    Eldridge's relationships, were critical, but they were few and had little
                    influence.</p>
                <p>In any event, my coming to Paris to replace Eldridge represented an interesting
                    challenge but a rather different one from what had been frequently the case for
                    Labor Attach�s assigned in a new post; that is, the Embassy and the State
                    Department recognized labor as a vital and fundamental influence on the
                    stability of the country. Trying to step into Eldridge's shoes was a
                    considerable challenge, but at least it didn't represent the necessity of
                    convincing people that labor was important. In any event, I went about
                    developing my associations on the French scene, trade union, employer
                    association, political, government, and journalists. The latter were useful,
                    from the Agence France Press and some of the important newspapers from Le Monde
                    to others. They were worth cultivating as they followed the labor-political
                    scene intimately and were quite knowledgeable.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>In any event, over time my associations were wide and close, and the test of the
                    role that a Labor Attach� can play came dramatically, when in 1958 the French
                    military in Algeria rose up against the French Government. The Government was
                    faced with a rebellion in which de Gaulle eventually came back to power. The
                    background, of course, was that the French had been attempting to hang on in
                    Algeria for years in a military situation where the Algerian nationalists had
                    been attempting to fight free, and increasingly frustrated by the march of
                    events, the military finally revolted. May 13, 1958, then became the crucial
                    date, the date of the uprising, and during the following approximately two
                    weeks, there was utter chaos in the country. Keeping up with events, attempting
                    to report on developments, to analyze what was happening then became a difficult
                    task, because the normal channels were closed for normal operation of government
                    and the political parties. It turned out that the only people in the Embassy who
                    had the kinds of contacts that were meaningful in this situation were myself and
                    one of the young political officers, who had intimate contacts with various
                    political party people. In any event, this period was a rather dramatic one, not
                    only for France, but personally for me in that it meant a lot of chasing about,
                    little sleep, reporting all hours of the night. It became rather dramatic with
                    time that there was no way that the government could gain control of a situation
                    that was rapidly running out of the normal channels of administration, so much
                    so that when de Gaulle announced his availability for return to power, and that
                    he would be the only one who could save the situation for France, there was
                    little that the political parties felt they could do to prevent this.</p>
                <p>The one dramatic gesture which was attempted by the Communist CGT was to announce
                    that they would call a general strike throughout the country in order to defend
                    democracy and prevent de Gaulle from coming to power. They made this conditional
                    on the agreement of Force Ouvriere, the Independent Social Democratic Trade
                    Union, and of the Christian Democratic Trade Union, CFTC. It was during that
                    dramatic weekend when the political parties, feeling they could do little to
                    overcome the situation, and the Socialist Party executive committee met during
                    the evening of Saturday to urge that Force Ouvriere go along with the request of
                    the CGT to call the general strike. It turned out that Force Ouvriere played the
                    crucial role of holding the line against the Communist assumption of leadership.
                    The CFTC had decided that it would do, whatever the Force Ouvriere decided to
                    do: It would follow along in the general strike if the Force Ouvriere did; it
                    would oppose it, if Force Ouvriere opposed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The Force Ouvriere Executive Bureau met during the night of Saturday to Sunday
                    and Robert Bothereau, who was then the General Secretary, took the position and
                    succeeded in convincing his executive to go along with him, to oppose the
                    general strike. His position was that if a general strike was called, the
                    Communist Party, the CGT and the Communists through them, would then become
                    again the group which would claim to have defended democracy, and that since the
                    workers had no arms, the situation would turn into a Spanish civil war
                    telescoped into 24 hours in that the military first would intervene, and the
                    workers would be overcome with a great deal of violence. Again, the Communists
                    would be able to play the heroes, but the result would be not that de Gaulle
                    would come to power, but the most reactionary and anti-democratic military
                    officials would, in fact, take power, destroying the trade unions as well as
                    democratic institutions.</p>
                <p>Bothereau, who had had the reputation, and had been criticized by some Americans,
                    of being too mild-mannered, too introspective to be effective as a leader
                    against the Communists, turned out that night to contradict all of the
                    generalizations that had been made about him. In any event, once the Force
                    Ouvriere decided not to go along with the general strike, to oppose it, the CFTC
                    going along with them, the CGT, the Communists, were forced to pull in their
                    horns, cancel the general strike call, and simply have a demonstration strike of
                    24 hours in industry. De Gaulle did come to power, of course, with the approval
                    in Parliament of the traditional political parties who felt they had no
                    alternative but to go along.</p>
                <p>What was interesting is that there is little reference when this period is
                    discussed by historians to the crucial potential role which this call for a
                    general strike might have played and would have played had Force Ouvriere not
                    played the role it did. At the time, however, it was recognized for what it was,
                    and again labor dramatically became a crucial element in at least not saving the
                    pre-existing democratic institutions, but keeping the situation sufficiently
                    within control to have a transfer of power to de Gaulle within at least the
                    formal institutions of pre-existing government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, did Irving Brown play a role in these events, and can
                        you describe what his relationships might have been with Bothereau at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, yes. Irving Brown, as I discussed earlier, had been very much in
                    contact with the anti-Communists in the French trade union scene, during the
                    famous effort of the Communists in the winter of 1947 to 1948 to destroy the
                    French economy and prevent it from recovering through their general strike.
                    During that period when those who were opposed to the Communists left and
                    organized Force Ouvriere, Irving Brown was very much involved with these people
                    whom he had known quite well in the previous year or two, working at that time
                    within the CGT. He continued, of course, to have important relations with the
                    Force Ouvriere people throughout the succeeding period. That he played a
                    particular role that night, no. This was Force Ouvriere alone. This was
                    Bothereau alone, and the decisions made were not influenced particularly by
                    outside elements. They were determined by the Force Ouvriere trade union
                    officials.</p>
                <p>What was interesting and useful was that having, as I had by that time, free
                    access through long-time association with trade union leaders in the Force
                    Ouvriere, I could call and did call Bothereau at 12 at night or two in the
                    morning and discuss whatever developments were on the horizon at the time. It
                    should be kept in mind that when this crisis started on May 13, the political
                    parties realized that they were in a situation in which they could no longer
                    function as they normally did. What was required because of the expectation that
                    dramatic developments might call for a drastic response (the landing of the
                    insurgents on the mainland was feared), what was required they felt was that
                    there be contact throughout the country with the masses of people, and the
                    political parties could not serve that function. Only the Communist Party had
                    that kind of structure. What did exist, however, were the trade unions, and here
                    the Socialist Party, in agreement with other parties, called on Force Ouvriere
                    to use its machinery, its structure, to keep in intimate contact with the people
                    throughout the country, and it did this by calling out Force Ouvriere to turn
                    its offices into a 24-hour alert system. All Force Ouvriere offices throughout
                    the country, all local unions, all regional unions, all provincial unions, went
                    on a 24-hour alert. They were the means through which communication could be
                    effected from the center to the country, from Paris throughout the provinces. It
                    dramatized the fact that the machinery of the trade union movement is uniquely
                    structured to serve the kind of political function which normally is not
                    required in a democratic country but which fit the requirements of that
                    emergency situation.</p>
                <p>After the advent of de Gaulle to power in May of 1958, there were no dramatic
                    changes on the labor scene for the next following years in that the same kind of
                    competition which existed before continued. De Gaulle did turn things around in
                    Algeria in the sense that he did eventually give Algeria independence, and while
                    it was a slow and painful process for France, nonetheless it was achieved within
                    three years.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>As far as my own assignment was concerned, in the period immediately before my
                    transfer in 1960, I was slated to go to the National War College. This
                    assignment was changed when it was urged on me that instead, I accept an
                    assignment to India, where it was felt the situation was tense as a result of
                    the policies of the Nehru Government in playing a third-world role of neutrality
                    leaning toward the Soviet Union. The trade union picture in India became
                    terribly important as the independent trade unions, the trade unions independent
                    of the Congress Party, mainly Socialist unions — the Hind Mazdoor Sabha trade
                    union organization (HMS) — could play a crucial role in whether or not the
                    general political scene swung more definitely in the direction of the Soviet
                    Union. The Hind Mazdoor Sabha, being a Socialist-oriented trade union
                    organization and very much a minority, nonetheless had a very vital importance,
                    because its principal strength was in the transportation field — the
                    longshoremen, stevedores, railroad unions — and it counted for a great deal as a
                    result.</p>
                <p>In any event, I agreed to go to India and did go there toward the end of 1960.
                    For me, India was a fascinating assignment in that it was the first time that I
                    served in what could genuinely be called a completely different culture. I
                    traveled a good deal around in the country, made associations with trade union
                    people and political people around in different parts of India.</p>
                <p>With respect to the HMS union and the concern with its general orientation, the
                    head of the organization was a member of Parliament from Hyderabad, Mahadeov
                    Singh, and so he spent a good deal of time in Delhi. In any event, we got to
                    know each other quite well. Singh liked to discuss ideological questions and
                    general political orientation questions, and we did at great length to a point
                    where I saw him often enough that one of his colleagues, who was generally
                    Western oriented, once in a conversation with me said, “Look, it is hopeless. I
                    know what you're trying to do with Singh. You're not going to succeed because
                    with Singh it is not a question really of ideology. It is a question of color.”
                    Well, it turned out actually that this was something of an exaggeration, because
                    with time Singh's general orientation was modified enough that he did in general
                    begin to favor a Western orientation.</p>
                <p>One of the things which had an influence on him was a trip to the United States.
                    I had, after some time, suggested to him that he consider a leader grant to
                    visit the United States. I was in Bombay on a trip at about that time, and Singh
                    came through Bombay. We met in my hotel room and discussed the possibility of a
                    leader grant. He had considered it, and he was prepared to accept, but he said,
                    “Look, the only shoes I own are these sandals I'm wearing. I don't own any
                    ordinary shoes. How can I go to the United States without any shoes?” I leaned
                    over, took my shoes off and handed him my shoes. He made the trip, which turned
                    out to be a very good one from the point of view of his exposure to the United
                    States and meetings with trade union people and others. He came back quite
                    impressed, and it had some long-time influence on him.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The principal trade union organization, the Indian National Trade Union Congress
                    (INTUC), was Congress Party controlled and oriented, and the Congress Party, of
                    course, reflected the policies and positions of Nehru and his government. By and
                    large the policy was neutralist. The relationship between the trade union
                    movement and the government was a close one, but one in which the direction of
                    things generally ran from government to party, or from party to government, and
                    to the trade union rather than in general the reverse. The HMS played a more
                    independent role, and in this regard did have greater independent influence.</p>
                <p>Because of the very different cultural background that characterized India, I
                    volunteered to stay an extra year. . . — At that time the assignments were two
                    years. — . . .an extra year in order to maximize any benefits that would come
                    from my associations. Nonetheless, again, the National War College possibility
                    raised its head, and Foreign Service Personnel decided that I had better go to
                    the National War College that year, the fall of 1962. As it turned out, when I
                    got to Washington in August of 1962, I was told in Personnel that I was no
                    longer scheduled at the War College. This was rather startling to me, because I
                    had had an assignment to the War College washed out three times in the past. The
                    first time had been in 1948, when I was in ILH, and in 1948 the personnel office
                    had slated me for the National War College until they looked at my age and
                    decided I was too young at that time to go, and so I was told, “No, you'll be
                    recommended some years from now.” 1953 was the second time that I was
                    recommended by Personnel to the National War College. This time, at the time I
                    was Labor Advisor in EUR, and without consulting me the Executive Director of
                    EUR notified Personnel that I simply could not be spared from the Bureau, and
                    therefore my name should be scratched from the list. I didn't learn this until
                    some years later. The third time was, of course, in Paris as I mentioned, when
                    my assignment was scratched in order for me to go to India.</p>
                <p>In any event, when I got to Washington in 1962 and was told that I was no longer
                    slated to go to the National War College, I was quite angry and upset and tried
                    to track down what had happened. I couldn't get any answers until I finally got
                    to the Under Secretary for Management, and he explained to me that this was a
                    decision that had not been taken in the State Department, that the State
                    Department had no control over it, that it was a White House decision, and we'd
                    better abide by it. It turned out on investigation that the decision had been
                    made in a conversation between George Meany, then head of the AFL-CIO and
                    President Kennedy.</p>
                <p>The background was that in 1961 with the Kennedy Administration taking office, a
                    new position was set up in the State Department, Special Assistant to the
                    Secretary for International Labor Affairs, and the person named to the job was
                    the former head of the State, County and Municipal Workers Union. He didn't. . .
                    Q: Chapman?</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Chapman, that's right. Apparently he did not fit in well and was a
                    disappointment. So he left, and the question was: Who would be assigned? The
                    State Department, knowing that Meany was coming in to see Kennedy and knowing
                    the subject that was going to be discussed, recommended to the White House that
                    President Kennedy take the initiative and suggest a name, my name, as the
                    successor to Chapman. Kennedy, who didn't know me from Adam, nonetheless
                    accepted this recommendation, made it to Meany, and Meany said, “Fine, I'll take
                    it.” The result was that an agreement [was made] between Meany and Kennedy that
                    I would become “S/IL,” as it was called, Special Assistant to the Secretary [for
                    International Labor Affairs]. No one in the State Department was prepared to try
                    to upset it.</p>
                <p>Well, having been prevented three times before from going to the National War
                    College and finding myself again in that situation, and it seemed to me this was
                    the last time I would have an opportunity to go, I was more upset about having
                    my assignment to the War College washed out than thinking kindly of the kind of
                    the assignment which had been offered as an alternative. And so I set about
                    trying to upset the decision. No one in State, of course, would get involved,
                    and so I consulted with Michael Ross, who was then head of the International
                    Department of the AFL-CIO, whom I knew quite well, explained my own situation to
                    him, my reasons for not wanting to take S/IL at that time, and he agreed. He
                    went to Meany and he said , “Look, this is going to interfere with Horowitz's
                    career interests. Let's wash out this agreement you made.” Meany agreed, and
                    Ross went to the White House, got it washed out, and I did go to the National
                    War College. The irony is that nine years later I, in fact, did take the
                    position of S/IL.</p>
                <p>Well, I spent the next number of years after the War College on non-labor
                    assignments. I was Political Counselor in the Hague, where I was Acting Deputy
                    Chief of Mission for much of the time there; I went to the University of Kansas
                    as a diplomat-in-residence, at the time an experimental program, which has
                    developed since then into a regular feature of assignment of senior Foreign
                    Service Officers to universities; I became first a faculty member and then
                    coordinator of the National Interdepartmental Seminar, which was the so-called
                    “counter insurgency course” developed by the Kennedys, particularly Robert
                    Kennedy and required of all senior officers assigned to Third World Countries
                    from any of the foreign affairs agencies. And finally in the Foreign Service
                    Institute I was made Dean for Academic Relations in supervising the assignment
                    of officers to universities in various capacities, generally for study. While on
                    that last assignment as Dean for Academic Relations, in 1971, I was called in by
                    the Deputy Under Secretary for Management, Bill Macomber, and offered the
                    assignment, which I had turned down in 1962, of Special Assistant to the
                    Secretary for International Labor Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>In 1962 after I had succeeded in avoiding the assignment [as S/IL], the position,
                    after a gap of some months, was filled by Philip Delaney, who came out of the
                    AFL, and he remained on that job for some years. Macomber, in attempting to
                    interest me in the assignment, suggested that the experience with people from
                    the trade union movement assigned to the job had not been an all together happy
                    one, that they wanted to have the Labor Attach� Program better integrated into
                    the general Foreign Service, that the job of Special Assistant could be done
                    best by someone who came out of the Foreign Service, and that the original
                    motivation for creating the position in 1961 had been the recognition of the
                    need for coordinating the various activities in the labor field by the labor
                    attach�s, by the labor advisors in the geographic bureaus, and having top level
                    input with respect to general policy matters if labor played any kind of role in
                    its impact on those policies. I'd been away from the labor field for a number of
                    years, and I felt that if I came back, it would have to be with the support of
                    the Department to build the program on a genuinely career basis, and have the
                    support of the Department to recognize it as belonging within the Foreign
                    Service as an integral part of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>At the time that I was offered the position of S/IL, there was a study in the
                    Department by a group headed by Bill Cargo, who was head of State's policy
                    planning. Cargo had been named head of this group to survey and make
                    recommendations with respect to the future Labor Attach� Program. This had
                    resulted from conversations between the American trade movement leadership and
                    people in the White House at the time. The Cargo Report, and I don't remember
                    now whether it came out just after my appointment or just before my appointment
                    at S/IL, contained many elements which I had tried to insist had to be
                    undertaken by the State Department, if I were to take the position as S/IL. What
                    I urged on Macomber was that if the Labor Attach� Program were to be regarded
                    within the Service as an integral part of the Service, then certain things had
                    to be done. First, many of the positions in the field had to be reviewed and
                    their general classification raised, so that there would be more senior
                    positions for Labor Attach�s. Secondly, there should be a greater number of
                    promotions from within the Labor Attach� service, so that the specialty would be
                    regarded as a desirable one within the Service. This was against the background
                    of the fact that because of budgetary considerations and perhaps other
                    considerations, it was perfectly clear that in the future positions in the Labor
                    Attach� specialty would largely be filled from within the Service rather than
                    from outside, and that therefore it was necessary to attract and keep career
                    Foreign Service Officers into this specialty, so that promotions became one of
                    the key elements of course. Another was that a special additional training
                    program be set up, so that Labor Attach�s named from within the Service would
                    have the kind of training necessary for them to do the job effectively. And
                    finally, that the number of Labor Attach� positions be expanded in the
                    Embassies, and that a number of Assistant Labor Attach� positions be named in
                    addition to the one or two that existed at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Macomber agreed to all this, and on that basis I accepted the position of S/IL. I
                    should say that the Cargo Report, and as I remember. . . — I don't remember
                    whether it came just before or after my assignment. — . . . contained most of
                    the same elements that I had discussed with Macomber with all the affirmative
                    recommendations that were part of what Macomber had accepted. In any event, I
                    found that the administrative side of the Department, led by Macomber and by
                    Bill Hall, who was the Director General of the Foreign Service, came through on
                    the commitments which had been made to me. The fact is that Bill Hall, before
                    becoming Director General, had headed a committee to downgrade positions in the
                    embassies to make them available to more junior officers. He later complained to
                    me, that at the same time that he was doing this, he was reclassifying labor
                    positions by raising them, doing exactly the opposite of what he was doing
                    generally in the Service, but this was a commitment that was made, and they were
                    living up to it. The same was true after a while with promotions. At the
                    following round of promotions, Hall called me in and said that he wanted me to
                    agree to something which was rather unusual, and that in the statistical results
                    of the promotions, instead of breaking out the labor attach� group as a separate
                    group, that they be included within the political category and not identified,
                    because there were so many promotions among Labor Attach�s that many in the rest
                    of the Service would complain, and that by folding them into the general
                    political classification, they would not be identified as much and made the
                    object of criticism. To a surprising extent the commitments were kept. There was
                    an increase in number of Labor Attach� positions as well, and as S/IL, I found
                    that the Department by and large did recognize the place labor merited in the
                    formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>I should say that at the time of my appointment to S/IL, at the time of my
                    discussions with Macomber, his point about not having someone out of the trade
                    union movement and having someone from the career service resulted in my
                    commenting that while that might be desirable, it was certainly going to be
                    impossible for anyone to function on that job without having the confidence of
                    the trade union movement. I urged that the trade union movement not be asked
                    whether they would approve of my appointment, but that since I knew that Bill
                    Rogers, then Secretary of State, played golf occasionally with George Meany, who
                    was still then head of the AFL-CIO, that the next time they played golf, Rogers
                    should tell Meany that he was planning to appoint me, and that if Meany had any
                    kind of negative reaction, Rogers would certainly hear it without having to ask
                    whether he approved of my appointment. That was done, and Meany's reaction was a
                    favorable one, so there wasn't any problem on that score. In functioning as
                    S/IL, I attended the Secretary's daily staff meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Dr. Daniel L.
                        Horowitz, first Labor Attach� in the Foreign Service, who continues his
                        recounting of his period of tenure as the head of S/IL.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: I had regular weekly meetings with all the geographic Labor Advisors in
                    the State Department for purpose of coordination, and in addition to the
                    position of S/IL, Special Assistant to the Secretary, I had also been named, as
                    had Phil Delaney, my predecessor, as head of the International Labor Office
                    within AID [Agency for International Development]. So that in addition to being
                    the senior official in State Department for labor matters, I was also the senior
                    official in AID for labor matters, automatically then providing for a kind of
                    coordination which had increasingly become necessary as the programs of AID
                    continued alongside the diplomatic institutions of State. This meant that a
                    considerable amount of my time and energy was devoted toward the AID labor
                    matters, which in turn reflected the increasing importance for AID of the trade
                    union labor institutes which operated in East Asia, in South Asia, Middle East
                    and Africa as well as Latin America.</p>
                <p>By and large, the relationships which were necessary for coordination purposes
                    within AID were achieved through staff assignments, in that I had a significant
                    staff within the Labor Division of AID, and also with my direct access and
                    regular meetings with the head of AID and his deputies. As far as the
                    relationship with the AFL-CIO was concerned, this was more complex for obvious
                    reasons. On the one hand, my own relationships within the AFL-CIO were on a
                    regular continuing basis with, however, the proviso that for general foreign
                    policy matters, it made no sense for the head of the AFL-CIO to channel his
                    views exclusively through me, since he had direct access and wanted to continue
                    to have direct access to the Secretary of State. This, in fact, represented no
                    special problems, because this was understood all around to be the part of the
                    necessary relationships of a political nature which existed between the AFL-CIO,
                    Secretary of State and with officials in the White House. But it did leave a
                    huge area of coordination and relationship to be achieved with the trade union
                    movement by S/IL.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I might mention one rather disturbing episode toward the latter part of my tenure
                    in S/IL when in a telephone call from the then Under Secretary of Labor it was
                    suggested to me that the Special Assistant to a prominent senator wanted very
                    badly to be named Labor Attach� in London, and that this was being supported by
                    the Under Secretary of Labor. My own reaction was thoroughly negative, saying
                    that this couldn't possibly take place, that I would oppose it, that if this
                    chap had any abilities, we might consider him if a position from outside was
                    open, for one of the junior positions to have him tested out, but that was as
                    far as I could go. I knew that the follow-up to my conversation [resulting from]
                    my response to the Under Secretary of Labor would be that he would immediately
                    telephone either or both the Deputy Under Secretary for Management or the Under
                    Secretary of State, and so I immediately got in touch with the Deputy Under
                    Secretary for Management, Bill Macomber, told him of my conversation, urged that
                    he respond in the same way that I did, and that, if any other response was made,
                    it would mean that all of the commitments which he had made to me to rebuild the
                    Labor Attach� Program on a career basis would be destroyed, that one couldn't
                    appoint from outside someone to a senior labor position without belying all the
                    commitments which had been made to build up a career service for Labor Attach�s.
                    Macomber agreed and agreed to take that position. I then went to the Under
                    Secretary of State, John Irwin, and reported my conversation with both the Under
                    Secretary of Labor and with Macomber, and Irwin in turn did agree as well to
                    take the same position. The result was that while the phone calls were placed to
                    the these people from the Labor Department, the response was the same as the one
                    I had given, and the situation was controlled in this fashion. This kind of
                    consideration, I suppose, of appointing someone to the top from outside as a
                    result of political pressures is one of the kinds of things which occurs from
                    time to time. Sometimes it can be resisted, sometimes not, but it would have
                    represented for the labor field at that time the destruction of all the
                    commitments that had been made to strengthen and rebuild a career service for
                    Labor Attach�s.</p>

                <p>Let me take a moment to discuss an issue that I know has been raised from time to
                    time, though not terribly seriously during that period, and that is why should
                    the Labor Attach� Program be within the control, be housed in the State
                    Department and run by the State Department with the outside advise of Labor
                    Department rather than placed within the Labor Department itself. Part of the
                    explanation is historical, because as I recounted in my experience in 1943, it
                    was the White House and the State Department which started the program because
                    of specifically political and diplomatic interests, and that Labor Department at
                    the time had little interest in the development. It was only later that it did
                    develop such interests, and while it was recognized early on that the Labor
                    Department had legitimate concern and interest in the program, nonetheless its
                    interest was in the nature of things somewhat more limited than that of other
                    types of specialist programs as the Commercial Attach� or the Minerals Attach�.
                    And the reason for that is that the initial impetus for the undertaking of labor
                    specialization and the focus of the program throughout its existence have
                    necessarily been on the political role of labor. By all means, the economic and
                    technical and statistical aspects of labor activity abroad are of interest, and
                    these are the kinds of interests which the Labor Department, of course, has
                    primacy in. What is of fundamental importance, however, for the formulation of
                    foreign policy, for affecting the political concerns of the State Department, in
                    which the Labor Department has little role to play simply in the nature of
                    division of responsibilities in government, the political focus of labor is a
                    primary concern to the State Department, and would always remain such.</p>
                <p>I don't recall now whether I mentioned it or not, but in 1953 and 1954, when I
                    was Labor Advisor to EUR, the Labor Department established a Trade Union
                    International Committee, and it had been agreed that because Labor Attach�s were
                    being appointed from outside, that the AFL and CIO, which were then separate,
                    would take turns nominating Labor Attach�s, and that the Labor Department would
                    automatically support anyone nominated by each of the organizations in turn. As
                    a pressure group, the Labor Department had obviously important influence on the
                    naming of Labor Attach�s, and in fact this system which was started by Labor
                    Department began to take effect in 1953 and 1954. Some of the people were good;
                    some were not. The labor movement, like any other organization, was not prepared
                    to give up its best people in order to appoint them outside its own organization
                    and sometimes simply named people as a way of getting rid of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>In any event, in EUR I was quite concerned with what might happen to the program
                    if we were subject to this kind of patronage, and when the pressures mounted
                    considerably to have appointments made as they were being made in other areas of
                    the world, I suggested to the then Assistant Secretary for Europe that if the
                    pressure mounted to a point where concessions had to be made in the quality of
                    Labor Attach�s, that, unfortunate as it might be, the State Department should
                    consider giving up the “Labor Attach�" title and letting the Labor Department
                    take control of those who would have the title of Labor Attach�s, and that the
                    State Department develop special political officers who would handle the
                    political aspects of labor, that our concern was sufficiently vital for the
                    political function that we had to have in State control of the type of people
                    and the quality of people who would be assigned to do the job. At the time,
                    Assistant Secretary of Europe, Livingston Merchant, agreed to this, but it never
                    came to a point where this issue was pressed, and we never had to face that
                    problem. In any event, the fact is that the Labor Attach� specialty is different
                    from that of Commercial Attach� or other types of attach�s.</p>
                <p>At the time that I was assigned to S/IL, I had told Macomber, Under Secretary for
                    Management, that I didn't want to have the assignment extended for more than two
                    years, and that after two years I'd like to go on to something else. As the two
                    years drew to a close in 1973, Macomber and Bill Hall, Director General,
                    suggested to me that they would like to recommend me for an ambassadorship in
                    Africa, and they had two or three posts in mind. While I was gratified at their
                    suggestion, my reaction was on the whole negative, in that the assignment I
                    really wanted was that of Consul General in Naples. I regarded that assignment
                    as more important than the ambassador jobs that were likely to be offered. I
                    knew Italy intimately. The book I'd written on the Italian labor movement had
                    been published by Harvard University Press, translated into Italian, and become
                    the standard text in universities in Italy. It was regarded in Italy as the
                    classic history of their labor movement. But I had never served in Italy. And so
                    when the Consul General in Naples, who had been on that assignment for a number
                    of years, retired in 1973, I urged that I would like to have that appointment
                    rather than an ambassadorship, a rather strange choice from career
                    considerations in that every Foreign Service Officer is supposed to aspire — the
                    baton in his knapsack — to an ambassadorship. But to me it made no sense in the
                    circumstances. In any event they agreed, and I was appointed Consul General in
                    Naples where I served for two years.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>At the end of those two years, I decided that I'd had enough of the Foreign
                    Service, that I wanted to do some writing, and so in the late spring of 1975, I
                    offered my resignation from the Foreign Service, retired, and came back to the
                    United States. Within a few months, however, because of special circumstances
                    that developed, I was drawn back into government. A crisis had developed in the
                    U.S. Government relationships with the ILO, the International Labor
                    Organization. The International Labor Organization, as part of the U.N. system,
                    was the only organization which had continuity from the time of the League of
                    Nations. It had developed over the long years of its existence based as it was
                    on a tripartite system of government, labor and management, had developed
                    international conventions of labor standards, which when adopted by countries
                    became part of international law as far as these countries were concerned.
                    Complicated procedures for due process had been developed to review standards of
                    labor in various countries, and the organization had a reputation which few
                    other international organizations had achieved, that of having developed a
                    reliable judicial process.</p>
                <p>The difficulty was that in the years of the 1960s and early 1970s more and more
                    the organization was used for political purposes in a combination between the
                    Soviet Union, Communist-oriented countries and Arab countries in an effort to
                    obtain a condemnation of activities, particularly in Israel, but in other areas
                    where political condemnation seemed desirable on their part. None of the due
                    process procedures were followed. Condemnations were made without regard to
                    substance or fact, and this increasingly developed into a situation in which the
                    United States felt it had no alternative but to regard this as a crisis. The
                    American trade union movement felt even stronger than the American Government
                    about the necessity of bringing the crisis to a head. So in the fall of 1975,
                    the American Government, following the constitutional requirement of the ILO,
                    gave notice to the organization that within two years it would withdraw from the
                    organization if the situation complained about was not corrected, and the
                    organization did not return to following its usual pattern of due process before
                    condemnation of countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>It was when the notice given to the ILO that I was asked to return to government
                    by being named by then President Ford to be the government representative to the
                    ILO. The notice of withdrawal had made clear that the United States did not want
                    to withdraw from the organization unless it was forced to do so, and it was
                    hoped that during these two years of notice it would be possible to turn the
                    organization around, and therefore make it possible to withdraw the intention of
                    canceling our membership to the ILO. John Dunlop, who was an old colleague of
                    mine from Harvard, was then Secretary of Labor. He took the initiative in urging
                    that I be named. He obtained the agreement of Kissinger, who was then Secretary
                    of State, and the two obtained my nomination by the White House. So in the fall
                    of 1975 I returned to the government payroll as U.S. Representative to the ILO.
                    At the time I made it clear that I would return just for the two years, that
                    whether we won or lost I would leave at the end of those two years. In addition
                    to being the U.S. Representative in the ILO, I was named as Special Assistant to
                    the Secretary of Labor for ILO matters, and because of the importance attached
                    to the issue — the first time the United States Government had ever given notice
                    of withdrawal from a U.N. organization — the White House appointed a policy
                    committee which was made up of the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of
                    Commerce, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Advisor to the
                    President. The Secretary of Labor was named as Chairman, and I was named as
                    Counselor to the committee to set up its agenda and generally act as
                    counselor.</p>
                <p>The two years were a fascinating assignment in that what was involved basically
                    was the effort to attempt to get governments to live up to their obligations
                    under the ILO constitution, and to withstand the kinds of pressures to which
                    they were subjected by the Soviet Union, the Communist world and by the Arab
                    countries: not all of the Arab countries, but the extremist regimes were able to
                    intimidate the majority of the Arab countries. My own activity was divided
                    between Washington, where I acted as counselor to the interdepartmental
                    committee, Geneva where I was the U.S. Representative to the Governing Body of
                    the ILO, as well as chairman of the annual delegation of the ILO Conference, and
                    then in addition my activity involved traveling around the world to meet with
                    foreign ministers, labor ministers, sometimes heads of government to attempt to
                    obtain commitments that they would follow the procedures required in the ILO and
                    make it possible for us to remain in the organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>During those two years I traveled around. . . — I once calculated that it was
                    something like 70,000 miles, not counting the visits to Europe — . . . visiting
                    third world countries in Latin America, Africa, East Asia, Middle East. By and
                    large the experience was both a satisfying one as well as a frustrating one,
                    because what gradually emerged, and this focused mainly in Africa, was that
                    while the officials in individual African countries with whom I consulted were
                    willing to go along with our suggested posture to make it possible for us to
                    remain in the ILO, they were subject to enormous pressures from the Arab
                    countries with enormous sums of money offered from the Middle East for technical
                    assistance at stake, which they knew they would lose if they didn't follow the
                    preferences of the Arab countries with respect to ILO issues. The result was
                    that while in the Governing Body [of the ILO] it was possible for us to win
                    occasional victories, particularly since the tripartite nature of the ILO made
                    it possible to overcome the government pressures if we could achieve secret
                    ballot,. . . — In some cases we did, in some cases we didn't. — . . . in the
                    Conference it was more difficult. The annual conference of 1977, the last
                    conference before we had to make up our minds, started out under promising
                    circumstances. Within the Arab group, the moderate elements with whom I had been
                    consulting closely through the previous two years succeeded in obtaining a
                    majority within the group for about 24 hours, and then lost it again to the
                    extremist elements, and from then on it was all downhill. Everyone agreed at the
                    end of the conference that it had been a disaster from the point of view of the
                    issues with which we were concerned.</p>
                <p>It then became necessary for the United States Government to make up its mind.
                    What had happened through our campaign of the previous two years is that the
                    Soviet Union had generally spread word that we were bluffing, that it was not
                    our intention to leave the ILO, and that we were simply using the threat of
                    leaving as blackmail to force governments to do what they didn't want to do.
                    Many of the countries found it difficult to accept the fact that we were serious
                    in our determination to leave the organization if things were not turned
                    around.</p>
                <p>When the notice had been given to the ILO in 1975, a statement was issued by
                    President Ford which underscored the importance which he, the President, gave to
                    the organization and the issues involved, but that he was committing the
                    government to withdraw at the end of two years if things were not turned around.
                    When Jimmy Carter became President at the beginning of 1977, I had drafted a
                    similar statement which he issued underscoring the same kinds of considerations
                    which were contained in the statement of President Ford. And so, in the late
                    summer and early autumn of 1977 in meetings of our interdepartmental advisory
                    committee, the question then was debated as to what was to be done. Up to that
                    point there had been no dissent from the official position. What had shaped up
                    in the months after the conference of late June 1977 was that many of those
                    officials who had supported the policy of the government really didn't have the
                    stomach for pulling out when the issue came to a crunch. One of the principal
                    people reacting in this fashion was the Assistant Secretary for International
                    Organization Affairs in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: He had been Editor of Foreign Policy, Carnegie Foundation, Bill
                    Maynes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Maynes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Bill Maynes, a very bright fellow, but he obviously couldn't envisage
                    our pulling out of a U.N. organization. In any event, what he did was informally
                    to circularize governments around the world to promote appeals to the United
                    States to stay in the ILO. And so a flood of appeals came in because the natural
                    inclination of governments in any event was to keep United States from pulling
                    out of the organization. What Maynes did with this material was unfortunate in
                    that in the briefing that he gave to Vance, then Secretary of State, he
                    described these appeals as commitments to live up to the objectives that we were
                    seeking. No such commitment was involved. All they did was appeal for us to stay
                    in.</p>
                <p>It was all focused then by those who were reluctant to have us pull out that we
                    extend for another year our notice, and that we see whether we can turn things
                    around in one more year. The difficulty with that kind of approach was first we
                    had been saying that we were serious and would pull out at the end of two years.
                    To have extended it for another year would have been belying our sincerity, and
                    in any event would have violated a constitutional provision which requires
                    simply a two-year notice, not a three-year notice. The meeting where
                    recommendations were to be made in the advisory committee was attended by the
                    principals, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of State,
                    National Security Advisor. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce had an
                    advisory role, and they also attended. Ray Marshall, who at that time was
                    Secretary of Labor, presided at the meeting. The Secretary of Commerce was
                    Juanita Kreps, who had apparently in private conversations indicated that she
                    would support the position that Ray Marshall and I had taken, that we had no
                    alternative but to get out of the ILO. Nonetheless, in the actual meeting, she
                    decided that Commerce did not have a sufficient interest in this issue to take a
                    position. On the other hand, Brzezinski as National Security Advisor took the
                    position that we should not pull out but extend the notice by a year as did
                    Secretary Vance.</p>
                <p>The argument for pulling out, which I made at the meeting and which was opposed
                    by both the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor, was that we
                    had exhausted our bargaining power within the organization, that we would have
                    more bargaining power outside than we would within the organization, that the
                    intention was not to pull out forever but to pull out until things had changed,
                    and that we could get those changes made better if we were outside than if we
                    were inside. In any event, the meeting then ended up in a divided position, and
                    it was on that basis that it was agreed that the recommendation to the President
                    would reflect the two points of view, leaving it to the President to make the
                    decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>This was done, and when the memoranda arrived on President Carter's desk, he had
                    a typical straightforward reaction that characterized so much of his
                    personality. He said, “But haven't I made the announcement, haven't I issued a
                    statement that if we didn't achieve certain objectives, we would pull out of the
                    organization at the end of two years? Everyone agrees that we did not achieve
                    our objectives. Then what's the question? Obviously we must pull out,” and he
                    decided, I think for the first time on a major issue, against the advice of his
                    Secretary of State and National Security Advisor and agreed that we should pull
                    out of the organization. The statement of withdrawal, which I mainly drafted,
                    expressed regret at having to pull out, hope that things would change, that we
                    would continue to have an interest in affairs of the ILO, and that it was our
                    hope that we could within a short time return to the organization. With that we
                    left the organization, and as I had agreed in taking the position as U.S.
                    representative that I would leave at the end of two years, I resigned and
                    retired at that time.</p>
                <p>That was my last labor assignment. That was my second retirement. This concludes
                    the chronology of my experiences in the Foreign Service in the field of
                    labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll write it, say, as a postscript.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: A postscript to the ILO affair. The fact is that during the two years
                    following our withdrawal, things improved sufficiently that it was possible for
                    us to return to the ILO in 1980, as I remember it. This does conclude my
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. This is Herbert Weiner. Dan and I will now have
                        a bit of a discussion as to what are some of the lessons we've learned from
                        these experiences in the formation of the Labor Attach� Program which might
                        be of value to us today and some of the issues that are arising. For
                        example, in my own interview I've mentioned that the Labor Attach� was a
                        wide-ranging officer which didn't fit into any one organizational niche, and
                        that my assignments had varied ranging all the way from political-economic
                        to even technical issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>During the Cold War, the labor attach�s became more and more politicized in terms
                    of the problems they dealt with. The Cold War is now over, but the question
                    remains; What sort of functions do the Labor Attach�s have now? Do they matter?
                    Are they needed in countries that have no democratic governments. The big issues
                    are now international trade. Our relationships are heavily economic now. The
                    reconstruction of Eastern Europe involves economic, political, mixed
                    political-economic issues. Is a labor officer merely another form of political
                    officer. Dan, would you care to comment on some of these observations?</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Sure. As far as my own experience is concerned in terms of
                    administrative assignment within the embassy, it didn't matter whether I was
                    assigned, as I sometimes was, to the economic section or sometimes to the
                    political section. In every case, I functioned as if I were part of both. I
                    attended all the staff meetings of the economic section as well as the political
                    section, and where there was a country team, I was a member of that country
                    team. It never was a choice between political and economic; it was a matter of
                    relative emphasis. In the kind of reporting which I did, there always were
                    regular economic reports as well as regular political reports. The countries
                    that I was assigned to generally required, from the point of view of our foreign
                    policy, more emphasis on the political than on the economic, but that was a
                    result of circumstances of these individual countries.</p>
                <p>As far as the change of general framework resulting from the end of the Cold War
                    [is concerned], in that regard we've come full circle. We must remember that the
                    labor attach� program was started before the Cold War. In 1943, 1944, and 1945,
                    there was no Cold War, and yet the logic, the rationale, for the establishment
                    of the Labor Attach� Program at that time exists again today. One could say that
                    on the basis of the considerations at that time toward the close of World War
                    II, it was felt that labor in its political form, in its trade union form, and
                    in its mass organization form would have significant influence on the direction
                    of a country's foreign policy, and that it was important that we understand
                    these underlying forces within the country in order to understand their foreign
                    policy that necessity exists as much today as it did then.</p>
                <p>In some respects perhaps one could say that the Cold War period, covering as it
                    does most of the years since the establishment of the Labor Attach� Program,
                    nonetheless was a distortion of the normal expectations, which had prompted the
                    felt necessity at the time of establishing a Labor Attach� Program, and which
                    exist even more now. Whether the focus be toward economic or political is a
                    function of both foreign policy contingencies as well as the particular country
                    which is subject to analysis, but for an understanding of pressures which exist
                    within a country in one direction or another of any issues, for an understanding
                    of the stability of countries, for an understanding of yes, even with an
                    emphasis on trade and the rest the importance of understanding how much
                    commitments are worth, as well as the longevity of governments, one must have an
                    understanding of the underlying pressures that exist in any country.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The question of political versus economic is in some regards a false issue,
                    because as far as labor is concerned it automatically, of necessity, covers
                    both. The concern that in some countries where the trade union movement may not
                    be a principal organization influencing affairs is only one aspect, or should be
                    only one aspect, of the concern of a labor specialist on assignment in an
                    embassy. What he is basically concerned with is the direction that a mass
                    movement may take and its potential impact. And this involves the ability to
                    travel, to understand social movements, to develop relations with leaders and
                    potential leaders, to have close concern for the direction that things may take
                    in mass organizations. To argue that if it's principally political, then all you
                    need is a political officer, carries one back to the situation that existed
                    before the Second World War, when the Foreign Service Officer was regarded as
                    someone who could do anything, and it was discovered, when the war got under
                    way, that a Foreign Service Officer couldn't do everything. You needed
                    specialists. You needed people that understood certain kinds of technical and
                    social phenomena. You needed officers who had training to understand mass
                    movements. You had the need then for specialization.</p>
                <p>If one were to dig out of the files and read the letter written in 1943 by our
                    Ambassador to Mexico, Ambassador Messersmith, one would have all the classic
                    arguments for the need to have generalists in the Foreign Service without any
                    specialty. If the argument today is made that if labor is largely political,
                    then it can be done by political officers, it's the same logic which had been
                    followed by Messersmith. Surely the history of the last 50 years in our Foreign
                    Service has underscored, and I should hope that we've learned, that a Foreign
                    Service Officer, however well educated, however competent, however intelligent,
                    cannot do everything. The world is too specialized, the scope of interest in
                    foreign affairs is too wide. We must have specialists. Surely that's not an
                    argument which should arise 50 years after it was settled, settled not just by
                    administrative judgment, but by the facts which evolved in those succeeding
                    years.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that I regard the Labor Attach� function to be simply a
                    political function. It is a function which includes heavily economic, social,
                    and political, and that the interest of the State Department has largely been
                    social and political does not mean that political should not be taken in its
                    narrow sense which involves then simply trade union organizations. It never was
                    intended that way, and surely we've learned by now that the underlying pressures
                    that exist in a society, whether institutionalized or not, ultimately determine
                    the direction that that society takes, and therefore the foreign policy which
                    that society follows is something which we as a government must continue to be
                    concerned about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do have one more question, Dan. In terms of your
                        experience, and we're talking now about a half century, in terms of sources
                        of this talent that we're looking for in the Labor Attach� Program, are
                        there any specific characteristics or sources that you see preferable to one
                        over the other, or do you just have to deal with each case as it
                        arises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: I would be a little reluctant. . .</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I raise this question because the argument has been made
                        that only somebody who comes from the trade unions could be a good Labor
                        Attach�, [because they are] the only ones who would have sensitivity to the
                        labor issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: Well, the latter point which, as you say, is sometimes made makes no
                    sense to me whatsoever. The fact is that one does not have to be a trade
                    unionist to understand trade union problems, certainly not societal problems.
                    Where the Labor Attach� should come from, my own feeling has been through these
                    many years when for a time Labor Attach�s were simply drawn from outside, and
                    then for a longer period trained within the Foreign Service, that what is
                    necessary is a mixture of the two. One should not depend entirely on people from
                    outside, nor should the people from outside uniformly come from one milieu.</p>
                <p>In the early days of the Labor Attach� Program, most of the people who came to
                    the specialty had come out of academic pursuits, or from other government
                    agencies. None had come from the trade union movements. I say movements because
                    at that time there were, of course, the AFL as well as the CIO. And that had its
                    weaknesses too. No. To draw people from outside, in my view, means to draw not
                    on the basis of the origin of the individual, not on the basis of his experience
                    alone, though that counts, but also basically and primarily on the evaluation
                    made of the individual. Some trade unions can make it; some cannot. Some
                    academic people can make it; some cannot.</p>
                <p>At the same time, what they generally lack is, almost by definition, experience
                    in the foreign affairs field, in the State Department, in diplomacy. This, the
                    Foreign Service Officer, basically has, training as a diplomat. If he is to be a
                    Labor Attach�,. . . — and I think what will probably continue, with the budget
                    constraints that exist, will be that most of the Labor Attach�s will be drawn
                    from the career service, and this is not a bad thing, provided it is most and
                    not all. — . . . a Foreign Service Officers trained as a Labor Attach� should be
                    well trained. This may involve an investment of time, money, technical training,
                    but will pay off in the long run.</p>
                <p>For me, the mixture is important. People from the outside [should be] brought in
                    occasionally, not to top positions but to lower and middle rank positions to set
                    certain standards from the outside, whereas the bulk of the Foreign Service
                    Officers who will become Labor Attach�s would provide the background which
                    people coming in from outside generally lack, and that is the familiarity with
                    diplomatic processes and the atmosphere which one must live in the Foreign
                    Service. Does that cover your question?-</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That covers it fine. I have two more questions that used
                        to come up regularly. Somehow they have faded now, but they will show up
                        again I am sure as when there are foreign policy strains. One, for a long
                        time, and I know I myself was once the subject of these kinds of attacks,
                        the argument was made that Labor Attach�s were CIA agents or had been. In
                        other words, in a sense they were spies, and they were frequently labeled as
                        CIA agents. In your experience, is there anything to substantiate that kind
                        of an attack? I certainly have heard it made from, quote, so-called
                        respectable quarters who I thought would know better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The other thing, in a sense a related kind of an issue, was that the American
                    trade unions were sort of a cat's-paw of American foreign policy in carrying out
                    American government foreign policy. Could you talk about those two points?</p>
                <p>HOROWITZ: As to the first, the allegation of CIA control or service, I never felt
                    that I had to contend with that kind of attitude as a handicap in my work. The
                    important thing for a Labor Attach� in his associations with the trade union
                    people, management people, political people, government people, journalists or
                    the rest, the important characteristic which he must demonstrate is that he
                    knows the problems, he knows his field. If this is evident to his contacts, to
                    his associations, then the question of CIA control becomes subsidiary. That the
                    American government would have interest in knowing what is going on in another
                    country has by now percolated down sufficiently that it doesn't automatically
                    carry the label of covert intelligence. I don't regard this as a major
                    issue.</p>
                <p>To some extent we have had in the past the reverse kind of issue in the AID
                    programs and in the early days in the Marshall Plan. Practically all of the
                    labor specialist positions were named with people of trade union background. Too
                    frequently the people on their jobs abroad tried to give the impression that
                    they were still acting as trade unionists, and this is the kind of thing, which
                    I'm tempted to say, doesn't fool anybody. They knew what payroll these people
                    were on, and to pretend that they are trade unionists. . . — You know, the badge
                    they carry. — . . . is short run nonsense and doesn't gain anything. I should
                    cite my own experience in this regard. In India where on arriving, the AID labor
                    officer, a bright, intelligent, capable officer, ex-UAW (United Automobile
                    Workers) functioning as if he were still on trade union payroll and not on
                    government payroll, trying to convince people that he was still a trade
                    unionist, out of good intentions offered to take me around when I first arrived
                    and introduce me to the trade union people who were his contacts in Delhi and
                    around the country. I was put in the embarrassing situation with this
                    good-natured, intelligent fellow saying to him, “Thank you very much, but no
                    thanks. I'll make my own way.” I had no intention of being labeled as a
                    successor to my own predecessor who had also been posing as a trade unionist. No
                    one was fooled by it, and I had no intention of functioning in any other way, or
                    giving the impression in any other way of being other than an officer of the
                    embassy.</p>

                        movement was merely a cat's-paw of American foreign policy, an agent of

                <p>HOROWITZ: If I remember correctly, I covered part of this earlier in my interview
                    so that I don't want to cover ground that I've already gone over. But the
                    criticism in this regard of trade unionists generally emanated from left wing
                    elements in the United States. It was a way of attempting to repudiate, to
                    discredit the kind of work which the American trade union movement had
                    undertaken, particularly in Europe as you say, and particularly during the
                    period when it was so vital as to whether the countries of Western Europe would
                    succumb to Communism using the fulcrum of the trade union movement.</p>
                <p>No, the American trade union movement surely has demonstrated over time that it
                    will be no organization's cat's-paw, and certainly not that of the government,
                    that the interests of the American trade union movement and the American
                    Government coincided for long periods of time. On the other hand, from what I
                    saw, there was a good deal of reason to believe in fact that more frequently
                    than not, the influence was the other way around. That is, the American
                    Government, which in most cases did not make labor its principal focal point of
                    interest in foreign affairs, sometimes accepted the analysis or the pressures or
                    the presentations of the American trade union movement on specific issues. Not
                    always. In fact, there were differences. Or what can one say when at one stage
                    in France there were two representatives of American labor, one of the AFL and
                    one of the CIO, and where the two worked at cross purposes and in different
                    directions? Which one followed the lead of the Government? The answer, of
                    course, is neither, and I think over time people in the countries where the
                    American trade union movement has worked have understood this, just as now it is
                    true [for] the foreign labor institutes sponsored by the AFL-CIO. In this case,
                    there may be more substance in the allegation, but still not fundamentally so,
                    substance in a sense that most of the funds overtly come from the AID, and while
                    the American trade union movement itself finances part of the operations, much
                    of the money does come from Government, and yet the programs developed by these
                    institutes represent either the interest of the American trade union movement,
                    or they aren't conducted at all. By now, I think this kind of argument really
                    carries little weight indeed.</p>
