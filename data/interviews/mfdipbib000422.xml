                <p>AMBASSADOR JON DAVID GLASSMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Peter Moffat</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 19, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Mr. Glassman, maybe you could tell us how you happened to come into the
                    Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: It was my life-long ambition. I used to read Time magazine as a young
                    person growing up. I was fascinated with world affairs so I enrolled in the
                    School of International Relations at the University of Southern California. I
                    received a Bachelor of Foreign Service degree. Then I became interested in
                    Russian area studies and went to Columbia University where I received a masters
                    degree, a Certificate at the Russian Institute and Ph.D. in 1976. I departed
                    from the Columbia campus in 1968 and joined the Foreign Service. At that point
                    you weren't allowed to go to Moscow for your first assignment. So, despite being
                    a Russian expert, I was assigned to San Jose, Costa Rica. An opportunity to go
                    to Czechoslovakia temporarily, however, came up. But I never went because the
                    Russians invaded Czechoslovakia. Accordingly I ended up in Madrid as my first
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were a Junior Officer in Madrid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which function did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: I was three weeks in the consular section, six months in the economics
                    section but ended up in the political section for the remainder of my tour. We
                    had two ambassadors there; the first was Robert Wagner, the former Mayor of New
                    York City. He left shortly thereafter and was replaced by a man named Robert
                    Charles Hill who had been a close collaborator of John Foster Dulles and a
                    prot�g� of John Davis Lodge who also had been Ambassador to Spain. We saw a lot
                    of Ambassador Lodge as time went on there.</p>
                <p>Q: If I'm correct, Franco finally died in 1975 but you must have been there for
                    shall we say his declining years. What was your impression of Spain at the
                    time?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Franco was preparing for the succession so he opened up the political
                    process for what he called associations as opposed to political parties. A
                    number of semi- democratic politicians began to emerge. He also decided to bring
                    back Prince Juan Carlos to be his successor. You may recall the true successor
                    to the Spanish throne was Don Juan who lived in Estoril in Portugal. He was
                    considered unreliable and somewhat of a leftist so Franco had taken Juan Carlos
                    and put him in a lot of Spanish Military Schools. He was considered a person who
                    might be malleable, might be brought into Spain as a potential successor and
                    would not be a danger. I should say that also in the embassy we had the same
                    impression of Juan Carlos, because he had a U.S. Army man who was his karate
                    instructor and the idea was they were going to bring Juan Carlos back into Spain
                    and perhaps bring the karate instructor along with him and this would be a
                    source of continuing influence. There also was a Spanish military man named
                    Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, who was Franco's Prime Minister. He was also
                    considered to be an important person favoring U.S. interests in the transition.
                    Franco would phase out, Juan Carlos would be brought in as a kind of entity who
                    would reign over this and then Carrero Blanco and the military would be key
                    figures running the country. There was also a group of economic ministers
                    associated with Opus Dei, the Catholic lay movement, and they were called
                    technocrats. They were very much partisans of the Western economic model so you
                    would have a transition from a fascist corporate state to modern capitalism with
                    the military backing up the alliance with the United States. You may recall that
                    we had air force bases and naval bases in Spain, including a nuclear submarine
                    base at Rota. We had Torrejon Air Base just outside Madrid and Zaragoza from
                    where U.S. strategic bombers could reach the Soviet Union. So, it was a very
                    tight relationship. The U.S. 16th Air Force headquarters were in Spain at that
                    time. Because of its air and naval strategic roles, Spain was considered to be
                    very important to the nuclear balance of power. Accordingly, the transition from
                    Franco was quite sensitive.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Concerning Prince Juan Carlos, there was some controversy about whether he would
                    be merely a symbolic figure. Ambassador Robert Hill thought that Juan Carlos
                    would be a strong ruler. If I can recall an interesting anecdote, I was asked to
                    write a paper on Juan Carlos as a potential ruler. I and the other political
                    officers thought that Juan Carlos would reign but not really rule. In those
                    days, the embassy didn't work on Wednesday afternoon so Ambassador Hill asked me
                    to stay late. I was sitting in the embassy waiting three or four hours and the
                    embassy was just empty, quiet, no one there. Then about six o'clock, Hill called
                    me into the front office and he said, “You just made a terrible error.” I said,
                    “What is it, Mr. Ambassador?” He said, “This paper you've written says Juan
                    Carlos will reign and not rule.” He said, “I can tell you that's false.” I said,
                    “How's that, Mr. Ambassador?” He said, “Well, I was down at the Cortes
                    (Parliament) and I saw how Juan Carlos walked. He had the walk of a ruler and if
                    you look at his blood... You haven't mentioned anything about his blood. He has
                    the blood of Polish kings, of French kings - all strong rulers.” He said, “You
                    must mention his blood.” I said, “Yes sir, Mr. Ambassador. I'll certainly do
                    that.” So, I went back and rewrote an airgram - actually said that Juan Carlos
                    was likely to be a strong ruler. Among the things I mentioned pursuant to the
                    Ambassador's instructions, was his blood. We sent it in to George Landau, who
                    was then the Country Director for Spain and Portugal. He came back and said,
                    “Are you people insane?” The Ambassador, indeed, held strong views and he
                    thought Juan Carlos would be a good ruler. In fact, notwithstanding the somewhat
                    eccentric basis for his conclusions, Ambassador Hill was correct in asserting
                    positive views about Juan Carlos' potential.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to form effective opinions on how the embassy functioned from
                    your relatively low position? Obviously you dealt with the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Oh, yes, it was very interesting. Hill was very much an absolutist. He
                    wanted to impose his personality on the embassy. We would have country team
                    meetings. Hill would insist on having his staff meeting in the auditorium, in
                    which would participate not only the section heads, but every officer and every
                    secretary, every American there. So, we would have these large staff meetings in
                    the auditorium and then Hill would call up the heads of section to stand in
                    front of the crowd with him. Then he would proceed often to humiliate them in
                    front of the crowd. This was his technique to maintain control. He also had
                    some, of course, close confidants. One of them was a man named Harry Bergold,
                    who later became an Ambassador. Harry had been also the assistant of Wagner, who
                    was a liberal Democrat. Hill was a right wing Republican. Harry readily changed
                    his perspective. He would come over, have drinks with Hill every night at the
                    residence, which was attached to the embassy. That would be a sort of inner
                    circle, then Hill would have the larger staff meeting in a way I just described.
                    He would also bring in guests from the States such as Ambassador John Davis
                    Lodge, and Holmes Alexander, the columnist. They would also speak in front of
                    the entire embassy staff. One instance I remember was when John Davis Lodge was
                    there. He had been an actor who had played in the film the Scarlet Empress
                    (about Catherine the Great). He styled himself as a great authority on
                    Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Another thing Ambassador Hill did, he would have a weekly football games flown in
                    by TWA. All officers had to assemble every Friday afternoon to watch the
                    football games together and Hill would have a running commentary on the game
                    while this was going on. This was his absolutist style.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Madrid during the time of student demonstrations around
                        thworld did any intrude on your life in Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: American students would frequently come and hold demonstrations outside
                    the embassy. Ambassador Hill requested on one occasion that the police arrest
                    the students. We tried to reason with him, saying that all these students, as
                    reprehensible as they might be, have congressman back home and this would be a
                    very troublesome thing. So Hill reluctantly agreed finally not to have the
                    police used against the students and had them instead come in and speak to him.
                    Of course, Hill hated the demonstrators.</p>
                <p>I remember he also would go back to the States during the time and see the
                    demonstrations occurring. He would then hold his typical large embassy staff
                    meeting and commiserate over the bad situation in the U.S.</p>
                <p>Q: You were then transferred to an area of your greater expertise - Moscow - but
                    one that was also under something of a dead hand politically at the time. Did it
                    live up to your expectations when you went in 1971?</p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: In those days we all lived in diplomatic apartment buildings. All the
                    foreign diplomats, including Eastern Europeans, lived there. The first year we
                    were out at Leninsky Prospekt 93, which was at the edge of the city. Every
                    morning when we got ready for work we would see eight to 10 Soviets leave the
                    building. They would have live electronic monitoring in those days. When you
                    would leave the building, perhaps to take a walk, they would start telephoning
                    your wife and so forth, and doing all kinds of things. In the first six months
                    we were there, we would get phone call provocations and threats. It was a rather
                    tense time in the States because the Jewish Defense League was persecuting the
                    Soviet diplomats here. So, in retaliation, the Soviet KGB would do things to us
                    and threaten us. They would also follow and surveil us.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We were often followed very closely when we traveled. I visited 17 provincial
                    cities. We would try to engage in conversation with people on those trips but we
                    would try to choose the people with whom we would talk, rather than allowing the
                    KGB to set up our encounters. We would go sometimes to public parks and sit down
                    with people and just try to talk about what was going on in the city. We would
                    also go out and buy books. There was a person - a publications procurement
                    officer - who would buy books from provincial publishing houses. We would go
                    with him on trips and frequently on the trips they were watched very closely.
                    Sometimes there would be sixteen people in different teams of four and several
                    cars that would follow us. When we would go in the bookstores, they would come
                    very close sometimes, really close, and lean up against us to intimidate us.
                    They would also sit down at tables in restaurants with us. Once my wife and I
                    were at a restaurant outside Riga - a place called the Yuras Perla Restaurant.
                    We had made reservations late in the day so they had placed some KGB people at
                    our table. They had not used their English speakers - it was too late in the
                    day. I could, of course, understand everything they were saying in Russian. They
                    were saying that they had to engage us in conversation and, if it wasn't
                    worthwhile, they would wait for us down at the train station. So we got very
                    nervous of course and quickly departed for the train station with them in hot
                    pursuit. Those kinds of things would happen. Once, I was down at Dushanbe,
                    Tajikistan. I and the other officer in the room were sleeping and then a crack
                    of light appeared at the door. Two people walked in. I yelled in Russian, “Get
                    out of here!” We then walked out to the woman who was the duty officer at the
                    hotel. She said, “It was just a couple of drunks walking in.” The Soviets would
                    do things like this. People would go on picnics and Soviet girls would enter
                    their tents. All kinds of provocations would occur. That was the atmosphere of
                    the times - very tight, very suspicious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Remind us who your Ambassador was at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: That was Jacob Beam, a 40 year veteran of the Foreign Service. I recall
                    a terrible instance for him. He once called a staff meeting and was almost in
                    tears. “What's wrong, Mr. Ambassador,” we asked. He said the most terrible thing
                    had happened to him, Henry Kissinger who was the President's National Security
                    Advisor had come to Moscow but did not inform the Ambassador. Kissinger was
                    engaged in the back channel contacts then.</p>
                <p>About that time, the famous Moscow Summit of 1972 was held. Nixon came and there
                    was quite an interesting little scene there. They had divided the American
                    delegation and they put Secretary of State William Rogers in the Hotel Rossiya.
                    Kissinger and Nixon stayed at the Kremlin, which isolated the Secretary of State
                    from this. I was on duty one night at the Rossiya and received calls from the
                    Nixon entourage people like Dwight Chapin who later became famous in Watergate.
                    Chapin brusquely ordered the Secretary of State to go immediately to the Kremlin
                    - it was clear that Roger's status was very much subordinate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a pattern that continued all through the
                        Kissinger years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: I'm sure it did. Kissinger came to Moscow several times. I remember
                    meeting him at the airport. He thought we were the Russians, we all wore these
                    fur hats. He said, “Thank you for your hospitality comrades.” We said, “We're
                    from the embassy.” He turned his head and quickly walked away - he was really
                    quite something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you privy to any of the Nixon Summit doings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Not the substance. As a junior officer, I mainly partook of the
                    wonderful food the Soviets put out during the time of the visit. Notwithstanding
                    the historical significance of this period - the dawn of detente, a number of
                    amusing incidents took place. Nixon wanted to give a present to Brezhnev and so
                    he gave him a Cadillac. Brezhnev was so reckless he broke a windshield, and we
                    were always bringing him spare parts. Another interesting thing happened during
                    the Summit, again sort of revealing. The Soviets would not allow Nixon to use
                    Air Force One for internal flights. When Nixon departed for Kiev, the Soviet
                    leadership put him on an airplane and lined up to see him off. They were
                    standing there on nationwide television and the plane wouldn't start up. So a
                    terrible thing took place. Soviet Minister of Defense Marshal Grechko had to go
                    up on the Aeroflot plane and tell Nixon he had to get off. A replacement plane
                    had to be towed in, oranges and other special items unloaded from the first
                    plane. Of course, television coverage ceased immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an excellent Russian speaker, were you able to
                        integrate intany social life, local life, or was it really artificial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: We would go around and speak to people in these provincial towns. You
                    would discover very interesting things out there. Once, when we were down in
                    Donetsk in the Southern Ukraine, we were sitting in the park one day chatting
                    and we heard rock and roll music on a transistor radio. I said, “This is
                    amazing, you know, I didn't realize the transistor radios could pick up short
                    wave broadcasts.” “That's not short wave. It's a local station,” a local
                    resident said. It turns out there were amateur radio operators broadcasting in
                    the Soviet Union. This was the first idea we had that people were starting to
                    generate their own autonomous non-regime cultural activity.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We also, on another occasion, got on a train and were talking to some of the
                    Soviet troops who had just gotten back from Germany - very interesting. We were
                    able to report on popular points of view and also on emerging attitudes in
                    Central Asia. I had my own special hobby, collecting Soviet Military books, not
                    only current ones but also old ones. Every weekend, I would have a regular
                    routine - I would go to the Military book store and to used bookstores. I
                    accumulated a superb collection. I had almost every Soviet military book
                    published from the 1920s onward which I subsequently gave away to Harriet Fast
                    Scott who was sort of an expert on those things.No one in the embassy, believe
                    it or not, was reporting on arms control in those days. So, even as a humble
                    consular officer, I was able to start calling at the USA Institute and at IMEMO
                    (the Institute of Economy and International Relations). I spoke with their arms
                    control people, many of whom were retired Soviet military people. This worked
                    out very well - it was the beginning of the so-called Mutual Balance Force
                    Reduction (MBFR) talks. Subsequently, the State Department established a
                    permanent arms control position reporting at Embassy Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to Harvard to continue this interest in arms
                        control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: The Council of Foreign Relations was kind enough to give me a grant to
                    write at Harvard. I joined there with Professor Paul Doty, who began the Program
                    on Science and International Affairs, a program which focused on arms control. I
                    started to do some writing and in October 1973 war broke out in the Middle East.
                    Professor Doty sent me out to Israel to do some interviews, particularly
                    regarding the Soviet role before and during the war. I did further research and
                    wrote a book called Arms for the Arabs. The Soviet Union and War in the Middle
                    East which is basically a record of Soviet weapon supplies before the three wars
                    in the Middle East (the 1956 Suez war, 1967 Six Day war, and the 1973 October
                    War). The bottom line of the book is that the client (in this case, Egypt)
                    pulled the Soviets toward ever greater involvement in terms of the quality of
                    weapons they provided and in terms of threats to enter the respective wars. You
                    may recall that, at the end of the 1973 war, the Soviets not only threatened to
                    intervene but also permitted or actually fired Scud missiles - the same ones we
                    saw recently in Iraq. What I talk about in the book is the function of the Scud
                    as a regionally strategic weapon. It was not strategic in the sense that the
                    United States and Soviet Union could have been threatened, but because its range
                    allowed it to target the vitals of the Middle Eastern antagonists. Accordingly,
                    it could drag the Soviets and, also of course, the Americans, into protecting
                    their respective clients in those contests. That was one of the things we would
                    see later on as we would go through the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviets would
                    become involved in these regional contests and basically drag themselves into
                    confrontation with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the book received?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Among the three people who bought it, it was nicely received. But what
                    it did was attract some people in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into
                    getting more interested in regional things. I was asked to join them and we
                    started working on European regional arms control, particularly on control of
                    theater nuclear weapons. The arms control agency was headed by Dr. Fred Ikl� who
                    was a realist; many considered him a hard liner. He was advised by Paul
                    Wolfowitz, who later became Under Secretary of Defense. Dr. Ikl� was less
                    interested in limiting arms and more in limiting the suspicions that might lead
                    to war. He was more interested in Open Skies and measures that would prevent
                    crises than limitation of arms. This was another alternative way of going about
                    arms control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us your position at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, I was a regional analyst and I was asked to look into the status
                    of the respective forces in Central Europe. I was also asked to participate in
                    so-called environmental modification talks, which led to the so-called En Mod
                    treaty. This again was another alternative to hard arms control limitation of
                    weapons. Dr. Ikl�'s idea was that we should move in areas that at some future
                    point, perhaps 30-50 years in the future, might represent threats, try to
                    foreclose the threats now and avoid limiting our current capability while we
                    were engaged in Cold War with the Soviet Union. We went over to Moscow and
                    participated in negotiating a treaty which is still in existence which prevents
                    use of climate modification as an instrument of war. That means, for instance,
                    reversing the course of the rivers in Siberia to prevent a warming in the Arctic
                    ocean which could change weather patterns and things like that.I also went down
                    to Antarctica. We have a treaty to prevent Antarctica from being militarized so
                    to make that treaty a real treaty, we would inspect foreign bases periodically.
                    I went down as part of an interagency team and we visited the bases of
                    Argentina, Chile, Britain, Soviet Union and made sure that they were
                    weapons-free. The Soviets had an interesting field tank farm which was
                    sufficient to refuel a lot more than what they had there. People thought they
                    had established the base so that in event of a global war, they would have sites
                    in the South Atlantic to refuel their ships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression as to the role of ACDA at the
                        time? Wait considered heavyweight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: No, Ikl� was put in there by Kissinger as a kind of gesture to the
                    right wing. He was basically cut out; the way it would work structurally is that
                    we wrote memos to the Director (Dr. Ikl�) who, in turn, reported to the
                    Secretary of State (Kissinger). Kissinger was running his own foreign policy and
                    kept Ikl� in for symbolic reasons but ACDA wasn't intended to be a serious
                    operation. You may recall later when the pressure in Congress on Kissinger
                    became greater, some of the people, Wolfowitz and others, participated in
                    alternative intelligence analysis of Soviet forces - the so-called team B
                    exercise and so many of these people who were in ACDA achieved greater influence
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Q: I imagine you returned to the Department later with some pleasure to get back
                    into the bilateral Soviet-U.S. situation as an advisor to Marshal Shulman and
                    also as an officer in the Soviet Department.</p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, at ACDA, it was only possible to influence the Secretary of
                    State indirectly. So I decided to move back to State to the Soviet Desk -
                    EUR/SOV (Office of Soviet Affairs). I was given the arms control portfolio plus
                    the portfolio for Middle East, Africa and Latin America and that was a good
                    thing to get. The Soviets, at that point were becoming more active. This was
                    after you may recall the October war in the Middle East. The Soviets were
                    involved with Angola. Kissinger was confronting them on the one hand through
                    covert actions but, on the other hand, trying to continue detente. Congress was
                    pressing aggressively Jewish emigration.</p>
                <p>In order to execute this policy of going in two directions, Kissinger had to
                    maintain centralized control and the way he did this was by naming Hal
                    Sonnenfeldt as kind of a surrogate to monitor all things to do with Europe,
                    particularly the Soviets. On the Asian side, he had Winston Lord handling China.
                    This meant mechanically, any paper we did had to have Sonnenfeldt or his men
                    clear on it. Sonnenfeldt's men at that time were John Kelly, who became later an
                    Assistant Secretary and James Dobbins and another man by the name of Jim
                    Montgomery. We would go up there and every piece would be carefully vetted. This
                    was a bureaucratic vehicle for diminishing diversity and creating a policy which
                    Kissinger could manage with the least interference as possible from the
                    Department of State as a corporate body.</p>
                <p>In those days when Soviets were giving the speeches, the text would come spilling
                    out of the FBIS printers and we would write memos while the text would be coming
                    out. There was a strong demand for our information and analysis, but the
                    Department's impact on Kissinger's policy was minimal.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>After we were doing this for a few years, the election took place and Carter was
                    elected. When Cyrus Vance became the Secretary of State, he brought in Professor
                    Marshal Shulman of Columbia University as advisor on Soviet affairs. Since I had
                    been associated with him at Columbia, they made me his personal assistant for
                    the first six months of the Administration. What Shulman tried to do was to
                    divide his time between Columbia and the State Department, so he never became as
                    strong a player as he might have been. However, Cyrus Vance did respect him and
                    sought his advice and counsel. Shulman, you may recall, was sympathetic toward
                    the Russians. He didn't believe in confronting them. He felt that by having an
                    attitude of greater understanding towards them somehow we would get along better
                    with them. When he was absent from Washington, I would have to attend meetings
                    with Les Gelb who is now head of the Council of Foreign Relations, but at that
                    time was a director for Political Military affairs. He began preparing new
                    Administration briefs on strategic arms control with the Soviets. There was some
                    reason that they felt if we proposed really radical arms control reductions on
                    strategic weapons somehow the Soviets would find this congenial and would end
                    the Cold War. This turned out to be a profound mistake and misunderstanding. We,
                    Shulman and I - went to the first arms control meeting in Moscow. Bill Hyland,
                    the President's Deputy National Security Advisor, had remained behind, the
                    Administration was in such a terrible argument on how the arms control proposal
                    would be presented to the Soviets. There was one deep reduction proposal and a
                    much more modest one. There was arguing going on until the very last day. So we
                    went to Moscow and we were taken up to a guest house in Lenin Hills. Hyland
                    finally arrived and brought in the proposal approved by Carter. No one had seen
                    it. All the Americans were there for the meeting, so Hyland cut the proposal
                    into pieces and divided up these pieces of paper. Everybody in the room was
                    passing around the individual pieces of paper because they were so anxious to
                    see the final proposal. What had been approved was a proposal for deep cuts in
                    strategic weapons. It turned out to be a total failure. Gromyko took offense. It
                    was a terrible thing. The Russians held a press conference and they said this
                    was an absolute total failure - a bad start for the Carter Administration with
                    the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the Soviet approach at that
                        time - dithey try to take advantage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: They not only tried to take advantage because they felt that somehow
                    they had been confronted; remember in the Carter administration we had the
                    pulling and tugging between Brzezinski with a very hardline policy and Vance on
                    the other side. Vance continued to be influenced by Shulman. So, we had the
                    constant pulling and tugging. On strategic arms, Brzezinski had pushed hard for
                    deep cuts. The Soviets read it as an effort of some influential American circles
                    to confront them. So they began over time to see that Vance and Shulman, who
                    they felt were more sympathetic, were getting the worst of the distribution of
                    power in Washington. So they became more confrontational. More opportunities
                    were presenting themselves in the Third World. The U.S.-Soviet/Cuban surrogate
                    state struggle in Nicaragua had been going on for some time. Nicaragua began to
                    fall apart. The Cubans were drawing in the Russians then, if not materially, at
                    least spiritually. The idea began to spread in Moscow that there were more
                    opportunities out there in the Third World, that the United States was not
                    providing them the trade benefits they thought they would get through detente
                    because of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment (conditioning MFN treatment on Jewish
                    emigration). The arms control situation was in a sort of holding pattern because
                    of Carter's attempt to get the deep reductions first, so Soviets began to see
                    the Third World as a place of advantage and this in turn led to further
                    confrontations.</p>
                <p>Q: About your reward for all this good work by being sent as deputy for all your
                    work in Havana. This was quite a shift in your career pattern. How did it
                    happen?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: I had spoken Spanish from my youth and I spoke Russian. At the end of
                    the Ford years and the beginning of Carter, the Administration had had some
                    discreet contacts with the Cubans at the United Nations and other places. As you
                    recall, we had broken diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961. We had abandoned
                    our facilities in Havana and the Swiss had represented our interests in Cuba
                    over the years. Because the Carter group wanted to innovate, they decided they
                    would open a United States Interests Section as part of the Embassy of
                    Switzerland in Havana. I was successful in promoting my candidacy because of my
                    knowledge of Spanish and Russian so I was sent to Havana as deputy. We went in
                    there in difficult circumstances, since we had no housing. We all went to live
                    at the Havana Riviera Hotel in a group of ten people. The head of the mission
                    was a Foreign Service Officer by the name of Lyle Lane, a Latin Americanist.We
                    were asked to begin dangling in front of the Cubans the idea of eventual lifting
                    of the United States embargo on trade with Cuba. When we opened the Interests
                    Section in Cuba, the Cubans told us that their participation in Angola, where
                    they had sent 20 thousand troops and received material support from Soviets, was
                    an exception. This was going to end, it would not be repeated elsewhere. There
                    would be a normal state-to-state relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. What
                    the Carter Administration was dangling was an incentive for that to occur. Once
                    the Cubans were out of Angola, we would resume trade relations with them. My job
                    as a deputy was to begin visiting the various Cuban foreign trading entities,
                    and to tell them that, when the U.S. embargo was lifted, a number of
                    opportunities would open up. We were definitely holding that out as an incentive
                    to the Cubans. We were received very well initially by the Cubans; they allowed
                    us to move back into the American Embassy building - which had been occupied
                    previously by about four Swiss secretaries. They were quick to give us ten
                    houses which we began to restore. They gave us back the Ambassador's Residence
                    which was a magnificent 1930s building. We began to restore all these things.
                    The Cubans were very free initially with access.</p>
                <p>(The Cubans control the access unlike any other country in the world where I've
                    served. You could not call for appointments directly to people concerned; you
                    had to solicit meetings through the Foreign Ministry. You had to make an oral
                    and/or written request to them.)</p>
                <p>The first three months we were there almost all our requests were granted; we
                    were able to see almost any Cuban official we wanted in the trading entities and
                    the Foreign Ministry and the government in general. Also during these early
                    months, we had a number of congressional visits and these congressional visitors
                    were almost always received by Castro personally.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Castro had a personal entourage. There was one man, Pepe Naranjo, who was only
                    the Minister of Food Industry but was actually a personal friend of Castro.
                    Another friend was Osmany Cienfuegos, the brother of famous revolutionary Camilo
                    Cienfuegos. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez was always there - the Soviets' main
                    contact. Also Dr. Jose “Chomi” Miyar [Dr. Jose Manuel Miyar Barruecos], Castro's
                    personal secretary. It was an entourage who was with Castro and he would invite
                    the Congressmen to meet with them. They'd have a reception with this group, talk
                    with them and sometimes he would meet with them alone later. Castro had a very
                    special technique for his personal meetings. He would wait for the end of the
                    visit and he would frequently call people at midnight on the night before they
                    were to leave. The guest would sit for three or four hours talking to Castro. He
                    had a capable staff there, who supplied him with biographic information. They
                    would develop a lot of information which Castro used to flatter these visitors.
                    The Americans would come out with an incredibly favorable impression. Guy Vander
                    Jagt, the congressman, told me after meeting with Castro he felt like a 17 year
                    old girl who on her first date had been seduced and taken to bed. It was an
                    incredible technique that Castro had; it was both intimate knowledge of the
                    person with whom he was talking and then an unlimited store of time. He would
                    talk for hours and hours and then often at the end offer to drive them
                    personally to their hotel. He was very, very seductive in that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything you can add to the fascination with Castro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Castro was very soft spoken, when you met him. I met him about 17
                    times. We're used to seeing these television commentaries of him ranting and
                    raving in a public speech but personally he is very soft spoken. He's also good
                    with the ladies; for instance, when there were women there he would often play
                    up to them.Regarding his own situation, Castro lives in a number of houses. When
                    I was there, he lived in eight houses. He would move almost every night. The way
                    you'd know he was in a particular house was by observing the security people
                    around. Then he would move. One of his houses was right across the street from
                    the Ambassador's residence. Castro had one or several mistresses, one of whom
                    was his favorite English interpreter. When we spoke to her about Castro, she
                    would say the man is a God. She and other official Cubans would speak of him as
                    kind of a deity. They would treat him as a deity - in fact as Alexander the
                    Great was treated by his entourage. Castro, they say, tried to cultivate the
                    idea of reasonableness, of softness of character but his basic inclinations were
                    confrontational, particularly with the United States. He grew up in a time when
                    gambling, prostitution and American tourism dominated Cuba. When relations with
                    the U.S. appeared to be normalizing, he would always stimulate a crisis. This is
                    how the intervention of Ethiopia was described to me by members of Castro's
                    personal entourage. The U.S. opened the Interests Section in Havana in
                    August-September 1977. Then, the Cubans and Russians moved into Ethiopia in
                    December - Castro, in my judgment, wanted to prevent normalization with the
                    U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I remember when we first arrived in Havana, we talked to the Somalis. The Somalis
                    were very close to the Cubans and the Russians. All of a sudden the roles were
                    reversed. The Cuban leadership, Castro's entourage, told me that what happened
                    was Castro was fascinated by the Ethiopian revolutionary leader Mengistu. Castro
                    saw him as a man who wore a military uniform, a revolutionary like Castro
                    himself. Castro convinced the Soviets to shift their bets. Whether this is true
                    or self serving is not clear. But what is evident, is that the prospect for
                    normalization with the United States was there; the Americans opened up in
                    Havana. But three months later the Americans, Cubans and Russians are at each
                    others' throat. Despite the fact that we had dangled all this business about
                    lifting the embargo, and the influx of Cuban visitors from the so-called Cuban
                    community (the Cuban exiles in Miami) which created an inflow of foreign
                    exchange immediately, Castro threw this all to the winds. Whether the Soviets
                    told him to do this, or whether he convinced the Soviets to do this, it's hard
                    to know. But what we do know is that, in December 1977, after we moved in, there
                    was a change in the tone of our relationship with Cuba. After Soviet-Cuban
                    intervention in Ethiopia, the Carter administration could no longer be dangling
                    the prospect of embargo lifting there. The Cubans, for their part, began to
                    clamp down on our contacts. Pending appointment requests started to build up and
                    by the time I left Cuba in 1979, I had 45-50 outstanding appointment requests
                    which had not been granted. They were really tightening up on us. So to pursue
                    our tasks there, we began meeting more and more with the Soviets and Eastern
                    Europeans and talked about their economic ties with Cuba. But the tone with the
                    Cubans turned to confrontation and Castro had precipitated this. While this was
                    going on in Ethiopia, Castro was also putting money, goods into the support of
                    the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. At the end of my tour, I had a meeting with Osmany
                    Cienfuegos, a member of the Cuban Communist party Politburo at the time and very
                    close to Castro. He said, “You know, you have seen our hand in Nicaragua and
                    you're going to see it again soon in El Salvador and Guatemala.” He was telling
                    the truth, of course. That was the next phase in the confrontation.</p>
                <p>There are those such as Wayne Smith who defend the Cubans but the reality is that
                    the Cubans had a golden opportunity. They had said that Angola would be unique.
                    They had been offered implicitly the lifting of the embargo and yet they moved
                    against U.S. interests. They dispatched troops to Ethiopia. We used to see these
                    troops at the airports flying out there; it was really a rush operation. As the
                    Cubans began to clamp down and close off contact with us, we began to see more
                    and more of the Russians. They were very open about their economic relationship
                    with Cuba. They professed to have a disdain for Castro but they had a different
                    point of view regarding Fidel and his brother Raul. The Soviets generally would
                    tell us that they considered Raul to be a disciplined fellow whereas Fidel was
                    more emotional and problematical. It was clear that they preferred a succession
                    arrangement in which Raul would take over; he was, of course, head of the armed
                    forces. They would talk, for example, about Raul's wife, Vilma Espin. She
                    apparently in her youth was a very beautiful woman, so they would say, “Why do
                    you think Vilma married Raul as opposed to Fidel the great hero? He had a great
                    future. He was more disciplined.” That was certainly their hope.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>In the meantime, whether the Cubans instigated the Ethiopian intervention or the
                    Russians had, the Russians continued to upgrade Cuba's strength while we were
                    there.</p>
                <p>One interesting incident happened. I was at a reception once talking to a Cuban,
                    a senior Cuban, he was sort of in his cups. He said, “You know, we have a means
                    to launch a military strike against Washington.” “I said how's that?” He said,
                    “We have an airplane that can fly on a one way mission and bomb Washington.” I
                    said, “What are you talking? He said, “You'll see, you'll see.” So we sent this
                    little anecdote in a memorandum to Washington and got an alarmed massage back.
                    Somebody has to come down to Havana and speak to us personally. So they sent a
                    man down from INR (Dept. of State Intelligence and Research) and he said they
                    had detected a delivery of MIG-23 fighter aircraft. The MIG-23s, maybe would get
                    to Miami, maybe if you had a one way mission it might get up to Jacksonville,
                    Florida. Under certain scenarios, with external fuel tanks maybe a little
                    longer, but perhaps this is what they thought the Cuban was talking about. The
                    Soviets delivered MIG-23s and the reason they were considered particularly
                    dangerous was, not only the interceptor version delivered, but also the ground
                    attack version. They would be used to attack a ground target whether Washington
                    or Miami or whatever. So that was the subject of some concern. The
                    Administration made it public. They didn't know, however, how many of the ground
                    attack and how many of the interceptor versions had been delivered. Finally at a
                    crucial point of the crisis, the Cubans published a photo on the front page of
                    Verde Olivo, a Cuban military magazine, which showed a specific ground attack
                    version. It has a nose that tilts downward and you could count in the photo how
                    many ground attack aircraft and how many interceptors. This helped defuse the
                    crisis, but what it showed was the Soviets despite all this gossip about not
                    liking Castro and being discouraged by the amount of economic support he
                    required, continued to upgrade his inventory and facilitated actions which were
                    considered as provocative by the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>On another subject, when we arrived in Cuba, Castro had a number of American
                    citizens prisoners - many who were involved in early CIA rebellions or
                    assassination attempts and other things. Basically they had been held and
                    sentenced for many years. There was a presumption that when we opened up, Castro
                    would finally have to release some of these American prisoners. He also had some
                    hijackers from the U.S. there who lived freely. They hijacked American aircraft
                    to Cuba. First we started talking to the Cubans about the hijackers, some of
                    whom actually wanted to leave. One of them I remember was named Jesus Garland
                    Grant. He came into the Interests Section and asked to be repatriated to the
                    United States. We were finally able to get him released, and sent him to an
                    American prison. We received a letter later from an American prison thanking us
                    for sending him to a U.S. prison, despite having been permitted to live free in
                    Cuba. This was sort of an interesting commentary on life there. We also, more
                    seriously, had American political prisoners, one of whom committed suicide just
                    before we arrived there. Rafael Del Pino, who had been one of Castro's
                    collaborators during the revolution, had turned against them later. What was
                    told to us was, just before we opened the Interests Section, the Cubans put him
                    in an isolation cell. They began 24 hours a day playing very loud, loud music
                    and drove him mad. Finally he committed suicide just before we arrived. But we
                    had other prisoners there who were alive and we would visit them. Some of the
                    many prisoners were cooperating with the Cuban authorities, some of the
                    prisoners would not cooperate. The Cubans had earlier segregated common
                    criminals and political prisoners. Just before we arrived they changed the
                    regime so all prisoners had to wear the same uniforms. The real hardline
                    political prisoners refused to do that. So they just walked around in their
                    underwear for years; they were the hardest ones to get out; eventually they were
                    released much later. There was one prisoner who had somewhat cooperated and
                    since wore the uniform - Larry Lunt. He was a relative of the Belgian Royal
                    family actually. He'd been there a number of years and we were able to negotiate
                    finally his release. But a number of other political prisoners remained - we
                    used to visit them at the Combinado del Este Prison and talk to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given your background in Soviet affairs, did you have
                        contactwith the Russians and how many of them were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Basically our contacts were with the Soviet embassy and economic
                    mission but there were a lot more Russians there. On one occasion, we had a
                    visit from the Moiseyev Ballet. They brought in people from the Lourdes
                    monitoring station where they monitored U.S. communications. They had filled up
                    the auditorium, over 10,000 Russians were there. We essentially discovered after
                    we left a so-called Soviet Brigade. We found the Russians had had a Soviet
                    Brigade in Cuba since after the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved yet again going to Mexico City; that must have

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, I was made the Deputy Chief of the political section in Mexico
                    City. I was responsible for Mexican foreign relations in Mexico. One day, I
                    received a call from Washington from the Office of Assistant Secretary William
                    Bowdler. The Archbishop in El Salvador had been assassinated by some people. It
                    was later thought that right wing elements had killed the Archbishop. The
                    leftist groups had become quite active and since I had been in Cuba and had some
                    good rapport there, Bowdler asked that I go to El Salvador and try to find out
                    what these leftist groups were about. We had no contact with them. I flew down
                    to El Salvador one week after Archbishop Romero was killed, was picked up at the
                    airport, driven in at night by some people in the car with guns leaning out,
                    obviously a tense atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Through some of my press contacts from Mexico who were there, I asked to be
                    introduced to the leftist groups. I was first taken to the National University
                    of El Salvador. Within days of my arrival, they were announcing the formation of
                    what they called the FDR (Democratic Revolutionary Front) which was going to be
                    the political front of the leftist groups. I went in and I didn't want to make
                    myself too particularly conspicuous. When signing in I simply wrote Jon Glassman
                    - America. I went in there and I thought I was being very clever until people
                    came up and started photographing me. I thought that was rather strange. The
                    next day the leftist paper, which was the only one there, published my
                    photograph under the title of “CIA person attends the inauguration of FDR.”</p>
                <p>Later, as the days passed, we tried to get the word out that we wanted to meet
                    with the leftist people. The leftist groups said they had to consult and
                    subsequently the answer came back a few weeks later. They had a meeting in
                    Mexico among the groups and had decided they would not meet with me unless the
                    United States government made certain concessions such as breaking relations
                    with the Salvadoran government and other conditions that were obviously
                    unacceptable. One of the groups later offered to meet with me separately under
                    circumstances which I thought were rather dangerous. I wouldn't do it but,
                    notwithstanding that, I remained around El Salvador for a few weeks - about six
                    weeks actually and established some contacts with what they referred to as the
                    “progressive” elements of the Salvador military. The military had made a coup
                    against the previous dictator Romero, and there were some military people there
                    we would consider democratic elements. At this time, however, another coup
                    attempt took place led by far right elements led by Major Roberto D'Aubuisson.
                    Because of my contacts with the more moderate individuals in the military, we
                    were able to mobilize units of armed forces to resist the coup. The coup was put
                    down.</p>

                <p>The other thing we did on this first trip was to put together the business
                    groups. The leftists had tried to make inroads into particularly small business
                    operations, trying to establish a so-called united front, using some of the
                    things like small bus lines, small shopkeepers as a means to divide the moderate
                    non-guerrilla groups similar to a tactic they'd used in Nicaragua against
                    Somoza. We organized what we called the Alianza, which was a unit across the
                    business sector oriented against the guerrillas and that pretty much sustained
                    itself so the guerrillas never were able to do what they had done in Nicaragua.
                    Six or so weeks doing that, I went back to Mexico to resume my duties.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Subsequently, in January 1981, the Salvadoran guerrillas launched what they
                    called the “final offensive.” Their goal was to overthrow the Salvadoran
                    government before Reagan's inauguration because they sensed that when Reagan
                    came into power the Salvadoran regime would be backed by the U.S. government. So
                    they should try to achieve immediate success. I believe that on January 16,
                    1981, the reason I recall this, it was the last National Security Council
                    meeting of the Carter administration, Bowdler's people again called me and said
                    they would like me to go back to El Salvador and find out whether any foreign
                    groups were backing this final offensive. At that time U.S. Ambassador Robert
                    White was still there. He had been there during my first trip and I knew him
                    well, a very active person. He, however, had made a critical error at the
                    Carter-Reagan transition. He had done an interview with Newsweek in which he had
                    condemned Reagan which wasn't good. I went there, White assembled his country
                    team and asked that they help me. I said, “Look, the first thing I'm going to
                    do, I'm going to go visit each of the military and police elements of Salvador
                    and see what they've come up with, what kind of evidence they have re the
                    external ties of the guerrillas.” The CIA station chief said, “Oh, we have very
                    close relations with the General Staff, there's nothing else, nothing to learn.”
                    I said, “Oh, I just want to do it.” So I began calling on people, the Salvadoran
                    National Guard, the National Police, the Treasury Police, the joint staff, the
                    armed forces and one day I received a telephone call from Pat Lasbury Hall, a
                    consular officer. She said she had just come from National Police headquarters;
                    they just made an arrest of the propaganda commission of the ERP (The
                    Revolutionary Popular Army), which was one of the guerrilla groups. She said,
                    “Go on down there - see what's happening.” So I went down to National Police
                    headquarters, went and talked to Colonel Lopez Nuila, who was running the
                    police. He said, “Yes, we got these prisoners.” I said, “Did you pick up any
                    papers?” He said, “Oh, yes, we have lots of papers, always a bunch of papers.” I
                    said, “Why don't you just give me the papers.” So I just took all these
                    documents and I took them back to Mark Dion's house who was Embassy Deputy Chief
                    of Mission. I started going through the papers. I had seen some reports on
                    captured guerrilla documents in the past and I had read some DIA reports on
                    them. I knew that they used code names to identify places and one of them which
                    I had seen previously was Esmeralda (Emerald). I remembered a DIA report which I
                    had read in Mexico that said perhaps they were talking about an Ecuadorian port
                    called Esmeralda. Maybe this was a place where the guerrillas were bringing in
                    arms but I started reading these documents and I began seeing things which to me
                    were fairly obvious. For instance, the guerrilla documents referred to Lagos - I
                    knew they weren't talking about Nigeria. I knew that Nicaragua has two big lakes
                    - Lagos might be Nicaragua. The Esmeralda thing also began to emerge more and
                    more as a place where a lot of things were going on - movements to and through
                    Esmeralda. The question was what is Esmeralda. I started to read one document, I
                    noticed they had a meeting in Lagos which again, in my judgment was probably
                    Nicaragua with “Comrades from Esmeralda.” They had met with one person called
                    capital letter 'C,' then two little letters 'en,' and then capital 'F,' (C en F)
                    then with another person 'M. Br,' and then another person whose name now escapes
                    me. I remembered that, in Cuba, one of Castro's titles was Comandante en Jefe
                    Fidel Castro. I thought, perhaps they're referring to the Sandinista
                    inauguration ceremony that had taken place last year and “C en F” referred to
                    Comandante en Jefe Fidel Castro. I did a check and asked, what Cubans had
                    attended Sandinista inauguration ceremonies? Castro, of course, was there, but
                    the way they tipped it off and made it clear was that Miguel Brugueras who was
                    the Cuban ambassador in Panama (M.Br.) was also there. So it was clear that
                    Esmeralda was Cuba and, if you'd backtrack it through all the documents, then
                    you'd see how Cuba stood out. There were documents in there, for example, that
                    showed how the Secretary General of the Salvadoran Communist Party, a man named
                    Shafik Handal, had gone to Moscow and how they had sent him on to Viet Nam. Viet
                    Nam then sent their arms to “Esmeralda,” which sent them to “Lagos.” So what you
                    can see from these documents, later collected at military headquarters, was a
                    clear picture. What had happened was the Cubans had put together the Salvadoran
                    guerrilla groups. Then they had one of the representative groups go to Moscow,
                    the Russians had told them to go to Viet Nam to get help, the Vietnamese had
                    given them help, they had shipped the arms to Cuba which in turn shipped them to
                    Nicaragua, then in turn to El Salvador.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>When I figured this out, this was all on a Saturday, I told Mark Dion. He said,
                    “This is very important, we have to go see the Ambassador.” We went to
                    Ambassador White's residence, he said, “This is fantastic.” He said, “What a
                    Godsend, they're about to remove me as Ambassador for criticism. Now we will
                    send in a cable.” We have discovered that the Cubans are supporting this. You've
                    written up this very factual thing, but I'm going to write the summary of this
                    cable to make it more dramatic, emphasizing the guerrillas contacts with Castro,
                    Yasser Arafat, etc.” So he writes up the summary, gives it to me, we send it in.
                    It's a big thing because, if I'm not mistaken, this was a day or two after
                    Reagan's inauguration. White was to have been called on the carpet the following
                    Tuesday in Washington for his criticism of Reagan. So he got the cable off and
                    he departed El Salvador. Subsequently, I got a few more documents. Basically we
                    had the goods on the guerrillas and this became a very important moment because
                    it turned out that Haig, who had become the Secretary of State days before, had
                    wanted to dramatize Soviet involvement in overseas aggression. This tends to
                    confirm his thesis. White went to Washington but was fired. He wanted to be
                    named Ambassador to Sweden and they said, “No way, we'll send you as Consul
                    General to Bermuda but you'll never get an Ambassadorship,” and he turned sour
                    on the Administration. The reason this is of interest is because he denied
                    knowing subsequently from where I got the guerrilla documents. He, of course,
                    not only knew but wrote the summary on the cable which went in under his
                    signature. Wayne Smith, who we talked about before, was another person who said
                    he didn't know. But of course, he also knew since a cable had been sent to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>After these cables were sent, I collected the documents, and journeyed back to
                    Mexico. I got a call from Washington, saying, “The Secretary of State wants you
                    to come to Washington and to bring the documents.” By this time I'd accumulated
                    about 18 pounds of documents. So I came up to Washington in late January-early
                    February 1981. They'd formed a little working group - INR Phil Wilcox and Luigi
                    Einaudi were there, as were David Simcox and other Foreign Service Officers.
                    They were working up for Haig a Salvadoran White Paper. They wanted to merge
                    information from the documents and previously classified information, and put
                    out an expose. Haig's idea was to spread it internationally to discredit the
                    Soviets and to develop resistance to them. We began assembling the paper but,
                    before it was completed, Haig sent for Larry Eagleburger who was Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs. “Larry, you go to Europe - meet with the principal
                    Allies, meet with the North Atlantic Council, go to Germany, France, UK at the
                    Ministerial level and tell them what we found and how we have to confront the
                    Soviets in Central America.” Since I knew the most about the documents, I was
                    asked to accompany Eagleburger. So Eagleburger and I took off for Europe. This
                    was a pretty heavy thing for me. I was 37 years old and all of a sudden I was
                    having lunch and dinner with the foreign ministers in London, Paris and Bonn. By
                    the time we got to Brussels, however, the basic reaction to the mission was that
                    the Europeans said yes - we don't like the Soviets but the Soviet problem is
                    here, it's in the Middle East, it isn't in Central America.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>While we were out there Eagleburger sent a cable to Haig saying that he liked me.
                    Meantime in parallel, I had received an offer to join the Policy Planning Staff
                    at State under my old friend Paul Wolfowitz. And back in Washington the
                    Salvadoran White Paper was being written. The actual people who wrote the White
                    Paper are David Simcox and Luigi Einaudi with inputs from Philip Wilcox. They
                    wrote it in a kind of extravagant language using terms like “this is a textbook
                    case of communist aggression” which infuriated people on the left who thought
                    the Salvadoran rebels were land reformers. We got back from Europe and Haig
                    wanted to hold a press conference to release the White Paper. So they prevailed
                    on me since I knew the most about the documents to go out and be the spokesman.
                    I appeared before the press corps. A number of very complimentary articles were
                    initially written including one on the front page of The Washington Post
                    comparing me to “Smiley's People.” I was also written up in Time Magazine which
                    I thought was great. But this later proved not to be such a happy
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Months passed and the Administration geared up its efforts to help the Salvadoran
                    government. We sent down some military trainers and, unknown to us, a
                    counterattack began to shape up. Obviously our expose was a very damaging thing
                    to the Soviets and Cubans. Number one, what had become public was what was
                    supposed to have been a covert operation. The Soviets were taking the heat for
                    it. The Cubans were taking the heat for it and they didn't like it. Its was
                    causing great problems so certain things began to happen - for instance, the
                    newspaper Excelsior, the biggest paper in Mexico, ran a three part series on me
                    for three days in a row by a man named Manuel Buendia, who was on the Cuban
                    payroll (and was later murdered in Mexico for unrelated reasons). Basically, the
                    Cubans had done great research into my past, they talked about my time in
                    school, they invented a story about my attitudes and this and that, then the
                    bottom line after three days front page story in the biggest newspaper in Mexico
                    was that I was a professor of torture and that I had taught the Salvadorans how
                    to torture to produce the White Paper. This was a total fabrication, of course.
                    I said okay this was an attempt to discredit, but very interesting, it turns out
                    that virtually at the same the story was coming out in Mexico, Philip Agee, a
                    defector from the CIA, then residing under control of East Germany, published a
                    very closed paper which was later published in a book called 'White Paper
                    Whitewash' under Agee's name. This paper attempted to expose contradictions in
                    the White Paper. It was an attempt to divert attention to alleged detailed
                    discrepancies rather than engaging the total picture. When the Agee piece came
                    out, I was totally unaware. I received a call about four or five months after
                    the White Paper in June from a man named Jonathan Kwitny of The Wall Street
                    Journal. He wanted to interview me; fine I'd done many other interviews. He said
                    he wanted the interview to be not for attribution or background. When he came
                    in, he asked me a lot of detailed questions which I responded to. The article
                    appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, criticizing the White
                    Paper. He quoted me as saying that we stretched the facts too far. He used my
                    reaction to a particular detail to characterize my attitude to the whole
                    product. Haig saw the Journal article and was furious. He wanted me fired as it
                    appeared I had criticized a product I had played a part in producing. I issued a
                    statement that day pointing out that Kwitny had quoted out of context. The
                    Salvadoran White Paper was accurate, notwithstanding the problems we might have
                    with some of its language. The facts were true, the flow of arms had come from
                    Cuba and Nicaragua. Kwitny's story was damaging. The very next day, The
                    Washington Post published another huge article written by Karen De Young and Bob
                    Kaiser attacking details and exposing alleged mistakes. It didn't quote me by
                    name but again pointed out allegedly wrong details. Later we discovered that
                    both the Kwitny piece in the The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post
                    piece by Kaiser/De Young not only borrowed extensively from the Agee piece but
                    used very similar language without attribution. This disclosure appeared in some
                    of the right wing press which documented this. The words were almost identical
                    to the Agee piece. Frederick Taylor, who at that time was one of the editors of
                    The Wall Street Journal, ran an editorial piece saying, “Yes, Kwitny did have
                    access to the Agee piece; he did do it but he paid for xeroxing.” That was the
                    excuse no attribution was necessary because he paid for the xerox copying.</p>

                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, it was a violation of the ground rules. Furthermore, it was
                    inaccurate. It was a total misrepresentation. We put out a public statement the
                    very day by the Department press spokesman pointing that out. When I went up for
                    my ambassadorial confirmation hearings Senator Dodd asked about the White Paper.
                    I said, “Both Castro and others have confirmed that they provided arms to the
                    Salvadorans. It is now a matter of public record.”</p>

                <p>GLASSMAN: At that point Haig, in addition to dramatizing the Soviet and Cuban
                    action in Central America, wanted to do something about it. He said, “Cuba was
                    the source of a lot of the problems we were seeing in the world. We must go to
                    the source.” He named Bud McFarlane who was Counselor of the Department, as a
                    point man to do a paper and the object of the paper was to build a case for
                    military action against Cuba, probably invasion. McFarlane, other people in the
                    Department...Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Burt, and others were contributing. The
                    paper never was right, it was done in many, many versions. Finally the CIA took
                    dead aim at the paper. The CIA wanted to make the case that any invasion of Cuba
                    would involve massive American military casualties. They were not the only ones
                    who did not want the invasion to occur. There were differences in the
                    Administration, for instance, James Baker, who was Chief of Staff of the Reagan
                    White House, was very much against the invasion of Cuba, as was Tom Enders who
                    became the Assistant Secretary for Latin America. When we took our trip to
                    Europe with Eagleburger, Eagleburger had talked to Enders about going as
                    Ambassador to Moscow but Haig had called Enders and said, “You should take over
                    Latin America because you're a man who can get things done.” Enders had the mind
                    of a moderate in terms of military action and he also knew that James Baker, the
                    Chief of Staff, didn't really favor it, so he was very much against the
                    McFarlane effort. So you had a kind of internal conflict within the Department
                    with harder elements meaning, Wolfowitz, Burt, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Bud
                    McFarlane, against Enders, with the latter playing up to the Chief of Staff in
                    the White House, James Baker. After many versions of this paper, a decision was
                    made that they were not going to go forward with the invasion of Cuba. Once that
                    decision was made, the effort obviously became the need to contain the Cubans in
                    Central America. Tom Enders became the focal point of this effort. Enders had
                    two aspects of his policy. One, he wanted to generate military pressure against
                    the Sandinistas, who were the intermediate point for transferring the Cuban help
                    to Salvador. The idea would be to set up a military group (the Contras) to apply
                    pressure against Sandinistas. Meantime, he would try to engage in some type of
                    negotiating effort with them as well. To do both of these things required the
                    approval of Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Enders had interesting ways of carrying out his policy because he wanted to have
                    a great deal of control; he wanted to have some influence in the White House. He
                    started restricting decision making and access to information on the contra
                    track and military track. He formed something that became known as the RIG
                    (Restricted Interdepartment Group) and put his personal assistant Tony Gillespie
                    in charge. The group maintained liaison with the CIA which was represented by
                    Dwayne “Dewey” Clarridge, who was in charge of Latin American things. This
                    became the vehicle through which they would work with the Contras. In parallel,
                    they also began some attempts to negotiate with the Sandinistas. Again there was
                    a split within the Administration. Enders would have been satisfied probably if
                    the Sandinistas had agreed to cut off military support to the Salvadorans which
                    of course they were never prepared to do anyway, since they never admitted that
                    they were providing it. There were others, however, Wolfowitz, Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, others who wanted the Sandinistas to be removed from power. In
                    other words, restore democracy in Nicaragua. So Enders would pursue his
                    negotiating ploys, then there would be memos to Secretary Haig criticizing
                    Enders's negotiating course. Haig, by the way, while all this was going on, was
                    very suspicious of the White House. He felt that the White House was conspiring
                    against him. I remember several meetings where he would become bright red, beet
                    red, talking about how the White House was trying to undermine him. Another
                    facet of Enders' policy was an economic track - we worked on a Carribean Basin
                    Initiative which was to open the United States market to duty free entry from
                    the Central American/Caribbean countries, and also to provide some increased aid
                    to account to them.</p>
                <p>Enders was an interesting person; he was brilliant and at the same time extremely
                    arrogant and somewhat rude but he liked to have a little interplay and
                    challenge. He would have a staff meeting every day of his country directors in
                    which he allowed me as a representative of S and a fellow named Otto Reich, who
                    was the head of Latin American AID, to attend. We often had policy conflicts
                    with him. We would challenge him in front of his country directors. He would
                    enjoy it because he was a brilliant guy and liked to put us in our place
                    appropriately. We had some very interesting discussions. He was sort of a giant,
                    he suffered a defeat at one point. During these Nicaragua negotiations, a new
                    team took shape at the White House. A man named Judge William Clark, who had
                    been the Deputy Secretary of State, became the National Security Advisor. He
                    turned against Enders and Enders was removed, replaced by a man named Langhorne
                    “Tony” Motley, who actually continued more or less Enders' policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: December of 1983 you turned up as advisor to Senator
                        RicharStone. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: At that point, I was about ready to move over to the Atlantic Council
                    to spend a year. I received a telephone call from Larry Eagleburger and I went
                    over to see him. It turned out that the Administration, knowing that it had to
                    get funding for the Contras had run into problems in the Congress. They didn't
                    have a peace component in their policy, in other words they just had a military
                    component. They named former Florida Senator Richard Stone as a special
                    Presidential envoy but had him reporting to the Secretary of State. This later
                    proved to be rather complicating. What Stone wanted to do was to enlist the
                    Contras in a negotiating mode. They couldn't be just a military organization.
                    They had to have certain political reconciliation aims, then take those peace
                    proposals or plans to the Sandinistas in Managua. Second of all, he wanted to
                    open some contact with the Salvadoran guerrillas or their political fronts. The
                    first thing he did was set up a meeting in Panama where we went down and met
                    with the leaders of the Contras and some of the others and, basically, they
                    indicated their demands - democracy/human rights guarantees. We went to Managua
                    on several occasions and presented them to Daniel Ortega who was then leading
                    the Sandinistas. There were no positive signs on the part of Ortega, he wasn't
                    prepared to accommodate. We also started to reach out to the Salvadoran
                    guerrillas. That was made possible by President Belisario Betancur of Colombia.
                    He set up a meeting for us in Bogota with Ruben Zamora, who was one of the
                    political front men of the Salvadoran guerrillas. We met with him, a meeting, a
                    dramatic thing, and set up a later meeting which took place in San Jose, Costa
                    Rica with the heads of the various guerrilla political fronts. The meetings did
                    not achieve any substantial progress. In those meetings, the Salvadoran
                    representatives, the guerrilla representatives, remarked to me, “You did those
                    articles about us, you did the White Paper and used our documents.” There was no
                    give on the parts of these people while we were negotiating both with the
                    representatives of the Salvadoran guerrilla political fronts and also with the
                    Sandinistas. There was a lot of tension within the Department because Langhorne
                    “Tony” Motley, who had taken over Latin affairs, wanted to also pursue his own
                    negotiating. In fact, he was prepared to move a little beyond Stone in terms of
                    concessions to the Sandinistas.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Stone and I at one point, were down in Buenos Aires attending the presidential
                    inauguration of Alfonsin. George Bush was there in fact as the United States
                    Representative. We were going to head up from there to Caracas for some meetings
                    with the Venezuelan government. Then we were going into Managua for another
                    session with Daniel Ortega. We went into the Embassy in Buenos Aires on Monday
                    and were talking to John Bushnell who was the Deputy Chief of Mission. When we
                    told him we were heading up to Managua, he said, “That's funny, Tony Motley was
                    heading there himself. How can that be?” We called the National Security Council
                    and they didn't believe it. We said, “This must be a mistake.” We put in a call
                    to Larry Eagleburger. I said, “Larry, we understand Motley is headed for
                    Managua.” He said, “I don't know anything about it.” So we flew up to Caracas
                    and we called Eagleburger. He said, “Yes, well it turns out Motley is going in
                    there.” We said, “How can he go there when we're going to be there in two days
                    to conduct negotiations?” He said, “Well he's going to do it.” This is
                    happening; we have to make the best of this. Stone decided to cancel the trip to
                    Nicaragua because he presumed correctly that Motley was putting other things on
                    the table. How can you come in with a different program, so we went back and
                    said, “This is just unacceptable. How can you be trying to do something like
                    this?” The Department said, “Well it will never happen again.” It continued to
                    happen and it became clear that Motley was proceeding with his efforts to
                    negotiate with the Sandinistas at the time when Stone was supposed to be doing
                    the same thing. So one day Stone went to Secretary George Shultz and said, “Mr.
                    Secretary, either you restrain Motley or I resign; here's my letter.” So Shultz
                    said, “I have to think about this.” We went on the road again. I think in
                    Caracas we got a message, which said Shultz had accepted Stone's resignation.
                    Stone called Bud McFarlane, “Hey sorry, I didn't know that, Shultz jumped the
                    gun.” Stone was basically hung out to dry in that case and Motley basically took
                    over the lead negotiating. An interesting episode of crossed wires and crossed
                    intentions and how a Presidential envoy becomes undone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Stone episode had led you to some broader conclusions
                        whawas going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, the prime emphasis on the Stone mission was to ensure that
                    congressional funding continued for the Contras. That's not to say that the
                    Administration wouldn't have accepted the peaceful conclusion if the Sandinistas
                    had stopped helping the Salvadorans and transformed their internal structure.
                    But that clearly wasn't in the cards and in fact did not come into the cards
                    until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the inability to get outside support.
                    The Stone mission was a needed component but the reason it didn't prosper was
                    because both the Soviets and Cubans were willing to back the Sandinistas in
                    their effort to undermine El Salvador. The United States was unwilling to
                    intervene directly with its own troops. We provided training, unarmed trainers
                    but were not willing to intervene with our own troops and unable to give
                    sufficient help to the Salvadoran armed forces so they could prevail militarily
                    over the guerrillas. The deeper lesson in terms of bureaucratics, of course, is
                    that you have to have a coherent policy in which you don't have two elements
                    trying to negotiate with a foreign government and, if you're going to have a
                    presidential envoy, you have to identify very clearly where the reporting
                    responsibility lies so there's not a competition between the Secretary of State
                    and the White House to run these sorts of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were suddenly without a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Yes, we disbanded Stone's office and I was then asked by a political
                    fellow who was going to be named Ambassador to accompany him as Deputy Chief of
                    Mission. This became impossible because at that point I was under rank for a
                    senior officer's position. Secretary of State Shultz, however, said, “Well we
                    can't break the system, can't make him a DCM but we should do something for this
                    fellow.” So they made me Country Director for Australia and New Zealand, which
                    was thought to be a nice quiet backwater, but, fortunately or unfortunately, as
                    the case may be, New Zealand at this point launched its so-called “nuclear ships
                    policy” under which they prohibited the entry into New Zealand of either nuclear
                    armed or powered ships. This was a big challenge to the United States Navy
                    because in terms of weaponry at least at that point, we followed a policy which
                    we did not declare whether ships had nuclear weapons on board. “No confirm, no
                    deny policy,” I think it was called. This was a challenge to the United States
                    Navy because of our neither confirm or deny policy which allowed the Navy to
                    maintain access in states such as the Scandinavians, Japan and others which
                    would not permit entry of declared nuclear weapons. New Zealand had an
                    importance to the United States particularly the Navy that went beyond its
                    locality. It was a question of our global ability to project power with ships
                    which might have on board nuclear ammunition, mines, torpedoes, bombs.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>What happened was an effort to negotiate New Zealand back from this ban. New
                    Zealand sent to Washington Ambassador Wallace “Bill” Rowling, who had been a
                    former Prime Minister. We developed with him a possible negotiated settlement
                    under which we would try a gradual return to access allowing less difficult
                    ships in first. That is, ships that clearly didn't carry nuclear weapons and
                    then building up step by step. There was a sense that the New Zealand Government
                    might accept this and we dispatched a ship to New Zealand called the USS
                    Buchanan. The New Zealanders appeared ready to accept but Prime Minister Lange,
                    after dispute with the Labor Party caucus, turned it down. So at this point, we
                    were in a state of confrontation with New Zealand. Later Lange was brought to
                    Washington, where he met with Weinberger and Shultz. Weinberger particularly
                    pressed Shultz to be very hard. Again the lower level bureaucracy was willing to
                    do a step by step type of approach, but Shultz, at Weinberger's urging, was
                    tough. (Although Shultz and Weinberger fought on many occasions they were of one
                    mind.) Shultz said, “No way - we're not going to accommodate you at all.” At
                    this point, decisions were made to undertake sanctions against New Zealand. The
                    reason this was interesting and controversial was New Zealand and Australia were
                    allies of the United States - a defense Alliance which had existed since the
                    beginning of the Cold War years, part of the chain of alliances circling the
                    globe. They cooperated with us very closely. We shared most of our intelligence
                    with them, at the same level as closest allies such as Britain. We had defense
                    exercises with them. They were an integral part of the Western defense
                    community. So before invoking these various sanctions, we had a secret meeting
                    with Prime Minister Lange. With me was a Foreign Service Officer named Bill
                    Brown who later became Ambassador to Israel. He and I went to Los Angeles and
                    met with Prime Minister Lange at the home of the Consul General of New Zealand.
                    We read off to him the sanctions that would be taken against New Zealand if they
                    persisted in their policy - including comprehensive cut-off of intelligence, an
                    end of all defense cooperation, joint exercises and sharing of defense
                    technology. While we were there Lange kept staring over our heads, we couldn't
                    understand what was happening. Lange was a very fat man, he probably weighed
                    about 250-300 pounds and we couldn't figure out why he kept staring over our
                    heads. We turned around and there was a plate of pastries on the shelf. Lange
                    was very dismissive of these sanctions. He said that, if he didn't get
                    intelligence, it's more time to read the comic paper when he is sitting in
                    Parliament. He said these things don't interest him at all. Meanwhile back in
                    Washington they brought in some people from the Prime Minister's office in New
                    Zealand who had been involved in the intelligence exchange. The Agency brought
                    them over and one man whose name now escapes me, when told about the sanctions,
                    began sobbing. These senior New Zealand people had been very much involved from
                    the beginning in inter-allied cooperation.</p>

                <p>It was felt at that time, however, that the sanctions had to be spelled out very
                    clearly, not so much because of New Zealand's policies, but to give a lesson in
                    Europe and Japan about what happens if they precluded the entry of the so-called
                    nuclear ships. Finally the meeting we had out in California with the
                    Australians; we reached an agreement with the Australians who were pushing us
                    very hard to take action against New Zealanders because the Australian Labor
                    Party felt that this could be very contagious within their own party if New
                    Zealand policy was allowed to stand without sanction. It was agreed that we
                    would suspend New Zealand from the ANZUS alliance. I think it's probably unique
                    in the history of the broad Western alliance system. At the meeting it was
                    decided that New Zealand was suspended. All the sanctions went into force and
                    held for over a decade.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: It was interesting, there was a sense that with the embassy here in
                    town we had a relationship working to solve this. Ambassador Rowling was really
                    trying to solve it. Had the Labor Party been as it was before, it would have
                    been solved, but a radical group had taken the party. Lange himself had been an
                    anti-Vietnam war activist, there were people who were very radical and someone
                    who had been tied up with Soviet front organizations who had taken control of
                    the Labor Party. At that point Lange himself was not leader, he felt he had to
                    bend to his own caucus.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Major change of scene in 1987. When you went to Kabul,
                        that waquite a plum as an assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: I don't know if it was a plum. I volunteered to go and was able to
                    study Dari (Afghan Persian) along with Russian for a year. The idea as you know
                    was to report from Kabul on the Soviet intentions. The Soviets had come in, in
                    1979 - this is eight years later. They had about a hundred twenty thousand
                    troops in Afghanistan, many of them headquartered in the city of Kabul. The
                    United States and the other Western nations maintained embassies there. They
                    were vehicles for reporting what the Soviets were doing and on the success of
                    the Afghan Resistance. The reason the Soviets allowed the Western embassies to
                    remain was their hope that over time the Western powers would recognize that a
                    communist regime was permanent, would normalize relations. That was their gain
                    from all this. We went in there and there were about twenty Americans. We were
                    under fire constantly from the Mujaheddin who were bombarding the city with 60
                    to 250 ground-to-ground rockets a week. In 1985, the United States had provided
                    the rebels with Stinger surface-to-air missiles. They were taking a healthy toll
                    of Soviet helicopters and aircraft. There was a very interesting atmosphere in
                    Kabul. The Soviets would be flying in supplies constantly because the road was
                    often interdicted - they would come in all night. All night long this infernal
                    roar as the Russian planes would come in one after another. They had a sort of
                    AWAC observation plane over the city all night long. In the old Ambassador's
                    residence where I lived, I would lock myself into a steel room every night and
                    then we would radio communicate with the Embassy. Electric power was going out
                    all the time as the Mujaheddin would blow up some of the power plants or power
                    lines but these were always restored. When we arrived there, the CIA told us
                    that the Pakistanis were running the operation and the rebels would finally
                    definitely cut out the electric supplies which they never succeeded in doing.
                    One thing we saw in Afghanistan was that frequently the reports which the
                    Pakistani Army Intelligence Service (the ISI) would convey to the American
                    Embassy Islamabad were much more optimistic than the actual results we could see
                    upon the ground. Nonetheless, the Mujaheddin were exercising strong
                    psychological pressure. We would send in the weekly situation report on the war.
                    The way we were able to do this was we would interview, when I say interview,
                    our officers would go out and talk to Afghan storekeepers and also talk to
                    embassy employees. Because the Afghans had an extended family network, we were
                    able to gain on a weekly basis reports of how the war was going in every one of
                    the provinces and cross check them and we would send in an unclassified report
                    which would go to Islamabad and it would be rebroadcast by both the BBC and the
                    Voice of America into Afghanistan. People who were out there fighting would know
                    how the war was going nationally. The British did the same thing and we would
                    coordinate our reports with them every week as we worked with the other NATO
                    representatives.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: No, it just simply said that in, say, Nangarhar province, a Mujaheddin
                    group under Saladin or something, had realized an attack on a Soviet convoy and
                    three trucks were destroyed. In addition to talking to the people we would send
                    an officer out on the periphery of the city where the Soviet bases were and we
                    would report when they were moving out on military operations, in which
                    directions. We would also take photographs of Soviet military equipment. A lot
                    of very dangerous stuff was done there with our people driving in the middle of
                    the Russian convoys. Pulling in the car in the middle and taking photographs of
                    the armor below the view of the driver and some standing at the end of the
                    airport taking shots of aircraft/helicopters landing. So there was a lot of wild
                    stuff going on.</p>
                <p>In addition, we talked to the Soviet and Eastern European Ambassadors. At this
                    time, in the late 1980s, a lot of the Eastern European Ambassadors were very
                    independent so they would get briefed from the Soviets and they would provide us
                    detailed debriefing so we were getting a very good picture of what the Soviets
                    were telling their allies.Ambassador Nikolai Yegorychev was the Soviet
                    Ambassador during a great portion of my tour. He was the former First Secretary
                    of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party. He was a very important man
                    under Khrushchev but had been removed and had been out for a long time, had been
                    brought back in and by this time was a very hard line guy. He was constantly
                    conveying threats that, if the United States continued to supply Stinger
                    missiles, they would take revenge - some patriotic Afghans would shoot down
                    American planes bringing supplies to Pakistan. When an aircraft carrying
                    Pakistani President Zia al-Haq, and American Ambassador Arnie Raphel blew up in
                    mid-air he came to see me, the only time he actually visited the American
                    Embassy. The Soviet Ambassador denied to me the Soviets had anything to do with
                    this. I asked him if the Afghan Communists had anything to do with it. He said,
                    “I don't know.” I can tell you that the night Zia's plane was downed, the Afghan
                    communist troops were celebrating, firing shots across the sky, really
                    celebrating the death of Pakistani President Zia. They thought this was the key
                    to a future victory.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us an idea of the size of your
                        mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Initially 20 people, then we were reduced to ten. As these rockets were
                    coming in, there was obviously fear that Americans would be killed. Sometimes
                    there were some spectacular things happening in the city. Once the Resistance
                    hit the ammunition dump at the airport, a Soviet ammunition dump; we were only a
                    mile away. There was the most incredible explosion you can imagine. Flames going
                    a thousand feet into the air, not smoke but flames, shells exploding and going
                    everywhere. We were all on top of the embassy and the Marines were cheering. I
                    said, “You shouldn't cheer because they're going to start hitting us next.”
                    Washington understood, of course, that our situation was dangerous. It was less
                    dangerous than you might think, however, because the city is six miles wide. So
                    you fire 60 or 250 rockets into the city with kill radius of maybe, say, 30
                    yards or so and in that six mile-wide city a lot of people will survive. And at
                    no time were any Americans injured while we were there even though we were
                    sitting next to Radio Afghanistan. One occasion I remember we were having dinner
                    in the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese at that point were on our side. We were
                    having dinner for our departing DCM when a rocket hit right next door on the
                    French Embassy. The wife of the Chinese Ambassador leaped to the side of one of
                    our officers but we were fortunate nothing happened. On another occasion, a
                    fight broke out behind the Embassy between the two regime factions. The Afghan
                    Communist troops at the Presidential Palace and their rivals were firing mortars
                    back and forth across the city, just an incredible thing to watch. No one was
                    hurt.</p>
                <p>When Bush was elected and was inaugurated, the Soviets had by then signed the
                    Geneva agreement which pledged them to pull out bFebruary 1989. There was fear
                    in Washington that, if we remained, the Mujaheddin would come in and kill all
                    whites including us. Most of us in the Embassy had beards, which distinguished
                    us from the Russian troops. The Russian troops were only permitted to have
                    mustaches, except for the Spetsnaz, the Russian Green Berets. We had beards to
                    look a little bit different. There was the sense that if the Mujaheddin came in,
                    they would kill all foreigners. So in the meantime, the CIA produced green
                    armbands with the inscription “Allahu Akbar”- God is Great. We were going to
                    wear them, but the Administration got very nervous and finally ordered us to
                    evacuate the post. We were burning all our documents. We arranged for a charter
                    flight from the Afghan communist airline by paying them $10,000. James Baker,
                    the new Secretary of State, said, “It isn't quick enough.” They wanted us to
                    leave more quickly and sent in an Indian Airline plane. When we said we were
                    going to evacuate, our local employees got very upset because they thought they
                    were going to be possibly killed. So we were instructed by the State Department
                    to pay them six months salary (about $80,000), which we paid them and committed
                    to come back and pay them and which people did over the years.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The embassy has been closed since February 1989. When we left, we moved all these
                    special armored vehicles into the basement (the vehicles had port holes for
                    automatic weapons, gas dispensers). We had metal containers made for everyone's
                    possessions and we took them to the airport to meet this Indian Airline plane
                    that was coming in. At the airport, the Afghan Communists were insulting us,
                    calling us cowards and all kinds of things were happening. Finally we loaded our
                    possessions and got on the plane and, after almost running into a Soviet plane
                    coming in, we got out to India. Just before leaving, I had a ceremony at the
                    monument honoring the deceased Ambassador Dubs who had been killed in a hostage
                    taking incident, and I had an American flag walking out and that picture
                    appeared on the front page of The Washington Post. When we arrived at New Delhi
                    Airport, we were going to have a press conference and Baker sent a message
                    saying he didn't want a press conference because he didn't like the photo
                    because it reminded him of Ambassador John Gunther Dean when he had withdrawn
                    from Cambodia carrying an American flag. He said, “It looked like we had
                    surrendered rather than won.” Anyway, we held the press conference. Later, we
                    brought back a flag. We had several flags. One we gave to Baker, which is still
                    in the State Department, to be returned whenever we go back. I also took one out
                    to President Reagan in California, gave him a flag which had flown on the day of
                    the Soviet invasion and the day when we left which coincided with the Soviet
                    troop withdrawal.</p>

                <p>GLASSMAN: Very helpful, we talked to both Ambassador Yegorychev and Vorontsov who
                    succeeded him during this time. The Soviets were also threatening, saying they
                    would not be pulling out but we were able to observe in various ways their
                    preparation for pulling out so we didn't have to believe what they were telling
                    us. Other things happened there; Kabul was a city under siege. Only about eight
                    kilometers, outside the city, there was a place called Karga Lake. The Soviets
                    had a paratroop detachment out there on top of the hill. Below the hill was the
                    old golf course which had been pock marked by rockets and mortar rounds, with
                    holes out there six to seven feet wide. We would go out there just to have a
                    little recreation. Sometimes there would be firefights across the lake with
                    Mujaheddin who were across the way. One time, The New York Times correspondent
                    was in there and he'd been told by Najibullah and the Afghan communist
                    authorities that the war was over. I said, “We'll take you 15 minutes outside
                    Kabul and show you it's not the case.” We went up there, shooting started and he
                    believed us. One time we were up there at Karga Lake and a BBC film crew was
                    being held by Soviet paratroopers. It turned out that this film crew had seen
                    the Soviets fishing in the lake with hand grenades and the Soviets didn't take
                    kindly to that. I told the Soviets that, “These guys will just turn over their
                    video tape and let them go on their way.” and they were ready to do that. I left
                    and came back 45 minutes later and they were still there. The British Charg�
                    d'Affaires had shown up and some other diplomats were there. A Soviet Lieutenant
                    Colonel said, “Look we're going to take these people in to talk with General
                    Varennikov,” who was the head of the Soviet operational group in Afghanistan. He
                    said, “You diplomats get on your way. We're not interested in you.” We diplomats
                    were standing there and said, “No, we don't want the journalists to be taken off
                    separately, we're going to be with them.” The Soviet Colonel said, “Okay you can
                    be with them, we'll take you all in then.” So he called up three tanks and he
                    lined up all the cars, the diplomatic cars, and then lined up one tank in the
                    beginning, one tank in the middle, one tank in the end, then we start motoring
                    with them. I rode with the Soviet Colonel, who was telling me how discouraged
                    they were in Afghanistan. He said, “We're going to take you to see General
                    Varennikov,” which was great because I had never seen General Varennikov. We
                    went about 15 kilometers around the edge of the city and were off the main road.
                    We came to a high-rise building over there and he said, “Wait here.” We waited
                    there about an hour and then it came down from headquarters that General
                    Varennikov had decided to make a gesture of good will. He decided to release
                    everyone, but this was great because this was the headquarters of the 40th
                    Soviet Army. We, the United States, had never known where it was located. So of
                    course we went back later, took pictures of the approaches. After that, it was
                    under constant attack by the Mujaheddin the rest of the war.</p>

                <p>GLASSMAN: No, we were banned by the State Department as were the other Western
                    powers from dealing with the Afghan communist government; the position was this
                    is a puppet regime, so the only official contact we were allowed to have was
                    with the Protocol Department of the Afghan Foreign Ministry which would give us
                    customs permits and things like that. We would never talk policy with them at
                    all. Najibullah had been a physician who was in charge of the Afghan secret
                    police. He was reputed to be a person who had developed new techniques to keep
                    prisoners alive under torture and I can tell you that torture was occurring
                    because they had several prisons in Kabul. One was right in the central part of
                    town. You could park outside and hear screaming in the night as people were
                    being tortured. Najibullah was a beastly fellow.</p>
                <p>One of the worst things that happened while we were there was, as you may recall,
                    that the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf had shot down by mistake an Iranian
                    passenger plane. The USG determined that the Iranians had sent out teams to get
                    revenge. One of the teams was sent to Afghanistan in an attempt to kill us, and
                    we were instructed by the State Department to approach the Soviets for
                    protection. You can understand the irony of this, because here we were paying
                    all this money to arm the Afghan resistance and we had to approach the Soviets
                    for protection. I forget whether Yegorychev or Vorontsov was the Ambassador but
                    they said they would be happy to talk to the Afghan Communist Government, which
                    they did and from then on whenever I went out of the embassy I had to be
                    accompanied by a detachment of Afghan communist soldiers with rifles who went
                    with me. They were on me like glue the rest of my time there.</p>

                        DeputNational Security Advisor for Vice President Quayle..</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: When Baker ordered us to be evacuated, I went back to the State
                    Department and went to see George Vest who was then the Director General of the
                    Foreign Service and he said, “You did a wonderful job there and I'd like you to
                    choose where you'd like to be Ambassador.” He said, “You think about it, go to
                    Larry Eagleburger and tell him.” So I decided I wanted to be Ambassador to
                    Panama. I went to Larry Eagleburger said that I was prepared to be Ambassador to
                    Panama and he said, “Well I'll talk to the Secretary and call you back.” He
                    never called back. In any event, I received a parallel offer to go over to the
                    White House to be the Deputy Assistant of National Security Affairs for the
                    newly inaugurated Vice President, Dan Quayle, who I did not know. I had never
                    even heard of him. I was in Afghanistan when his nomination was announced. I had
                    to look him up in the biographical book of Senators. I went over to the White
                    House and it turned out to be a good experience because the Vice President had
                    worked on the defense side, held all kinds of hearings on anti-ballistic missile
                    defense and missile proliferation, but never had really worked on the foreign
                    policy side. My job was to suggest with whom he should meet, and to brief him.
                    In the White House, people are very much rushed from meeting to meeting, so
                    often I would only have an opportunity of perhaps five minutes to brief him
                    before a meeting. I found that, based on this very rushed preparation, he could
                    really carry on the conversation, make the points needed. So despite the
                    reputation of not being a deep thinker, I thought he was quite competent. We had
                    to brief him for his meetings with the National Security Council and prepare and
                    accompany him on trips to about 42 countries. One of the things, thinking about
                    our old acquaintance Daniel Ortega, we were once going to Latin America and
                    Quayle decided to make Latin America one of his causes. We were meeting with
                    President Carlos Andres Perez in Venezuela and with Felipe Gonzalez the Prime
                    Minister of Spain. The discussion centered on how to convince Ortega to accept
                    the results of the Nicaraguan election, in which Violeta Chamorro was elected,
                    so we hit on a scheme. Carlos Andres Perez and Felipe Gonzalez invited Ortega on
                    their plane to fly down to a Presidential inauguration we were attending in
                    Chile. We then met with Daniel Ortega down in Chile. He agreed to surrender
                    authority that opened the way to the democratic transition in Central America.A
                    lot of interesting competition going on between Baker who was Secretary of State
                    and Quayle. The latter was a real conservative and Baker viewed him as a rival
                    for the succession to Bush. Accordingly, some of the trips we were planning were
                    constrained. For instance, Dan Quayle never went to the Soviet Union because of
                    objections from Baker. Mrs. Quayle went, but Quayle was kept away from there.
                    Quayle's staff was a little more open to change - he met with a lot of Eastern
                    Europeans who were turning away from communism in the beginning of the 1989
                    transition. Also Quayle's staff met with some of the Russians closest to
                    Yeltsin. At that point, Brent Scowcroft, the President's National Security
                    Advisor, would not allow Bush or other people to meet with the Yeltsin people.
                    The senior White House team had bet that Gorbachev was going to emerge
                    triumphant. The reason I mention that is that when we went with Mrs. Quayle to
                    Moscow, Mrs. Quayle met with Raisa Gorbachev, Gorbachev's wife. In the course of
                    that meeting, Raisa started sobbing and just broke down completely in the
                    meeting. She said, “No one understands us here in Moscow. They don't understand
                    what my husband's trying to do.” And we of course sent this into the Department
                    as the first indication that Washington would consider credible. Gorbachev was
                    really on the rocks, of course, and was soon to fall, so that was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Another Quayle contribution came just before the Europe 1992 exercise. He got
                    Bush interested in the idea of having an economic initiative for Latin America.
                    This became the Enterprise for the Americas initiative which was very far
                    reaching.</p>
                <p>Quayle was a good man and was extremely honest. His inclinations were more
                    advanced than those of Scowcroft and Baker. One crisis that has been written
                    about was the Philippine coup attempt. When Bush was heading overseas on a trip
                    and Scowcroft was with him, I went over to a meeting that was taking place in
                    the White House Situation Room chaired by Bob Gates who was Deputy National
                    Security Advisor. A coup was taking place in the Philippines against Corazon
                    Aquino so they were trying to figure out what to do. It seemed to me that with
                    Bush gone we ought to get the Vice President in. So I called him up and he came
                    down and took control of the meeting. In the course of that meeting an urgent
                    call was received, the Philippine air force is about to take off to bomb the
                    presidential palace: JCS chairman, Colin Powell was up on the video conference
                    screen. Secretary of Defense Cheney for some reason hadn't come in. Powell said,
                    “We can establish a cap, we'll send up the American fighters and they could
                    threaten to shoot down any Philippine plane that takes off.” This was a good
                    idea and Quayle, of course, agreed to that. They called Bush on the plane and he
                    agreed as well. Subsequently some people said that Quayle played the leadership
                    role. I can tell you as a witness that Colin Powell had the key idea but Quayle
                    was chairing the meeting. He gave it leadership, he sanctioned the idea and
                    contacted Bush.</p>
                <p>Q: A new biography apparently has revealed a recognition at the time by President
                    Bush that he had made a mistake in selecting Mr. Quayle. Did you see any
                    reflection of this? Did you see any of the interplay between the two?</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: On the contrary, I had been told that quote refers to the announcement
                    of Quayle naming as opposed to his selection. The relationship between Quayle
                    and Bush was reasonably close - they had lunch every week faithfully whenever
                    Bush was in the city. They would never miss this. They would have lunch for an
                    hour, hour and a half and we would prepare Quayle with issues that should be
                    brought up in this presidential meeting. Bush respected Quayle because Quayle
                    had been a Senator, he was the only person at that time in the White House with
                    congressional experience. So Quayle really played a key role in advising Bush on
                    how Congress would react. I remember one instance, for example, when we were
                    advised that support for the Cambodian resistance would not be possible in
                    Congress. Quayle said quite the contrary and he got on the phone himself and
                    started calling people. They came over to our side. Bush certainly had the
                    option of dropping Quayle for the second term, something that was booted around
                    the White House and discussed, but Bush never did. The reason he didn't do it, I
                    believe, was because his initial naming of Quayle responded to the fact that he
                    (Bush) had a reputation of a kind of liberal with the Republican party. He
                    wanted somebody from the right wing and Quayle was that and he was a traditional
                    conservative Republican, very much connected with the pro-life movement and
                    religious fundamentalists and Bush wanted that. He didn't anticipate the
                    negative reaction to Quayle's military service. Quayle became a permanent
                    target. Once that happens, you can't help stepping on land mines. I remember
                    once we were in Chile and we were having lunch in a restaurant and they had some
                    folk dancers down below. I said to the Vice President, “Why don't you come
                    down?” On the way, he and Mrs. Quayle stopped in a gift store and they made
                    jokes about one of these dolls there and this became a cause c�l�bre for them.
                    Ann Devroy, one of The Washington Post correspondents, was there and they played
                    it up. It was just a little joke. The point being, that once you are a target
                    it's very hard to escape from that. Quayle, of course, is a media target but
                    he's a smart man and despite his light blue eyes which some people characterize
                    as deer-in-the-headlights, he's quite clever and he has very good instincts and
                    very good knowledge of the Congress. In my judgment, on foreign trips and
                    meetings with foreigners, he always did the right thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to educate him so to speak on the Foreign
                        Servicand perhaps overcome the resistance he might have had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: He was happy with the Foreign Service. Since I was a career Foreign
                    Service Officer, we used the State Department very much. The State Department
                    was the key to all our trips and all our meetings. In order to circumvent the
                    bureaucracy, we often told the desk officers to send to us directly their raw
                    product so we could use it fast. In the White House, there is generally a very
                    bad view of the State Department both for ideological reasons or because they're
                    not quick. This is one of the reasons why the advent of the fax machine gave the
                    White House for the first time a way to circumvent the bureaucracy and use the
                    State Department to full advantage. Quayle generally liked the people. He always
                    took the State Assistant Secretary on board Air Force Two. On the aircraft,
                    there's a round table and, before we would arrive at a location, we'd have the
                    Assistant Secretary, the National Security Council person who handled the
                    region, and the Vice President's staff sit around the table with the VP and
                    discuss what we were going to do at each stop. It worked pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An even greater reward was your 1991 to 1994 tour as
                        ouAmbassador to Paraguay. How did that come about? Your choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: We were traveling around different places and we came to Paraguay. The
                    Ambassador there had suggested that someone visit because no White House person
                    since Nixon had ever been in Paraguay since the 1950s. There was a great deal of
                    controversy in fact. The CIA came over to the White House and specifically
                    briefed Quayle because the President of Paraguay at that time was a man named
                    Andres Rodriguez who was an Army General. He was generally thought to have been
                    a sponsor/cooperator in narco trafficking. In fact the French Connection (the
                    movie), the Frenchman who was behind that had lived in Paraguay and Rodriguez
                    was accused of having protected him. So CIA came over and said it's not a good
                    thing to go but the American Ambassador said that it's really important to back
                    the transition to democracy. So we went down there and when we went there it was
                    very strange. Rather than having our business meeting in the office, Rodriguez
                    took us out on the Presidential yacht. We're sitting out there in the middle of
                    the Paraguay river and he had his drug czar brief us on the war against drugs.
                    The drug czar was telling us all the things they were doing and Rodriguez at one
                    point in the meeting became bored and he said that's enough. He said “Mr. Vice
                    President do you know what our policy is towards drug trafficking? The Vice
                    President said, “What is it?” Rodriguez said when we catch a drug trafficker,
                    “We cut off his head. That's our policy.”</p>
                <p>So I was sort of intrigued by this rather strange country. I talked to the State
                    Department about the possibility of going there and I was put up by the State
                    Department as a nominee. The White House had another political appointee to be a
                    candidate and the Vice President on my behalf talked to Bush, “Please don't send
                    a political appointee. Jon has worked here, he is a Foreign Service Officer, let
                    him go.” And I was able to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>When I went up for my hearing, as I mentioned, Chris Dodd was primed on the
                    Salvadoran White Paper. He raised it in the hearings. I cited many quotations
                    from Castro and others saying that they had indeed provided arms to Salvadorans.
                    Senator Dodd said, “Fine.” The Senate confirmed me unanimously, so I went to
                    Paraguay and discovered while I was there a little bit more about the
                    country.</p>
                <p>It produced cotton and had an abundance of electric power. One of its primary
                    features is that it served as a kind of entrepot for contraband entry into high
                    tariff countries such as Argentina and Brazil which are its neighbors. One of
                    the principal functions of the military was to protect this traffic and derive
                    protection payments for this. In this contraband traffic, in addition to
                    whiskey, cigarettes, perfume, electronic goods, and computers, we kept hearing
                    persistent reports that narcotics were included. In Paraguay, there's no
                    cultivation of narcotics but it's immediately adjacent to Bolivia which is one
                    of the two principal coca sources in the world, and we of course were trying to
                    press the Paraguayans to control this traffic. They said all the right things,
                    they said they were doing it but we came to notice procedures were notably below
                    that of their neighbors. For instance, one of my years there, the Brazilians
                    seized seven tons of cocaine, the Argentines had seized one ton and the
                    Paraguayans had seized 47 kilos. They were seizing a lot of marijuana which was
                    a lot less valuable commodity, so we would bring this up with Rodriguez, urge
                    him to cooperate and he would say the right things again but again, but it
                    looked like they were turning a blind eye to the trafficking. We were later to
                    discover exactly how this contraband traffic worked on electronics. They would
                    bring it in from Miami, break it down in smaller loads, drive them out in trucks
                    to the clandestine air strips in the eastern part of Paraguay where they were
                    put in warehouses and re-pack the smaller lots, which were put on small planes
                    which were then going into the outskirts of Sao Paulo and Rio, then transported
                    over to Argentina as well. Now in Brazil the traffickers, Nigerians and others,
                    would then transfer it into West Africa and then move it into Europe as
                    well.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting transit route.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Rodriguez, the President, had overthrown the 35 year dictator Stroessner. He had
                    been clearly part of Stroessner's group, one of his daughters was married to
                    Stroessner's son, so the idea that he was making some real change was
                    far-fetched. Because of his tawdry past and possible connection with narco
                    traffic, we thought it would be better if he departed the Presidency. First of
                    all, Rodriguez, of course, wanted to stay on. He tried to delay the election and
                    we organized a sort of campaign which brought in the church and business people
                    who pressed for holding elections on time. We were successful in generating that
                    kind of popular mood, then a constitutional amendment passed, not by our
                    instigation, but preventing him from running again for reelection. He
                    contemplated a coup but didn't do it. Things looked like they were going
                    swimmingly, so the ruling party had a primary election at the end of 1992.
                    Rodriguez, after recovering from this terrible disappointment, said, “I'll hand
                    pick a successor, I'll arrange the military hierarchy in such a way that I'll
                    continue to have control even when I'm not president, and we'll hand pick a
                    successor.” He chose one of the wealthiest men in the country who had benefitted
                    from the corruption. They held the election, the primary election. Even though
                    they wanted it to be fixed, that didn't quite work and the wrong man won. This
                    was a terrible thing, and they stopped counting; one of the key players in the
                    military told me that they're going to fix the count. They couldn't do it, they
                    had to stop things, just terrible and this was New Year's Eve at the end of 1992
                    and the beginning of 1993. I received someone in the office who said, “The
                    military is going to do a coup, they're going to put in the right person who
                    should have won.” So I inquired around, and confirmed the coup report with four
                    or five people. We contacted the Department and were instructed to approach
                    President Rodriguez and the leading figure in the military General Oviedo and
                    tell them that this should not happen and if it happens we're going to cut off
                    all United States support. We did that, and the Paraguayan military seemed
                    intimidated. In fact, General Oviedo, when we called on him, said, “The only
                    thing I presume is that the United States must be landing troops at the
                    airport.” Finally, the coup didn't occur; however, a statement was made in which
                    the Paraguayan press suggested that the United States was behind the coup. So I
                    issued a public statement that the United States not only did not support a coup
                    but condemned one. The State Department got very upset at this because they said
                    I'd been authorized to make a behind-the-scene approach but not authorized to
                    come out publicly. So I was censured on that, told to stop appearing so much in
                    public. This was still under the Bush presidency.</p>
                <p>In the meantime within the ruling party, instead of having a coup, payments were
                    made by the military and the “right man” won the primary nomination. As these
                    events happened, Clinton was inaugurated. They had to move some of the
                    Ambassadors but I was mentioned as one of the people that would stay on.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>In Paraguay, the ex-President was sent down to observe the general election.
                    There were some attempts at intimidation but the ruling party sent out some of
                    the Generals who told the people that they would lose their civil service
                    positions if the opposition won. They were able to mobilize what appeared to be
                    a credible majority. The new president-elect was a wealthy man named Juan Carlos
                    Wasmosy. We had a dinner with him to talk about the narcotic trafficking
                    problem. He said, even though Rodriguez had played a clear role in his victory,
                    he was prepared to cooperate with the United States and crack down on the
                    narcotic trafficking. No one would be out of reach. We of course welcomed that.
                    He also mentioned to me that he was going to change the military so that
                    Rodriguez' hold on the military would be removed. He was inaugurated. The
                    Administration sent down Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala.
                    They had a nice meeting. Everything looked like it was moving along. President
                    Wasmosy told us that, not only would he crack down but he'd allow the United
                    States to choose the new drug czar. We gave him three names, and he chose an
                    honest General. Things for the first hundred days looked very good and the new
                    drug czar was starting to investigate a lot of really high level
                    involvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>It looked like a very promising situation, but one day the President called me
                    over to his house. (It's right across the street from our compound.) He told me,
                    “You know something strange, there's an officer out here from the counter
                    narcotics directorate that says they're starting to investigate me and General
                    Oviedo.” I said, “Well, I could possibly understand Oviedo but I'm sure he's
                    probably not investigating you Mr. President.” He said, “You check.” I checked,
                    they were looking at the military and Oviedo but not particularly the President.
                    The President said, “Fine, we continue.” Then a few weeks later he called me
                    again, he said, “You know this drug czar we put in there is talking to my
                    opponents within the ruling party.” So I checked it out through the DEA,” and
                    told him, “No it's not true.” I said, “Mr. President why don't we have a meeting
                    in the Palace, we'll have your military advisor, you, let's bring in the drug
                    czar, you can ask him anything you want.” He did and he said, “Are you meeting
                    people in the oppositions?” He said “Absolutely not, Mr. President, I'm a
                    hundred percent behind you.” So the President said, in my presence, “I can tell
                    you that no one here is immune. You investigate, you have total freedom of
                    action.” He said, “That's fine.” So three weeks passed and the President called
                    me up, he said, “You know, I'd like you and Francesca, your wife, to join me and
                    the Ambassador of Brazil and the Papal Nuncio on a special family occasion.
                    We're going to fly to the southern part of Paraguay where we're going to a
                    monastery where my son is buried. He died at 17 prematurely; we'd like you to
                    participate with me in a Mass. It was really an intimate family occasion. We
                    flew down there and it was a terribly moving thing, the President's wife
                    produced these letters from their son and there was crying. We visited his
                    grave, then we went to this little airport to board the President's plane and
                    somebody ran over to me and showed me a piece of newspaper. The article said the
                    Deputy head of the counter drug forces had been removed. I said, “Mr. President,
                    please explain.” He said, “Not to worry. I'll explain to you when we get back to
                    Asuncion.” We went back and the following day they removed not only the deputy
                    but also the head drug czar. We held a country team meeting and said, “What
                    should we do? This shouldn't take place with the United States remaining
                    silent.” The press came up to me at an event during the day and I said, “It's a
                    pity if honest people are being removed.” So, of course, they went to the
                    President. They had this mammoth headline “The American Ambassador doesn't rule,
                    we rule.” A very nationalist reaction of course. I was called into the foreign
                    ministry. The State Department asked, “What are you doing?” I said, “You have to
                    make this public.”</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>President Wasmosy next said to me, “Not to worry, we're going to name an honest
                    man.” For example, he said, “I have this other man named Rodriguez, another
                    civilian, perhaps he could be named drug czar.” I said, “Mr. President, this man
                    was a campaign advisor to one of the leading traffickers in the country, the
                    Governor of the Eastern Province.” Wasmosy said, “Not to worry, we'll get
                    someone else.” So he came to me about a week later and said, “How about my
                    private secretary?” I said, I'd be happy to look into it. He said, “Please do.”
                    We looked into it and it turned out that this man not only had been involved in
                    illegal money transactions but he had represented an airline which belonged to
                    one of the members of the Cali cartel. I said, “Mr. President you can't name
                    persons associated with a cartel as a drug czar.” “Not to worry, we'll do it
                    again.” About a week later, he produced the name of a retired General who we
                    knew was close to the head of the armed forces. But we had nothing against him
                    in the drug area. The State Department, in the meantime, was calling up and
                    saying, “You're interfering in this young democracy.” Wasmosy's nominee Ramon
                    Rosa Rodriguez was made drug czar but it turned out he was killed about nine
                    months later. In any event, that's how we got a new drug czar and, of course,
                    progress on drugs really stopped. When all this happened we of course sent in a
                    yearly drug report on status, and we mentioned this.</p>
                <p>There was some progress earlier in the year but it turned sour at year-end when
                    the honest drug czar was removed. This is all happening, we sent this in and in
                    February 1993, I was called up to Washington to be interviewed for the position
                    of Vice President of the National Defense University. The Assistant Secretary at
                    the time, Alexander Watson, called me in. Also in the room was Michael Skol, the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary. Watson said, “I have to tell you we received
                    complaints from the Paraguayan government about your conduct, your constant
                    confrontation with the President. On this drug czar thing, you had another
                    confrontation. You're in constant confrontation there. We considered this and we
                    decided we should curtail your term. You should be there until July, instead we
                    want you out of there by April 1.” I said, “Who authorized this?” They said, “We
                    told 'them' you're going to be out of there.” I said, “You know it's going to be
                    sort of hard to pack, may take a few extra months.” Watson said, “Just you and
                    your family should be out of there by April 1.” I was upset. I must admit I
                    thought I'd done a great job and here I was being sacked in fact, on the basis
                    of complaints from the Paraguayan government. I said, “Have you looked into this
                    carefully? Do you know what this General Oviedo is about? Do you know anything
                    about the drugs, that we tried to get rid of Rodriguez because of the drug
                    issue?” Skol and Watson said, “No, drugs is not a problem. Paraguay has no
                    trafficking.” I proceeded back to Paraguay to pack my bags. This was in mid
                    February, I was leaving in a month and a half. On April 1st, the annual
                    Presidential certification thing comes out and Paraguay is certified and not
                    only that, the report that comes out is our report that we sent in minus all the
                    negatives. They removed all the negatives. So I sent a cable to Strobe Talbot
                    who I knew a little bit. I said, “Mr. Deputy Secretary, this is based on our
                    report, except you eliminated all the negatives and I think that on a
                    Presidential certification that's not the thing to do.” Then comes back a cable,
                    “We took this into account.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever determine the exact approximate reasons that
                        thPresident sacked all those people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: No, why he sacked the drug people?</p>

                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Oh yes, they were getting too close to General Oviedo, the man who by
                    the way continues to be a very important man in Paraguay. He later, after my
                    departure, attempted to precipitate a coup in Paraguay and the President took
                    refuge in the American Ambassador's house. Finally President Clinton and the OAS
                    Secretary General intervened and helped block the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Grim tale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Yes, the bad part of the tale was thaWashington at least at that early
                    stage was ready to go along with emissaries from people who are obviously
                    corrupt and also tied with narco trafficking. In the Department, I tried to find
                    out who authorized my dismissal and I've never been told. I went to the Director
                    General of the Foreign Service and gave a memo describing the scene which I told
                    you about and she said, “We don't know who authorized this. You should
                    asAlexander Watson.” I doubt they did know although somebody mentioned somebody
                    in the White House might have put out a word that this had gone on long
                    enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bureaucratically, presumably, the predecessor of Gelbard
                        aninternational narcotics was not a player in all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: No, later Gelbard told me that year they'd certified Paraguay, the
                    following years they would not certify Paraguay. To his credit, my successor,
                    Bob Service, in the next two years, reported accurately on their absence of
                    cooperation and they were given a waiver but they were not certified. What
                    alarmed me was the fact that an Embassy report, the only source of information,
                    was selectively edited to convey an erroneous impression for Presidential
                    certification which is not a good thing.</p>
                <p>Q: So you landed back in Washington in 1994 and did you go immediately to the
                    Industrial College of the Armed Forces?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: I spent my first three months after being sent back here in the
                    Historian's Office in the bowels of Columbia Plaza. I had the good fortune of
                    reviewing some of the material on the Cuban Missile Crisis to declassify. There
                    was an interlude and then I was sent over to the Industrial College of the Armed
                    Forces. An article appeared in The Washington Post saying that I'd been sent to
                    Siberia for whatever controversy had been aroused in Paraguay. I started off
                    there and I taught political science for about two years and I received a call
                    one day from a fellow colleague, Ambassador Darryl Johnson, who was involved as
                    a deputy for international coordination on the Bosnia Train and Equip
                    program.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Dayton Accords, the Administration in order to please the
                    Republican members of Congress who objected to our arms embargo against the
                    Bosnian Muslim had agreed lead an international effort to arm the Bosnian
                    federation. Darryl asked if I would be willing to replace him. I said I would do
                    so. I went over there in April 1996. Upon my arrival we found that the Congress
                    had agreed to provide a $100,000,000 dollars of United States drawdown military
                    equipment for the armed forces but no real achievements had been realized yet in
                    terms of gathering international funds. They had a donors conference in Ankara
                    which Strobe Talbot, the Deputy Secretary, attended but there were no pledges.
                    Second of all they had no bank account for any pledges they received, so first I
                    contacted the Treasury Department. They worked out a mechanism whereby foreign
                    government donors would be able to put money in the United States Treasury
                    similar to the Foreign Military Sales account the Saudis and others have. Our
                    innovation was that the donor governments would be allowed to maintain title to
                    their funds. We would never take title to funds, meaning that wouldn't require
                    congressional legislation since we never would own the funds and nor would the
                    Bosnians. At this point, we sent out some presidential letters and Mack McCarty,
                    one of the White House advisors, went out one weekend to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
                    and the United Arab Emirates and got some pledges. Our pledges finally totaled
                    $147,000,000 dollars. Then we, of course, engaged in intensive follow-up effort
                    to secure the deposits in cash in the United States Treasury. We designed a
                    system whereby we would exchange notes with the donor country establishing these
                    accounts and we established a system whereby the Bosnians would request a
                    purchase. They would sign a contract or purchase services such as training and
                    we would then convey these to individual donors and they would decide whether or
                    not they wished to use their money for this purpose. This turned out to work
                    very well indeed. We secured a full 100 percent funding of pledges and never had
                    any serious refusal in terms of cooperation. We then had to figure out a way in
                    which we could buy military equipment which had to be inexpensive. The Bosnians'
                    advisors had told them to buy NATO equipment but this was much too expensive for
                    the amount of funds gathered. We were concerned the Eastern Europeans,
                    particularly those of Orthodox religion, would back the Serbs and not agree to
                    sell arms to Bosnia. We had resistance to overcome. But, through various trips,
                    we were able to get the Ukranian government to agree, the Romanian government to
                    agree, Slovak government, Turkey, Egypt to agree to supply things. Then we
                    helped the Bosnians negotiate contracts, and submitted them to the donor states
                    who agreed to fund them. We have an ongoing policy now in which all but 30
                    million dollars have been disbursed and the Bosnians are much more capable than
                    they were before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does the program continue and do you have a
                        successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: Right, I was replaced by a man named Steve Geis. The head of the
                    program is a fellow named Jim Purdew, a civil servant. They are going to see
                    whether they are going to raise some more funds, which is critical. The
                    interesting thing politically is this program, which the CIA believes is a bad
                    program, because it has created a threat to stability rather than a
                    reinforcement of stability, while the Pentagon also dislikes it because they
                    want to be even-handed. All this is a one sided program and Western Europeans,
                    who are leaning very much toward the Serb side, also oppose it. We can sustain
                    the program simply due to the fact that there is an emotional attachment to the
                    Bosnians, victims of aggression, and because the White House promised the
                    Republicans that they would do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the attitude of the Croatians considering that
                        it'technically a Federation armed force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLASSMAN: The Federation, of course, is made up of the Bosnian Muslims and
                    Bosnian Croats. They've been willing to go along because they also fear a Serb
                    renewal of aggression. Bosnia is landlocked, so we have to bring in our heavy
                    equipment through the Croatian port of Ploce. The Islamic states did not really
                    want to help the Croatians because they knew that the Croatians at one point
                    attacked the Muslims. They feel no loyalty towards them. What we'd do is tell
                    the donors that the federation concept is necessary. We need access to those
                    Croatian ports. In the period before the United States entered the game, Iran
                    was the backer of Bosnia. They never were able to bring in one tank, but we
                    brought in dozens of tanks, lots of ammunition. It's essential to have Croatia
                    on-side to allow that kind of equipment to be brought in. In the event of war,
                    of course, you don't want a two front war with the Serbs attacking on one side,
                    Croats on the other, so its important to keep them on board. So we designed an
                    armed forces structure within Bosnia so that the Bosnia Croat units get a
                    substantial portion, about one third of the assistance.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm struck by how much of your career involved the Cold War either directly in
                    relationships with the Soviet Union or more indirectly in other parts of the
                    world and I'm also struck by the extent of your contact with and working with
                    some of the great men of the period. Do you have any valedictory comments about
                    these common threads or other aspects of your career as a whole?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>GLASSMAN: The Cold War was a great organizer and inspirer in a sense that we knew
                    where the enemy was. We saw attempts to reduce tension such as Kissinger's
                    detente early in the 1970s and we saw the limits of that as the Soviets began to
                    press their imperial efforts. It was a great opportunity to participate in these
                    historical events. As you see, in the post-Cold War world, things like Bosnia
                    become inherently more controversial because U.S. equities are confused and also
                    our instruments for influencing become more limited. Before, we could count on
                    congressional appropriations for the armed forces or the Agency to fund their
                    efforts. Now international donations are increasingly necessary. These are
                    inherently both limited in quantity and also require a different kind of
                    justification. I don't think we've adequately coped with or understood what that
                    involves. In terms of the decision making structure and people participating in
                    it, the thing that obviously rings out is that we have had a conflict with our
                    apparatus as we did with the players on the outside. Maybe because America's a
                    rich country, we can afford duplicating bureaucracies and functions and
                    competing players. That might be a good thing and perhaps, in a sense of free
                    market of ideas, good comes out of it but my reflection is that I've seen a lot
                    more time wasted on internecine warfare than what was necessary or functional. I
                    think it's clear that some redesign of the way we do policy to some more orderly
                    system would be in order. All the Foreign Service Officers and people from other
                    agencies with whom I worked obviously dedicated their lives to our country's
                    service. You wonder, however, if the result of their efforts were perhaps as
                    great as they might have been if there were another way of doing business.
                    That's my brief commentary.</p>
