                <p>Interviewed By: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial Interview Date: March 18, 1987</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to start by asking you one Question. I notice
                        that you were married in Berkeley. Were you in Berkeley as a graduate
                        student when you met your husband ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, I had come over on sabbatical leave from the University of Melbourne,
                    and Carl had come from Harvard. We were both doing doctorates and that was when
                    we met, in International House in Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I suppose it was [19]45.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Berkeley in 1949.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: It must have been 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing we realize we did not put on this interview
                        information form is that we did not ask for your profession...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: My profession was geographer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever practice as a geographer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, I taught at the University of Melbourne from 1939 to '45, and then I
                    taught in the University of California from 1946 to 1948, when I became a
                    research fellow there. And subsequently I taught for the University of
                    California Extension Service. And a little bit when we were overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find this very interesting, because you had your own
                        career, and you met your husband at Berkeley, and he was in the Foreign
                        Service then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No, no, he joined the Foreign Service. I got my Ph.D. before he got his
                    and he joined the Foreign Service after he received his Ph.D. It really wasn't
                    possible to practice my profession as a Foreign Service wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know he was going into the Foreign Service when
                        you married him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You thought you were headed for an academic career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, possibly. I didn't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a few years later you found yourself in Seoul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the 1950s. Now that was the story Stu Kennedy thought
                        would be the most turbulent [of your career] ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: My experience and that of the other ladies did have some applications for
                    any other evacuations. And I think some steps have been taken to avoid some of
                    the difficulties which arose at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no guidelines for evacuation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: None whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was this when the Chinese moved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No, it was the North Koreans who attacked first.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was complicated, because first it was the North Koreans
                        and then as we advanced north the Chinese got nervous and attacked so the
                        original evacuation was when the North Koreans...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: The beginning of the war. It was a Sunday. Comparable to Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the before and after, It was a Sunday, and
                        you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, there had been of course incidents, border incidents before and who
                    knows what provoked the attack. But not long before Secretary of State Acheson
                    had specifically said that South Korea was not in the American defense zone. And
                    whether this influenced the North Koreans to make their attack or not, who
                    knows. It did have a consequence in that when we were evacuated we thought that
                    ...we did not expect American troops to be coming to the aid of the South
                    Koreans. So it was a very sad farewell but as you know President Truman did in
                    fact order American assistance. There was a delay of only about 48 or 72 hours
                    before US troops from Japan were over in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So instead of being an internal affair it was suddenly an
                        international affair, that quickly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I don't know what prompted Truman to make this decision, personally, we
                    were very glad to see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the evacuation take place and where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, I would like to say first that in the morning of Sunday my husband
                    and I were downtown, and when we were going home we saw some Koreans angrily
                    shouting at the railroad station and they had long sticks over their shoulder.
                    The whole scene indicated to us that something had happened. We went home and
                    turned on the Armed Forces Radio which did say that there had been an attack
                    across the border that morning.</p>
                <p>There were no instructions given at that time but we lived in a military compound
                    and the KMAG, the Military Advisory Group, the Korean Military Advisory Group
                    men got word back to their wives that this was bad. And I would say by 11
                    o'clock or some such thing in the morning, ormaybe noon, they had been ... the
                    military wives had begun to pack. Of course there had been no word from the
                    Embassy whatsoever.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I can't recall any advice of any kind coming from the Embassy. I could be wrong
                    about that but I can't recall it. We.. none of us started to pack but we started
                    to dig air raid trenches. During the afternoon it so happened that we had some
                    guests, as we were seeing them to the gate, MIGs, no they couldn't have been
                    MIGs... whatever they were came flying over at tree-top level and really sprayed
                    the compound with bullets. Nobody as it happened got killed, but that I feel was
                    accidental. It could have easily happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you dive for cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well we ran inside, of course, and it gave added incentive to the air raid
                    shelter digging. And I had also started to think about what I might take.
                    Somewhere in the latter part of the day the Armed Forces Radio announced that
                    this was “Sunset for Dependents. Repeat, Sunset for Dependents” We had no idea
                    what it meant, or whether it meant to stay inside, to go to the Embassy, or what
                    it meant. We had not been advised of any code words, had no idea what it meant.
                    So I think we did essentially what the military people around us were doing. We
                    blacked out [windows] and packed some things we thought were necessary for an
                    emergency.</p>
                <p>Quite suddenly during the night our door was knocked on and Military Police were
                    there saying the buses were there to evacuate dependents. So I took what I had
                    packed which was a small suitcase and blankets with the other women and children
                    on the bus, which drove without lights, of course, in the dark to a collecting
                    point which was an airport, a military airport, halfway between Seoul and
                    Inchon, which was the port. Buses came bringing the women and children, school
                    buses, military buses, whatever. The following day we waited there and as I
                    recall there was no food of any kind. It was all right for the adults, but the
                    children, many of them had had nothing since lunch the preceding day.</p>
                <p>The absence of advice to bring food or anything like that, the children were
                    very, very hungry and crying; there were women with small babies who had just
                    snatched whatever bottles they happened to have in the refrigerator. During the
                    afternoon we were gradually evacuated, using these same buses, to a ship that
                    had been delivering fertilizer for ECA, it was called in those days. AID now,
                    fertilizer to South Korea. The unloading of the ship had not been completed, but
                    the Ambassador had commandeered it to evacuate people to Japan or where ever. We
                    were poled out in barges, just a slow poling, by a Korean at the back of the
                    barge, out to this ship which was anchored in the port.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>And [we were] frequently strafed. In fact, our having to lie down in the bottom
                    of the barge, and I consider it somewhat miraculous that again, of course the
                    target was very small and the planes were, you know, just above us but not
                    skilled anyway at shooting a moving target at that point. I'm sure they became
                    so very quickly, but not then. It was a scramble to get up the side of this
                    empty freighter, on board. After we got on board people kind of commandeered
                    space, that they could sit or rest on or something like that. There was no
                    control of the situation at all. And one senior wife commandeered the only cabin
                    on the ship and gathered unto her self the whole little flock, and her
                    contribution, she had brought on - seniority did affect the amount of stuff
                    people were able to put on the ship - and she also brought on some liquor and
                    that was that. They holed up in that cabin and that was all as far as I know
                    anybody saw of that lot for the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the Ambassador? Did he stay [in Seoul]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: He was a bachelor, he stayed. The men had not gotten out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was just women and children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Just women and children. Since you have asked this question. This was a
                    mistake. A few men came, subsequently I was asked by the military in Okinawa for
                    recommendations on the handling of evacuations and one of the things I
                    definitely recommend is that men be sent along, because women are occupied with
                    looking after the children and other things, and there are a lot of things in
                    the course of an evacuation like that for which you need, probably men, or at
                    least single people who are free.</p>
                <p>There was nothing to stop the children from walking off the deck of the
                    freighter, for example, I mean looking after ...the twelve year old boys were an
                    unbelievable nuisance for the whole journey, trying to get across to Japan. Also
                    many women had had servants and were unaccustomed to managing their own
                    children. But it's more than that. You need men assigned with specific
                    responsibilities in the course of an evacuation. Well, we got on board this ship
                    and the crew had done what they could. They knew that people were famished and
                    they had boiled eggs and bread and lard. And people were to line up on the deck
                    to get some of this. And I happened to be standing there, young and no children,
                    standing behind me was a UNICEF nurse, and she said to me, as we were standing
                    in this line to get our eggs and lard, she said, “This is going to be a disaster
                    unless we get organized. It's already showing symptoms of being a disaster.”</p>
                <p>So, I will tell you that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to ask you, a disaster in what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BARTZ: A lack of organization. There were some women who exercised their heads.
                    The wife of one of the KMAG people happened to be a nurse, and she broke into, I
                    think broke in, maybe had a key, I don't know, but broke into the Embassy
                    dispensary with an open suitcase and just swept the drugs into her suitcase and
                    this was all she brought on board. But a vital, vital thing. There would have
                    been no medications if she hadn't of her own thoughtfulness done that. While we
                    were, I guess after we had had the eggs and lard, I don't remember, a crane
                    finally with a net and unloaded food which I presume had come from the
                    commissary onto the deck of the freighter.</p>
                <p>There was a mad and uncontrolled and vicious scramble to secure food. People were
                    doing it, and perhaps not for themselves, but for these screaming kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we are talking about Embassy wives, AID, mission
                        wives, USIA, military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Right. And a very brave military person seeing this pandemonium, a woman,
                    seeing this pandemonium, stood up with great personal courage and told them off.
                    And succeeded in stopping this riot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was not the DCM's wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No, no person from the Embassy. The situation threw up its own leader. Her
                    courage was very great indeed in dealing with that howling mob. And the food was
                    then gathered to be used collectively, not before some odd cans and things had
                    disappeared. But she really did stand them off and establish order. And from
                    then on this military person, who had no official capacity, was in charge of
                    food and supplies.</p>
                <p>And it happened that way. I don't know what it would have been like if this woman
                    had not, of her own personal strength...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her natural leadership abilities just took over in time of
                        crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BARTZ: That's right. In the meantime the nurse said, “We must do something for
                    the babies.” And so she talked to the, I don't know whether it was the Captain,
                    or the ship's mate or something, and we were given a little pantry where items
                    had been cooked to serve the people on the bridge. It wasn't really a kitchen.
                    It was like a pantry where they could heat coffee and that kind of thing. And
                    the nurse established, from the military person she got all the food for the
                    children under two segregated and brought into this pantry. And she had this
                    military person announce over the loudspeaker that all women with children under
                    two were to bring the bottles for their babies to this pantry.</p>
                <p>The reason for doing that was that some people had come with just one bottle and
                    some had come with two or three, and you know it was to collect it so that the
                    feeding could be organized and the bottles sterilized in between to feed the
                    babies on schedule. So she wrote down all the names on the back of the door, the
                    formula for the baby, number of feedings per day, and I was just her helper and
                    all I did for all that time, I don't know, thirty-six hours or so, was fill the
                    baby bottles, make batches of formula and label and sterilize bottles and we
                    kept the door locked and, I don't know about locked, but they had to knock to
                    get a bottle for their baby. There was a refrigerator, if you can imagine the
                    tiny refrigerator we had stacked with baby bottles. And little toddlers when
                    they came up we had paper bowls or something like that, and we sat them in the
                    corridor and made sure that the tiny ones got fed.</p>
                <p>Organizing meals on the outside for the adults was one meal, I think, a day, and
                    it took a great deal of effort to kind of get that organized because on this
                    little ship we had over 600 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 600! That's a lot of people to feed and keep under
                        control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: There were 632 or something of that order. I'm sure there is a record of
                    it, but it was a very large number of people on a very small ship. In the hold
                    where the fertilizer had been, it had been unloaded, you know, stack by stack.
                    As we got out to sea and the weather got rough, this wall of fertilizer bags
                    threatened to topple and the women had to scramble and take the top bags off,
                    and eventually they had them all on the floor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words they had to go down and rearrange the
                        cargo.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BARTZ: It had to be done by hand, and I am sure that such men as had come along
                    helped with that, but it...humping fertilizer bags, and I'm sure that in any
                    evacuation there is going to be something like that, where you need a work
                    brigade. Not merely the elderly men, but a work brigade to stack food or
                    whatever. And of course the toilet situation was very, very difficult indeed.
                    Maintaining order in that was another problem, and I was so busy in the pantry
                    with the babies that I don't really know how this military No. 1 woman, who was
                    not of any rank, it was nothing to do with that, I'm sure she had a latrine
                    detail, she had a food detail, she had, you know...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did people sleep?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: In the holds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With blankets or sleeping bags?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Oh no, they didn't bring any blankets or sleeping bags. Oh no, if they had
                    a coat. That was another thing, it was a sunny day when we were evacuated and
                    many people were just in summer dresses. And as we got to sea it got very cold
                    and rained. There was really no instruction as to what to bring along. And
                    children didn't have their names on them or, people didn't bring anything to
                    drink, any food; drinking supplies were a problem. I think ... I hope, that
                    posts now have, the military I know have devised such a list, that this is SOP
                    what you have ready, or what you bring in time of evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you at sea with these 600+ women and
                        children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I might be corrected, but I think it was something like the morning of the
                    fourth day when we pulled into, or the third day, when we pulled up off a harbor
                    in the southern part of Japan.On board that ship were four women who were in
                    labor. We got to Japan without either a birth or a death, and it was a miracle
                    that we got there without a death. We had elderly people, we had an epileptic
                    who threw a fit, we had unsupervised children who had accidents, a broken
                    finger, this and that, and as it happened I believe we had one child who was
                    sickening with polio. But, because there had been a polio epidemic. This nurse I
                    mentioned, who I think got working with one or two other women who had had
                    nursing experience just didn't stop the entire trip because ... and the
                    medication she had brought were a savior for that trip. I remember her wearily
                    walking down the gangplank carrying this terribly sick little child in her arms
                    when we finally got to Japan. And I did hear subsequently that the child had
                    polio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who met you in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BARTZ: The Red Cross had organized...it was the greatest sight to see these
                    soldiers who had coffee and doughnuts as the Red Cross always does, but they
                    also had Kotex and bandages and other things that were necessary. I was so weary
                    at that point from being on my feet that I remember our joy in seeing them and
                    their helpfulness.</p>
                <p>We were taken in buses to a military camp where the poor youngsters who had
                    joined the peace time army and had not really thought they were due for war duty
                    were packing up, we were in their barracks, so we helped them get ready to go
                    off to war. Got the names and addresses of their mothers and parents and said we
                    would write. And some of them were trying to get the wash done and various other
                    things. And there were young boys who had been in the occupation forces in a
                    sort of idyllic situation in southern Japan and we saw them off, back to the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now where was your husband? Did you have any word from
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: The men..Oh no, what happened was that the Embassy operated more or less I
                    think as normal on Monday because Seoul, which had been strafed the day before,
                    still had not been occupied. I think it was a pretty mad scramble. They got out
                    by air but the planes were shotat. The other books have told their story and
                    that some things, documents, were destroyed but some that should have been
                    destroyed were not destroyed. Seems that nobody thought to destroy the personnel
                    records of the Koreans who had worked for the Embassy, and other things that
                    might have been brought out were not.</p>
                <p>I subsequently worked in GHQ in Tokyo and nobody had thought to bring out the
                    maps. In General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo we were handicapped by the
                    fact that up to date information and maps had not been brought out. They were
                    destroyed instead of being brought out. I hope they were destroyed, that I don't
                    know. The lack handicapped the war effort. I'm not saying anything I shouldn't
                    say. I'm sure that anyone who worked in intelligence would tell you that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We left behind a blue print for the North Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, it may have been destroyed. I'm not saying it was left behind. We
                    didn't bring it out. And it was a grave handicap. Perhaps they didn't bring it
                    out because it had been declared beyond the defense perimeter. But it should
                    have been on file somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did your husband catch up with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BARTZ: He flew out and landed at an adjoining ...was taken to an adjoining
                    military depot and in the end the women were taken to the depot where the men
                    were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about that. Here we have
                        gotten them out and we have gotten them into a military camp and, then they
                        did join their husbands at another camp?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, another encampment. I wouldn't know how many days it took. People
                    were of course frantic trying to find out if their husbands had been
                    successfully evacuated.</p>
                <p>And this was a tremendous worry for them during the evacuation and for some
                    little time afterwards, I think the military somehow or other posted information
                    as to where the men were, the names, and even on a field telephone enabled the
                    women to talk between the camps so that ... the Japan end of it was handled very
                    well, considering what it was, that we were able to find out relatively quickly
                    where the men were. And that they were safely out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have often wondered, we were never evacuated in our
                        thirty years...I have often wondered how long did you have to pack? How many
                        hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: None</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: None, you just had to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: There was no information whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you decide what to take and what did you take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, I took my husband's doctoral dissertation and a few valuable items.
                    And one thing I did do was put on several layers of clothing which proved
                    useful. And dressed for an evacuation, you know, flat shoes and that kind of
                    thing, that was extremely important because under any circumstances you are
                    going to be on your feet for a long period of time and it is essential to be
                    comfortably dressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now after the tide turned in the war and the U.S. troops
                        helped push the North Koreans back again, what is it, to the Yalu River, did
                        you go back to Seoul?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BARTZ: No, what happened was that we were in this camp in the southern part of
                    Japan and I telephoned up to G-2 in Tokyo, asking them if they could use a
                    cartographer, or geographer, and they sent down top priority orders for me to
                    come up to Tokyo and work there and Carl, who had no assignment because of the
                    evacuation came with me, and we...it was a desperate situation because G-2 in
                    Tokyo was not equipped to be handling the demands of war. Carl went back [to
                    Seoul], you know they [the North Koreans] pushed all the way down the peninsula.
                    He went over to Pusan and I worked in G-2 in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>I was pregnant, and I worked until as long as I could until the baby was born
                    because it didn't matter that I was heavily pregnant, they really needed help.
                    At one stage I had 23 men working on logarithmic curves, doing maps for them to
                    fly back to Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I am absolutely intrigued with this. Because I think
                        before we started taping you said, “Well, I never got to practice my
                        profession.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Oh, well, this was just in an emergency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, but you were invaluable to them at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, there was just a shortage. But Carl's situation in Pusan in the
                    middle of the war was just very difficult, he got pneumonia twice that winter.
                    It was an unbelievable scenario.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position in the mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, there were only two Embassy people over there and I don't know
                    exactly what, I suppose they called him Information Officer, or something, in
                    the Consulate in Pusan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with USIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, he was with USIS always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was in Pusan, and you were pregnant...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BARTZ: He got leave for the birth of the baby. He had Korean language and he
                    would have been in Korea anyway, it was either the Navy or the Embassy, and he
                    decided he wanted to be with the Embassy, so he was up and down with the war. As
                    the front lines advanced he was in Seoul and when they got pushed back, they
                    were further south and I think he was evacuated from Seoul three times.</p>
                <p>He went back to our house where we had buried a few items just before we left,
                    and it was just a hole in the ground. It had been shelled, and he couldn't...the
                    house didn't exist any more, it was gone. And it was very worrying for me, you
                    mentioned, the Chinese coming in. We were sitting in G-2 in Tokyo watching this
                    massive buildup north of the Yalu and wondering what was going to happen at the
                    time, and meanwhile I was getting letters from him saying that the situation is
                    stabilizing, etc., etc., and it was infuriating not to be able to tell him over

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: And we didn't really know, one assumes that when a buildup like that is
                    taking place that it's not for no reason, but ... the higher ups, the military,
                    they were aware of it, I don't know what their judgement was as to whether the
                    Chinese were going to come in or not. It was getting very, very cold when they
                    did come. It was at least November, maybe December, the dead of winter. Maybe
                    they didn't expect them, but as far as the buildup was concerned, that was
                    clearly marked on the maps.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No...Yes, we were, but that was later. MacArthur....when we went back
                    after Korea, Carl was assigned to Tokyo and we were there at Perry House, which
                    you may have heard of, we were there when Truman recalled MacArthur.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in San Francisco, and I was pregnant at the time,
                        and I was able to, I was working for an advertising agency, and I was able
                        to walk out and watch him in this open phaeton, very grand through the
                        streets of San Francisco, and it was the first time in my life that I ever
                        sort of panicked in a mob. It wasn't really a mob, but it was just everyone
                        rushing to see him, and there I was feeling very fragile and vulnerable, and
                        I remember pushing against a building in a doorway while all these people
                        surged by to get a good look at him. And I had already had my look at him,
                        so I really fled back to my office. I had never experienced that kind of
                        panic before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, it made an impression on the Japanese. They really thought he was a
                    kind of god, and they wondered what the future held.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you what was the reaction in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I don't really know except that the American reaction was stunned, but the
                    Japanese really thought that the whole...were even a little frightened at what
                    might happen because the occupation had been benign. They were very upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we just put on the tape why MacArthur was recalled?
                        Was there one specific incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, I think...I can't speak to that. It had been brewing for a long
                    time, what particularly brought it on I don't know. He had been aggravating the
                    civilian command for quite a long time. What particular order he refused to obey
                    that brought it to a ... I don't know. There is documentation of that, I'm sure,
                    in both Truman's...in the lives of Truman and of MacArthur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you then go meet your husband and come home for
                        leave and go back to Tokyo, or did you stay on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: What had happened was that I had the baby, the baby was born in Tokyo and
                    I went first to Australia and then to stay with his parents in Texas, and then
                    when he got leave from Korea he came to Texas and we came up to DC and he found
                    out that his new assignment was Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So back to the Orient you went, and really spent,
                        goodness, how many years there until '63. You were there 13 years on and off
                        with Seoul and Tokyo and Naha and Rangoon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, we were there a long time before we got our Washington assignment at
                    all. They don't do that nowadays, and I think that's a good idea to bring people
                    back more frequently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I do think you get removed from American living by being out, overseas too
                    continuously. Your children do, and you do. You try to keep up, but..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the child you had in Tokyo, was it a boy or a

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: A girl.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I have two children. Two girls, the other one was born as it happens also
                    in Tokyo. But six years later.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Naha and on to Rangoon, and this was
                        after Okinawa had been returned to Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No it had not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, here it is, 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: It was definitely under the military occupation while we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then of course when you were in Korea. Syngman Rhee
                        was in charge while you were there. He was around for a long time too,
                        wasn't he? From '48 to '60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: He was considered the founder of, the leader of the independence movement
                    against Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at first he really was a hero?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, he had been in Hawaii, and I don't know, I suppose he was a
                    returning hero. His regime was very severe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was really an introduction to the Foreign
                        Service, wasn't it? You never had an experience like that again did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No, not of evacuation, no.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: We were not there at a time of coups or for the war that separated East
                    Pakistan. We were in Burma at the time of a coup, but it was a bloodless coup
                    when Ne Win took over from U Nu.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: They still liked foreign life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where are they now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: One is married and living in North Carolina and the other happens to be
                    home at the moment, but will be, I expect, moving out before very long.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BARTZ: No, not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I really think that is an extraordinary tale. Not to
                        dwell on unpleasantness, but I would just like to go back to the senior
                        woman in the evacuation who commandeered the cabin and gathered her friends
                        around her...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BARTZ: Gathered her, I don't know necessarily friends, but people who were
                    employed, belonged to her section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see, but how terrible for morale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I don't know. She was ... I don't think that in situations like this that
                    one should expect that the leadership to come from the senior wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you said, it's the person who had the natural
                        leadership ability who just took over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Yes, I think that, Embassy is Embassy, but when it is a matter of life and
                    death, it's better to leave that. If it so happens that the Ambassador's wife,
                    or someone who has the calibre OK, it's not necessarily related to the rank of
                    the wife. Within an Embassy, that is another thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you ever seen an Embassy evacuation plan? I'm sure,
                        well, I know they have them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: No, I haven't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be interesting to..well I'm sure that the State
                        Department before it worked out an evacuation plan must have talked to
                        someone who had been through an evacuation. Who had had the experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Possibly someone had a broader view of this event than I did. I was in a
                    room fixing baby bottles. I'm sure now. But I think it is also very essential
                    that, if there are going to be code words, that they should be clearly
                    identified. Maybe it's not even necessary to have a code word because they give
                    the instructions in open English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the military has to have a code word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Well, maybe, but as far as I know the Embassy had no, of course I was a
                    very young person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: Let me see, I am now 66, and we were speaking of 1950, so I was 30 years
                    of age.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get from Australia to Berkeley to get your

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: I came on ... I was not a war bride, but I came on a war bride ship. I
                    came on the old Mariposa, which took a few paying passengers, and we were out in
                    the Pacific at the time that the Bikini bomb was set off, and the old Mariposa
                    really put on a head of steam to get out of the range. And whether we were
                    enough out of the range, I don't know. But we wondered why the ship was going so
                    fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess what I also meant was, how did you happen to

                </p>
                <p>BARTZ: That was a matter of my field of study, in geography. I could have gone
                    anywhere in the world, but the Berkeley department [had an excellent
                    reputation].</p>

                    was published by the Oxford University Press, Oxford England, in 1972. It is
                    used in preparatory courses in Korean geography in universities and colleges,
                    and as a reference book throughout the world. 6,000 copies have been printed.The
                    maps which Mrs. Bartz helped prepare at the U.S. Headquarters in Tokyo were used
                    by pilots who bombed and strafed military targets in South Korea when it was
                    occupied by the North Koreans.</p>
