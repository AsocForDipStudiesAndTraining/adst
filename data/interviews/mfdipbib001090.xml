                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 14, 1997. This interview is with Scott E.
                        Smith who served with AID for a little over 21 years from 1974-96, retiring
                        in May, 1996. Scott, let's start off with a little background of where you
                        grew up, where you went to school and how you became interested in
                        international development.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years, education and work experience</p>
                <p>SMITH: I was born and lived for the first eleven years of my life in Indiana. My
                    first exposure to international development work was when my maternal
                    grandfather, at the age of 60, began to work for a predecessor agency of AID. In
                    1955, he and my grandmother went to Libya as a production credit advisor for the
                    foreign aid program. My grandfather had been a dairy farmer and involved in
                    production credit operations in Indiana and neighboring states through most of
                    his career. I don't recall exactly what it was that led him to the international
                    side of things, but that turned out to be a very significant event in my life.
                    My grandfather spent a little over two years in Libya, and then went to Korea
                    from 1958 to 1960, again as an agricultural credit advisor with the assistance
                    program.</p>
                <p>During the time that my grandparents were in Korea, my father, who was working in
                    the Farm Bureau coop in Indiana and was a specialist in agricultural
                    cooperatives, also joined the predecessor to AID (ICA). His initial assignment
                    was to have been to Khartoum, in the Sudan, but disturbances that were occurring
                    there, even in 1960, changed that assignment. As a result, in June, 1960, our
                    family left Indiana and went to La Paz, Bolivia where my father worked as an
                    agricultural cooperative advisor as part of the “servicio agricola”. So, when I
                    was eleven years old—in fact, I celebrated my eleventh birthday on the way to
                    Bolivia—my family and I left the United States and spent two years living in La
                    Paz. I spent my 6th and 7th grade at the American school in La Paz, Bolivia, and
                    our family did a lot of traveling around that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any conversations with your grandfather about
                        his work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I also have some of his papers that include trip reports and his end
                    of tour reports from his time in Libya. They are fascinating to read. I was
                    reading them not too long ago and it is interesting how some of the issues that
                    he dealt with are the same ones we were dealing with in the '90s in AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember any particular ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think a lot of it had to do with the commitment of the people we were
                    working with and to the extent to which they shared the same vision or ideas
                    about the programs that we were working on. There was much more of a tone in
                    some of his writings from the '50s about American know how going to solve
                    problems in a fairly quick time, which, of course, hasn't proved to be the case,
                    certainly not in Libya.</p>
                <p>It was fascinating to see that some of the same issues involving the interaction
                    between foreign advisors and local counterparts have endured over the 40 year
                    period. I don't have many of my grandfather's writings of his from his time in
                    Korea. They probably would have described a little more successful effort, given
                    the general nature of the Korean experience and the assistance program there.
                    But it was quite interesting to read all of that and to get that perspective on
                    his experiences. Aside from that, I guess we really didn't talk a lot about his
                    experiences in international development, although, I must say, that when I
                    joined AID in 1974, a few years before his death, I don't think he was too
                    thrilled with the fact that I had chosen that as a career. I think he had come
                    to see some of the difficulties of moving families around the world. Certainly
                    there is a positive side to all that, by all means, but I am not sure in the end
                    he was especially happy with the legacy that he started first through my
                    father's and then through my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father went with him to Libya and Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean when he was growing up and your grandfather was
                        serving in these countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. Grandfather started late in life, only a few years before my father
                    joined, but I think he was the stimulus for my father to join. My father then
                    served the rest of his career in AID, from 1960-78. So, my grandfather and he
                    overlapped for a year or so, and then my father and I overlapped for about four
                    years, from the time I joined until he retired. So, in June, 1996 when I
                    retired, it was the first time in 40 years that someone in our family wasn't
                    working directly for the foreign assistance program.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Anyway, we spent a couple of years in Bolivia, 1960-62. We moved back to Indiana
                    for a few months during the last half of 1962, when my mother finished her
                    Masters Degree at Ball State University. Then, in January, 1963, we moved to Rio
                    de Janeiro, Brazil. My father worked there for two and a half years, until the
                    middle of 1965. After home leave during the summer of 1995, we returned to Rio
                    for about a month, then transferred to Recife, in northeastern Brazil, where my
                    father worked another two years. So, all of my high school years were spent in
                    Brazil, first at the American school in Rio and then later at the American
                    school in Recife, which is where I graduated from high school in 1967.</p>
                <p>During the time we lived in Bolivia and Brazil, I had an opportunity to travel a
                    lot in those countries. My family traveled several times with my father in
                    Bolivia, including to some places that are hard to believe—looking back on it
                    now—that we went to, given the general state of roads and accommodations in
                    those years. In Brazil, I went on a few business trips with my dad when I was on
                    school vacations and then, as a family, we traveled around quite a bit in the
                    country. As I got older some friends and I went on some long bus trips to
                    Salvador, Bahia, and Brasilia.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of our time in Brazil came when I was a junior in high
                    school. The American school in Recife organized a two-week trip up the Amazon
                    River for most of the high school. We flew from Recife to Belem, at the mouth of
                    the Amazon, and then took a small nut boat and cruised up the river as far as
                    Manaus, stopping at several different towns along the way. Because it was a
                    school expedition, we made an effort to study the river and its inhabitants and
                    the environment. It was just a fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>So, I was able to travel a lot in Brazil; in fact, by the time I graduated from
                    high school I think I had been in more states in Brazil than I had in the United
                    States. That really made a tremendous impression on me and I think from an early
                    age influenced me to do something in international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize your impressions of the local
                        people? I assume you had a fair amount of contact with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:A lot of our contacts were among the American community in the countries
                    where we lived. I think that remains the case now. It probably was even more so
                    in those days, in a way. Many of the people we went to school with were other
                    AID or embassy people, so a lot of the social contacts were with others in the
                    American community. However, during the last couple of years in Recife, I did
                    have a number of Brazilian friends. I don't know that at that age I took
                    conscious notice of differences or similarities among my Brazilian and American
                    friends. It certainly helped with my fluency in Portuguese.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>If I look back on that time in my life, what I remember most was feeling so well
                    off compared to the mass of people, particularly in Recife—although it was true
                    as well in Rio—and being very uncomfortable with that. In Rio, we were members
                    of a tennis club on a little lake and all around the lake were the favelas—the
                    slums, or shanty towns—on the hills,. It always made me uncomfortable to be
                    sitting there in the club and looking out on what otherwise was a beautiful
                    lake, but having it surrounded by hills covered with shacks of people who were
                    basically squatting on those lands. And likewise in Recife, about three or four
                    blocks from our house was a favela. It faced the main street where we would
                    catch the bus to go downtown. So, it was ever present, difficult to get away
                    from. The memory that was most lasting from that time is the difference, the
                    gap, between the rich and the poor, and really feeling badly about that and
                    wanting to do something about it.</p>
                <p>After graduating from high school, I went to college at Johns Hopkins University,
                    in Baltimore. Hopkins at the time—they may still have—had a five year program in
                    international relations which gave a bachelor's degree after four years and a
                    masters degree after the fifth. I spent three years at the campus in Baltimore
                    and then two years at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) here
                    in Washington, with a summer program in between the third and fourth year. The
                    summer program was in Europe. We had a class in Geneva, then about six weeks to
                    travel around, ostensibly to the country where we could practice the language we
                    were studying, which in my case was Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular courses you found
                        appealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The undergraduate course that I particularly liked was one on U.S. economic
                    history. One of the things I remember from that was looking at the determinants
                    of. development and the debates about what had caused the economic “take off” in
                    the U.S....the railroads, the canal system, etc....and looking at the variety of
                    different factors that influenced the development of our country. Having lived
                    in Latin America for about seven years, at SAIS I took Latin America studies,
                    which gave me an opportunity to study a little bit more of the history and the
                    politics. But most of my courses there also focused on economic development and
                    the determinants of economic growth.</p>
                <p>The masters program at SAIS was focused around three topics from a menu you could
                    choose from. They really didn't have much of a focus on development in the early
                    '70s when I was there, so the three themes that I chose were international
                    economics, comparative politics, which got more to the political and social
                    dimensions of different political systems, and Latin American studies. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write a paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SMITH:I wrote several papers, but none of them were particularly memorable. There
                    was not a requirement at SAIS for a master's thesis or anything like that, so
                    there wasn't a major report or paper that I did at that time.</p>
                <p>Research assistant with Overseas Liaison Committee of the American Council on
                    Education</p>
                <p>While I was still at SAIS I took a part time job as a research associate at the
                    American Council on Education. The American Council on Education had a group
                    called the Overseas Liaison Committee, which was primarily oriented towards
                    trying to develop relationships between US universities and the then-emerging
                    universities in Africa. It's focus was primarily on Africa. In the early '70s,
                    they were interested in expanding their focus from Africa to Asia and Latin
                    America. As an initial step in that direction, they hired a couple of people,
                    and I was one of them, to do some research into what similar organizations were
                    doing in Latin America and Asia. I focused on Latin America. The result of our
                    research, after a year or more, was the publication of a directory of
                    organizations that were involved in development, particularly development aimed
                    at improving education, throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of this organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The purpose was to promote linkages between US universities and their
                    counterparts, initially in Africa, and they were looking for ways to expand that
                    kind of approach to Latin America and Asia. Of course, the situation in the
                    terms of higher education was much different in Latin America and Asia than it
                    was in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a group under a larger organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:This was a group under the American Council on Education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the people you worked for
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, Carl Eicher was the chairman of the Overseas Liaison Committee. He
                    was at Michigan State University, an agricultural economist and someone who had
                    done a lot of work in rural development in Africa, an area in which he has
                    continued to work. In fact, our paths crossed again many years down the road
                    when we were in Zimbabwe. Shirley Fischer was the director of the committee
                    staff. Carl and Shirley later were married, so we met up again, too, in Zimbabwe
                    in the mid '80s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any connection with Carl Bigelow and
                        Fred Haberson and their work on XXX planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. They were among the people who were involved in the early work of the
                    Overseas Liaison Committee, particularly in Africa.</p>
                <p>I ended up staying at the Overseas Liaison Committee for about 2 and a half years
                    all together. After I graduated from Hopkins, they offered me a one year
                    contract, which was then renewed for another two years. I worked on a number of
                    things at the OLC, including the directory which I mentioned. One of the other
                    highlights was the work I did with a graduate student of Carl's at Michigan
                    State, who was from Ethiopia, on an annotated bibliography of rural development
                    in Africa. I traveled a few times to East Lansing to work with this fellow,
                    whose name is Tekola Dejene. Tekola later became the agriculture minister of
                    Ethiopia. I don't know what became of him. He was minister under the Mengistu
                    regime.</p>
                <p>Our work on the bibliography was part of the preparations for a conference
                    sponsored by the Overseas Liaison Committee, I think with AID funding, on rural
                    development in Africa. It was held in Addis Ababa in October, 1973. Several of
                    us from the OLC went to Ethiopia to help organize the conference and provide the
                    logistics for it. It was an interesting conference consisting of three or four
                    days of meetings, discussions and presentation of papers, and four days of field
                    trips to visit sites of rural development programs that were underway in
                    Ethiopia. That was the first time I had been in Africa, and it was such an
                    exception to what I had done before that my wife (we had been married the year
                    before in 1972) joined me at the end of the conference and we spent the next two
                    weeks traveling around Africa thinking that perhaps this would be the only
                    chance in our lives to visit Africa. She came to Ethiopia and we went from there
                    to visit Tanzania, Kenya and Zaire, where a college roommate of mine was working
                    at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this conference was there any particular theme or
                        particular point about the rural development process and what worked and
                        didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, the focus really was on that and there was an interesting combination
                    of practitioners and university professors and researchers. Again, the Overseas
                    Liaison Committee was traditionally a group of academics and professors focusing
                    on university to university relations, and they were trying to move beyond that
                    to get more involved in development work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were universities that worked in rural
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SMITH:Well, what we did was to look at the experiences of a number of projects.
                    The World Bank was financing a program, the Swedish aid agency was also
                    financing a program that we looked at. I think the focus, as I recall, was
                    really on integrating a variety of different perspectives and interventions,
                    because any individual type of intervention was viewed not as likely to succeed
                    unless a variety of constraints and issues that affected local people were also
                    addressed. In addition to the projects in Ethiopia that we visited, there were
                    case studies from throughout Africa, both English and French speaking Africa,
                    that were later compiled into a publication of the conference proceedings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes.</p>
                <p>I worked on a number of other things with the Overseas Liaison Committee. One of
                    them was called the international seminar series which was a series where we
                    invited prominent people, mostly academics, from different parts of the world to
                    visit a number of US colleges and universities that were somewhat off the beaten
                    track for international visitors. It wasn't a program to go to some of the
                    bigger schools that already had international programs and visitors, but for
                    some regional colleges and universities, even community colleges, where, for
                    example, they might have had a Hispanic Studies program, or the beginnings of
                    one. We were able to arrange visits of people from Latin America—from Mexico,
                    Central America, the Caribbean—to those schools to provide a perspective which
                    they didn't often have access to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a particular message developed for these
                        visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't know that there was any particular message. It really was more to
                    allow students in this country who were in those programs, and again it was
                    focused on those schools who had Hispanic or Asian studies programs, to have an
                    opportunity to talk with people from the region itself, and exchange views,
                    perspectives and expand their knowledge, so that Hispanic-American studies
                    programs would be able to tap some of the resources and perspectives of Spanish
                    speaking countries outside the United States.</p>
                <p>Joined USAID as an IDI in 1974</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In 1973, I first applied to AID as part of the international development intern
                    (IDI) program, but I wasn't accepted. In 1974, I applied again and this time I
                    was accepted. The IDI program has gone through a number of cycles, but in those
                    days interns were hired to go to a specific country for a specific assignment. I
                    was selected to go to Laos as a program economist, which I found somewhat
                    curious, but this was an indication of things to come. Since my living
                    experience had been in Latin America, my academic experience and training had
                    also been in Latin America, and to the extent that I had any experience outside
                    of Latin America it was my work with the Overseas Liaison Committee in Africa,
                    where else should I be assigned but to Asia!</p>
                <p>I remember at the time thinking, “at least it's not Vietnam”, and since this was
                    1974 and we were getting to the end of the wars in southeast Asia, I accepted
                    the offer and joined AID in October, 1974.</p>
                <p>Another early experience that should have given me some insight into what I was
                    getting into was that the program was actually supposed to start a couple of
                    weeks earlier than it did, but because the appropriations bill hadn't been
                    passed, there were no funds yet to bring people on, so our starting date was
                    delayed by a couple of weeks until there were funds to enable people to travel
                    and to come in and start with the training program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the training program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The orientation at that point in the IDI program was a five week process.
                    The first two weeks were classroom training in the old Pomponia Plaza building
                    in Rosslyn, which AID no longer occupies. Besides briefings on health and life
                    insurance and filling out the forms, etc., the focus was on project
                    documentation, project design, contracting process, etc., most of which went
                    over our heads because we had no context in which to apply it. But, at least we
                    did get some introduction to the forms and to the acronyms and the language of
                    the organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any discussion about development concepts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Indeed. In fact, the highlight of the training for us, something that has
                    been discontinued, was a two-week off site exercise—which in our case was in
                    Garrett County, Maryland—where as a group we were tasked with developing a
                    project using AID's systems and documents, but doing it in concert with local
                    officials and making it as much as possible a real development project.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>There were about 15 or 20 of us in my group and we went to western Maryland and
                    spent two weeks there meeting with county and other local officials and coming
                    up the design of 3-4 development projects based on those contacts. Then those
                    projects were reviewed by a panel of people from the agency, so that we got some
                    feedback and some perspective of what kinds of things AID officers were looking
                    for in projects. I think that was useful from a number of perspectives.
                    Obviously, it became much less of an academic exercise to actually try and take
                    some of these procedures and documents and to make use of them when we had been
                    working for the agency for less than a month. It was interesting to get some
                    feedback and to get some exposure to other people in the agency. But, it was
                    also very important in forming an esprit de corps, sort of a group solidarity,
                    among the IDI class because we were there all together, although as a group we
                    were working on four different projects and broken up into four groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the four projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I was trying to remember that. I don't recall what the four projects were.
                    One of them, and I don't think it was the one our group worked on, had to do
                    with expanding social services in the community. Another one was more of a
                    bricks and mortar, construction oriented project. One of them may have been to
                    develop a little more the skiing industry in that part of the country. We
                    actually stayed at the Wisp ski lodge— it was off season, in November. The
                    project ideas were ones that reflected the priorities of the local
                    officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the reception by the various officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Very positive. They were anxious to get the benefit of the perspectives of
                    a group of young professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that what you did was beneficial
                        to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes, I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of communication and participation with
                        the local community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:There was quite a bit. Not so much with the community per se, but a lot
                    with the local officials and service providers. It was a two-week process so was
                    a fairly abbreviated one, obviously, because not only did we have to meet with
                    those folks and come up with ideas and design it, but we had to write up a
                    couple versions of the paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the critique like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't recall particulars, but do recall it being constructive, although
                    somewhat superficial, as would be normal for people who have other jobs and are
                    kind of looking at what was a fairly quickly written document about something
                    that was apart from their main line of business. On the other hand, it did give
                    me, as I think about it now, some perspectives that I was able to apply pretty
                    quickly as we were doing the real thing, but with me involved more on the review
                    side of documents that came up.</p>
                <p>Our program basically went through the Thanksgiving holidays and into the
                    beginning of December. Each of us then started our rotation assignments in
                    Washington offices, and it worked then pretty much as it does now. The interns
                    were expected to spend some time in a variety of offices in Washington prior to
                    going to the field to get a perspective on, and maybe to meet some people who
                    were involved in, the programs where we were going to go. So, my main office
                    there was the Laos desk and from there spend some brief rotations in the the
                    program office and a few technical offices of what was then the East Asia
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:My impression was that the more I learned about the Laos program, the less
                    I liked what I saw. My earlier rationalization of, “it's not Vietnam, so okay,”
                    began to break down as I learned more and more about the program in Laos and
                    what we were doing there. Probably about a third of the overall program was what
                    we later called economic support, another third was really related to the areas
                    of infrastructure support where the war was going on, and only a small portion
                    was what I thought were true development programs. And—something that was to
                    became a feature of my AID career— I was not at all happy with the heavy
                    political influences on the assistance we were providing, which really drove the
                    program in Laos.</p>
                <p>First assignment with the Development Finance Office, Latin America Bureau -
                    1975</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So, I did something which gave a tremendous boost to my career in a variety of
                    different ways. I asked to have my assignment changed to Latin America. Through
                    one of my IDI colleagues, who was working in the Latin America Bureau, I learned
                    that at that time, in early 1975, there was a tremendous volume of project
                    reviews going on. AID was just changing to a unified documentation system.
                    Previous to that time, the loan programs had followed a certain format and
                    content and grant programs used separate documentation. As a result of the PBAR
                    Task Force (which stood for planning, budgeting, accounting and reporting) that
                    had concluded its work about that time, the documentation for both types of
                    programs was unified and a third document in the project cycle, the Program
                    Review Proposal (PRP), was added. The Latin America bureau—as was probably true
                    of other regions in the Agency, too, but Latin America had a larger loan
                    portfolio than any other region at the time—was going through a massive catch-up
                    exercise of reviewing both the project papers for its fiscal 1975 program at the
                    same time it was reviewing the PRPs for the fiscal 1976 program. So, the folks
                    in the Latin America Bureau was overwhelmed with this work.</p>
                <p>Through my colleague there I was able to make contact with someone who was to be
                    a very important person in my AID career, Marshall “Buster” Brown. Buster at the
                    time was the head of Development Finance in Latin America Bureau's Development
                    Resources office. I had a meeting with him about my interest in changing from an
                    assignment to Laos to an assignment in the Latin American Bureau. Apparently the
                    Latin American Bureau had gotten in trouble for doing similar kinds of things
                    with the IDI class before mine, so Buster basically said that if I could get out
                    of the Laos assignment they would make a place for me in Latin America, but he
                    wasn't going to do anything to pull from his end because they had done that the
                    previous year and Personnel had gotten on their case. They were going to be
                    neutral in this case, but would take me if I could get out of the Laos
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>That was all the opening I needed. I had a series of discussions with people in
                    the East Asia bureau, and not surprisingly the head of the Laos desk, Mary
                    Huntington—someone who I subsequently worked with in a different capacity—was
                    quite opposed to this, as I suppose I would have been under similar
                    circumstances. The IDI program directors, Shirley Marino and those who worked
                    with her, were somewhat sympathetic, but I don't think they could be so
                    officially because it violated the way the whole IDI program was set up at the
                    time. I was able to get an appointment one evening with Norm Sweet, who was
                    either the assistant administrator or the deputy assistant administrator of the
                    East Asia Bureau, and talked to him about my concerns about the Laos program and
                    how that wasn't what I really had joined AID to do. He made a comment which
                    probably turned out to be quite accurate, that the kind of program we had
                    underway in Laos was really the wave of the future, that we would be doing a lot
                    more of those kinds of things than the traditional development work and that he
                    thought my diagnosis of the situation was therefore wrong. However, he basically
                    said that if I really wanted to go, he wouldn't stand in the way of my leaving.
                    And, so I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>In March, 1975, I transferred to the Latin America region and, of course, in May,
                    1975 the Laos mission was evacuated and the program closed down. It was one of
                    those near misses that we talk about a lot. Had we actually gone ahead and gone
                    to Laos, we would have been in transit when the program was closed down and had
                    all the difficulties that would have been caused with the house rented and
                    household effects on the high seas and being without an assignment. So, my
                    change to Latin America was a good thing immediately.</p>
                <p>The key lesson I took from that experience is that, in the agency, people's first
                    impressions or their initial assignment is tremendously important. I went on to
                    have a highly successful and exciting year and a half in the Latin America
                    Bureau in Washington working with Buster and Dick Seifman, who was the head of
                    the South America Finance Division, and it made all the difference in my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job specifically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I was a loan officer, a project development officer, and the job was
                    largely to review proposals that were coming in from several South American
                    missions. I was given oversight responsibility for two or three countries,
                    including Paraguay and Brazil. The last funding for Brazil was in 1974, but
                    there was a huge portfolio of activities that were still being implemented. I
                    had one other country too, Chile or Peru, I don't remember which. I had been
                    with the agency only for about six months, but was given responsibility to
                    backstop several countries and to be the point person to review project
                    proposals that came in from those countries. It was a tremendous opportunity to
                    learn the agency, because in the 18 months that I was there I saw virtually the
                    whole cross session of activities that AID financed in Latin America in those
                    days. I was in a very nurturing environment where people gave me a lot of
                    responsibility. I went on a couple of project development missions to Uruguay
                    and to Paraguay, as well as a TDY to review the Brazil program. It was really
                    one of the best experiences a young officer could have. I thought at the time,
                    and still think, that the boost from that first 18 months as an IDI gave me a
                    lot of momentum to get through several rough spots later on in my career. For
                    the first ten years, it was enough of a boost to get me through what turned out
                    to be a fairly steep trajectory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any projects of note that you remember having
                        worked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:One that I worked on was an agribusiness or agri-industry project in
                    Uruguay. It was about that time, in 1975 or early '76, when a brief window
                    opened for an AID program in Uruguay. Things had been pretty dicey there in the
                    late '60s and early '70s with the Tupamaros and the murder of Dan Mitrione, and
                    the AID program had been closed out for a while. But there was a period of time,
                    just a couple of years, before Uruguay was graduated from assistance, that three
                    or four loans were developed, and one of those was one I worked on, which was an
                    agri-industry project.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I think there was a similar program in Paraguay that I did some work on, although
                    most of the rest of what I was doing was more on the review side and semi-annual
                    portfolio reviews and those kinds of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular thing you were suppose to be
                        looking for in these reviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:There was a whole check list of questions and issues about what project
                    proposals should contain that were identified in the new Handbook III that was
                    just being written at that time. Again, I think it was valuable to my early
                    career to have had an opportunity to look at a variety of proposals from the
                    standpoint of the whole range of feasibility issues that AID considered
                    necessary as part of the program. We were looking not only at the economic and
                    financial aspects but the social, technical, institutional and administrative
                    aspects of the program. The focus was on feasibility issues: was the project
                    going to work? What was the basis for believing that this particular project was
                    going to be successful? At the time, we did not focus on some of the things that
                    I have later come to think are quite important, such as the degree of commitment
                    and understanding and participation of local officials and people in those
                    programs. There was probably more lip service then a lot of real attention given
                    to analysis of social questions. These were mostly still loans. A lot of the
                    projects in those days were capital assistance. Funds for road construction or
                    other kinds of construction, or credit funds for a variety of purposes. Often
                    times there would be a grant element integrated with it and in that respect the
                    Latin American branch felt, and I did too, that they were in the lead within the
                    agency in combining grant and loan elements into an integrated project.</p>
                <p>It was a very busy, but a very fascinating period of time. Subsequently, I
                    occupied the position that Buster occupied in 1975 when I came into the LAC
                    Bureau, and I remembered those days and tried to do what I could do to make sure
                    that the initial assignments of other new IDIs were ones that gave them the
                    sense of responsibility, a good overview and grounding in the program, and some
                    real confidence in their role and their ability to make a difference that was
                    given to me. The notion that even some 25 or 26 year old off the street could be
                    listened to and could make a significant contribution to AID development
                    programs was something very empowering, as was the accountability and the
                    delegating of responsibility. Well, I had all that in a major way and I think
                    both Buster and Dick Seifman were tremendous influences on me in those early
                    years and gave me a boost which lasted a long time.</p>
                <p>First overseas assignment in USAID/Bolivia - 1976</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>In October, 1976, we went to Bolivia. Bolivia had been my father's first
                    assignment in what was to become an 18-year AID career. Bolivia was a very
                    special country for me and it remains so. I was really fortunate that a position
                    came open in Bolivia and that I was able to go there for our first overseas
                    assignment. I was graduating from the IDI program at that point so it was
                    actually a permanent position. We spent a little over two years in La Paz where
                    I worked in the projects office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in having a program there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Bolivia was one of the largest AID programs in Latin America at that time.
                    It was a fairly broad program. There were education activities, a large
                    agriculture program, a number of credit projects in which I played a more
                    significant role, large health, population, maternal and child care (called
                    child survival activities later on), but also a large engineering program of
                    mostly road construction and rural electrification, and a housing guarantee
                    program. I don't recall specifically, but I am sure there were Food for Peace
                    programs there, too. So, it was a large program with a large variety of
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time of the Alliance for Progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:This was in 1976. I guess the Alliance was still officially on the books
                    but it was fading a bit.</p>
                <p>The area in which I worked most directly was agricultural and rural development
                    programs, and on a variety of credit programs that we were funding. We had a
                    couple of credit programs for small businesses. We had just started up a
                    productive credit guarantee program, which was a new initiative in the Latin
                    American region, 1976-77, and the project in Bolivia was one of the first of its
                    kind. In a couple of cases, I was the design officer and later the project
                    manager. The finance programs that we had with the central bank, that didn't fit
                    into any of the traditional technical offices, were turned over to our office,
                    the project development office, for implementation and those were the ones that
                    I worked on.</p>
                <p>We also had a number of agricultural projects with credit components. There was a
                    community development program, an agricultural credit program, and a
                    colonization program, each of which had credit components. One of the things I
                    tried to do was get a whole picture of the credit programs that AID was
                    assisting in Bolivia and look for ways to make sure that they were working
                    together, or that at least they were consistent. As I look back on all that,
                    with the benefit of experience and hindsight, some of the things that we were
                    doing or hoping to do were not destined to succeed. Separate credit funds with
                    subsidized interest rates, central bank discount lines and those kinds of
                    things, have now been shown to be ineffective at reaching the people who were
                    our “target groups” and unsustainable.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, most of them included subsidized interest rates and a series of
                    special eligibility criteria. A lot of these credit programs were not really of
                    interest to private banks. Some of them were, and that is one of the things we
                    were working on. But, the whole notion of special credit funds with lower
                    interest rates, of course, as experience there and elsewhere has shown, really
                    tended to be misdirected towards people who were better off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they intended for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:They were intended for smaller businesses or small farmers. And, of course,
                    subsidized interest rates were based on the belief that small businessmen and
                    farmers couldn't pay the higher rates. Of course, experience has proven that not
                    to be the case. It has also shown that those special funds tend to be diverted
                    to those who have other influence with the banking system and can subvert them
                    and the eligibility criteria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that apparent to you at the time you were working on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:No. I suppose it was new at that time. In 1973, AID had done the spring
                    review of agricultural credit which I'm sure pointed out some of these things. I
                    actually carried a copy of the spring review report and paper around with me for
                    many years. But, I didn't really spend as much time as I might have looking
                    through and digesting this experience. I suspect a lot of this was identified
                    even then, in the early '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular factor that was driving them to
                        subsidize rates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SMITH:Well, it certainly was the government's policy at that time, and I think it
                    was AID's as well, to come up with special funds targeted on particular
                    individuals at preferential rates. I think that was pretty much the practice and
                    felt to be one effective way of reaching people who were outside the banking
                    system. But we had tremendous difficulties between the central bank and the
                    private banks that we were trying to encourage to participate in those programs.
                    A key issue was the role of a central bank, which performs a regulatory
                    function, also doubling as a development bank and trying to encourage private
                    banks to undertake particular kinds of lending programs through a discount funds
                    for specific kinds of things. It proved not to be particularly successful, and
                    the politics and the bureaucratics were not particularly suitable for the
                    central bank. The central bank really had much more of a regulatory mentality,
                    not the kind of facilitative, private sector mentality. So, there were a number
                    of clashes and difficulties, which meant that the funds were not only sometimes
                    being diverted to other uses, but in general were not being used as rapidly and
                    effectively as they might have been.</p>
                <p>The program in Bolivia also had a strong focus on childhood diseases,
                    immunizations. There was a family planning program there as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that well received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't recall. It wasn't something I was specifically engaged in. I don't
                    recall that there was a lot of controversy about it. As is true throughout Latin
                    America, there are a number of different influences on family planning programs,
                    but I don't recall that there was a particular opposition to the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think those programs were working better than
                        others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't know. I think they probably responded more, certainly than many of
                    the credit programs did, to what the Bolivian government wanted to do. There was
                    fairly broad support both from government and a variety of PVOs and NGOs for
                    working in those areas. So, in that respect— not that there weren't
                    difficulties—I think there was more coincidence of interest, commitment maybe,
                    in those areas than was true elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Education, which was another big program we had there, I think was less
                    successful. Education programs in Latin America tend to be a little more
                    controversial and you begin to get into issues like curriculum, teacher
                    incentives and other issues which can become quite politicized. Bilingual
                    education, which was a focus at the time, had a lot of issues. In the health
                    sector, I think this was true in Bolivia at that time and I think generally
                    probably true in lots of health programs in general, there is more of an
                    agreement on the need to do something, what to do and more of a commitment by
                    the people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a countrywide program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it actually get out to all parts of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I think so. My impression was that it was a fairly successful program. The
                    focus of the program was probably on the Altiplano, the highlands area of
                    Bolivia, which was the focus of much of our program there. That is also where
                    much of the infant mortality and maternal health problems were also
                    greatest.</p>
                <p>A couple of other impressions from those days. One of the projects that we were
                    supporting then was a colonization effort down in the lowlands, basically a
                    tropical forest area. It is interesting to think back on that now in light of
                    work I have done on environment programs and biological diversity and the whole
                    issue that emerged later on with tropical forests and the unsuitability of these
                    areas for permanent cultivation. But in the mid-'70s we were very much involved
                    in a colonization program down in the Santa Cruz area which was not especially
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:It was largely a project of building roads and infrastructure for
                    settlers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the settlers coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SMITH:They were coming mostly from the highlands where there was a lot of
                    pressure on agricultural lands from high population density. The idea in those
                    days, and I think to some extent unofficially and officially now, in the Andean
                    countries of Latin America, was that the tropical areas are a solution to the
                    overcrowding and poverty of the highlands. And, of course, this was the driving
                    view for that project. It was unsuccessful for all of the reasons that one can
                    now imagine. The lands were not particularly suitable for cultivation. The kinds
                    of crops that would grow there were not the kinds of crops that the people were
                    used to. The weather conditions were not the ones people were used to. You were
                    taking people who were used to living at 14,000 feet and putting them down at
                    1,000 feet in a tropical environment, clearing all the trees and trying to get
                    them to plant things. The technical, cultural and social issues were just
                    overwhelming. New bridges were being wiped out by flooding and access was cut
                    off from the area. There was a tremendous series of issues and problems. The
                    area today is probably settled and the people making a go at it the best they
                    can, but it was quite a struggle and something that probably was highly
                    questionable in view of environmental concerns that have become clear over the
                    last 20 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might have been done differently or not done at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I shouldn't have done it at all in retrospect. I think that the notion of
                    colonizing tropical forest areas is not a means of sustainable development.</p>
                <p>Those days, 1977-78, were the beginning of an issue which has characterized, even
                    dominated, the AID program in Bolivia ever since, and that is the whole coca
                    crop problem, the drug problem, cocaine from coca production, coca eradication,
                    coca crop substitution. During the time I was there was when the first crop
                    substitution programs were designed and put into effect. I think we were all not
                    under any illusions that we were going to be able to find a crop that competed
                    with coca economically. The real solution to the coca cultivation problem was
                    going to be a combination of demand reduction, actions in the US or wherever, as
                    well as enforcement actions there. And, of course, it was those things that were
                    lacking. In the absence of that, the efforts to grow pineapples or citrus fruit
                    could provide some additional income and perhaps a more diversified product mix,
                    but they weren't going to solve the drug problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did pursue crop substitutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. There was a strong imperative to do that. For people who were looking
                    for alternatives in the few areas where drug enforcement was working, substitute
                    crops did provide an alternative livelihood to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An alternative or complement? Did they really stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:In many cases they probably didn't stop. It was, I think, a vehicle for
                    getting resources devoted to development and adapting a number of crops which
                    were suitable for growing in those areas. To that extent, it was a useful
                    development program. But the context was the whole drug enforcement issue and
                    the commitment of the Bolivian government to it. Several of us felt that if the
                    drug issue was a way to get some money for development purposes for things that
                    could be useful, then that is great. After a couple of years it became real
                    clear that that was not the only reason for making funds available, there was
                    expected to be some true substitution, some enforcement and the program in the
                    late '70s began to get much more heavily criticized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:It meant getting the AID program a lot more interested in, if not involved
                    in, what was happening on the enforcement side...the military, the police and
                    DEA kinds of activities. And, it also meant the AID program began to be expected
                    to meet objectives that were more than just agricultural objectives, more than
                    just development objectives, ones that were linked to the actual substitution of
                    coca, not necessarily on a particular piece of land, but in general. And, of
                    course, what often happened was that a particular parcel on which the coca had
                    been destroyed may have been converted into something else, but then the next
                    parcel down would begin to be cultivated in coca. So, there wasn't any actual
                    decline in coca production, in fact quite the opposite. So, the standards by
                    which our programs were judged began to change from ones that had strictly to do
                    with the more usual development criteria, adapting of particular crops and
                    getting people to adopt them, to a much more political agenda. And, more and
                    more, especially after I left there, the whole crop substitution program became
                    much more a significant feature of the AID program in Bolivia than it was in
                    those days when it was just beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the other features of the program that we were
                        engaged in other than the crop substitution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, there was the health, education, construction, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in trying to reduce the demand for
                        coca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I wasn't and I don't think AID was involved during the time I was there. I
                    don't really know the extent that AID subsequently became involved in some of
                    those activities later, but political agenda is one that was just beginning to
                    emerge in the assistance program in Bolivia in the late '70s and is one that has
                    dominated our relationship with Bolivia pretty much since then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we certifying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The certification related to efforts by the government to eradicate or
                    reduce the area of coca being cultivated and also steps to address and stop the
                    transformation of the coca leaf into cocaine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the government on all these
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:It varied. In terms of the coca crop substitution programs, the part that
                    we worked on during my time there was really more on the research and extension
                    side. I think several people in the Bolivian government who were responsible for
                    that also saw it, if not a windfall, then certainly something that gave them
                    additional resources for doing research work on various crops in these
                    particular areas. At the time I was there we really didn't work with the
                    government on the enforcement issues.</p>
                <p>Working with the government in general is another point I wish to make. The
                    Carter Administration came in and was very interested in human rights and
                    democratic governments. This also began to affect the AID program indirectly in
                    that issues about elections and the form of Bolivia's government got introduced
                    as criteria effecting the size of the assistance program. Bolivia was in those
                    days a military dictatorship, but unlike most of its history, it had remained
                    fairly stable over a period of six of seven years to that point. That stability,
                    I thought, was beginning to pay off in terms of some of the economic goals and
                    social development as well. But, it was very important to the US government and
                    the Carter Administration that Latin American governments—governments throughout
                    the world— become democratic. I think that that pressure and using the AID
                    program as a tool in that pressure, was fairly significant and may have forced
                    the Bolivian government to have presidential elections a couple of years before
                    they were otherwise planning to do so. So, elections were held in 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of pressures were we applying?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SMITH:I think a lot of statements behind the scenes, certainly ambassadorial
                    statements, encouraging them to have elections and using as a carrot or perhaps
                    a stick the AID program as a way of stimulating them to move more quickly to a
                    democratic elected government than they might otherwise have been inclined to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were AID programs linked with the condition of having
                        early elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, it wasn't explicitly so at the outset, but it became a process where
                    more and more of those were linked. I have become a major fan of Jimmy Carter
                    and am also a life long Democrat, but in those days I felt that the rush to move
                    to a particular form of elected government ignored the importance of stability
                    in what has been historically a very unstable country, government-wise. In the
                    history of Bolivia there have been more governments than years of independence.
                    In that environment, I felt then—and feel that history has not proven me
                    incorrect—that moving too quickly could be too destabilizing and upsetting. But,
                    nonetheless, elections were moved up a couple of years ahead of the schedule
                    that was envisioned and the result of that was pretty disastrous for the next
                    ten or fifteen years in Bolivia and certainly for the remainder of the time I
                    was there. Elections were held in mid-1978. There were a lot of questions about
                    the elections and they were eventually annulled because of alleged
                    irregularities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we providing support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't recall that we were. I don't think so.</p>
                <p>The government candidate who ostensibly won the election then staged a coup and
                    took over the government and a few months later there was another coup against
                    him. This started the cycle of revolving doors that destabilized the country for
                    a number of years. The last six months or so that I was there, the last half of
                    1978, was a time of great uncertainty and instability and it was tremendously
                    difficult to get things done with the government. Even when there were three or
                    four months of a particular government there was a lot of shuffling of cabinet
                    ministers making it a very difficult and frustrating time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The elections were a destabilizing factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. I am certain there were issues of human rights with the Banzer
                    government. There probably was a growing involvement, which certainly became
                    much more pronounced later, of the military with drug trafficking. All of these
                    were important issues, but I think that the move to elections and Bolivia's
                    superficially symbolic return to democracy through the vehicle of elections
                    turned out to be destabilizing. I think moving from authoritative to democratic
                    rule in countries is not merely as simple as having elections. Just like
                    economic development requires a nurturing process to work, political development
                    requires a long term process that just did not seem to be recognized or
                    acknowledged there at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bolivia didn't have any prior democratic governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:There were a number of periods of times where there was democratic rule,
                    elected government. Particularly from 1952-64, after the Bolivian revolution in
                    1952, there were four year administrations and peaceful transitions from one
                    president to another. That ended in 1964 in the coup that kind of set up the
                    whole process for the next seven or eight years, and then led to the Banzer
                    years in 1971.</p>
                <p>Part of the problem in Bolivia was that a lot of the old players were still
                    around. The people who had been the leaders of the revolution in 1952 were still
                    the names in politics in 1978. These had been the people who had been the
                    presidents in the '50s and early '60s. Bolivian politics had not moved on,
                    matured or grown from the days of the revolution. After the revolution the
                    leaders broke up into various little factions. So, there was really no next
                    generation of politicians that had an interest in a more national consensus and
                    view. Politics was put into the deep freeze and when taken out was pretty much
                    the way it was when it was put in. There hadn't been any real development that
                    would allow things to change. And, on top of that you had the military as
                    another player and it was an extremely unfortunate and unstable time. I haven't
                    been close to Bolivian issues for a long time, but I think what you see now in
                    Bolivia is finally the emergence of a new generation of politicians and leaders
                    there. Siles Zuazo and Paz Estenssoro were the first presidents in the mid '80s
                    after the return to democracy and the period coincided with hyper-inflation and
                    a lot of other issues. It was after Paz Estenssoro's last term that new
                    leadership emerged. But, in 1978, that was not there. It was still in the old
                    days of revolutionary leaders and it was not an appropriate time. So, I think a
                    lot of advances we were helping to make in the development field were set back
                    enormously by the political instability that resulted from what I felt then and
                    still feel was premature urging of return to democratic government.</p>

                        of programs to the UN, donor communities, etc. because of bottlenecks; they
                        got out of that implementation role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:First of all I think there were several different threads to that. Most of
                    that probably occurred later, but there were elements of it that occurred then
                    and perhaps going back to the '50s and '60s with the servicios. In the '50s when
                    the assistance program started in Bolivia and other places like that, there was
                    no health ministry, no agriculture ministry, no education ministry. The
                    servicios, which were bilateral Bolivian and American organizations that brought
                    people from both countries together to focus on development issues, became a
                    nucleus around which those ministries formed. But in the early '60s when my
                    father was there, he was in an operational role together with counterparts. So,
                    there is that kind of history, not only in Bolivia, but in a lot of places,
                    where servicios were an implementing mechanism.</p>
                <p>But, even in the mid-'70s when we were there, there was a tendency—mainly because
                    of corruption and the inability of the formal government structure to carry out
                    programs because of its bureaucratic procedures and the length of time it took
                    to get things done—for a lot of the donor programs to create implementation
                    units for carrying out their projects. The World Bank and others had special
                    units set up outside the official government structure to administer the
                    projects they were financing. These perhaps were useful devices for implementing
                    projects, but certainly did nothing for mainstreaming and internalizing or
                    allowing for project activities to become models for anything that the
                    government did more generally. They, in fact, created a feeling of competition
                    because often these implementation units were able to pay people higher
                    salaries, had all the equipment, vehicles, etc. There was a vast difference
                    between that and what the run-of-the-mill ministry had, so they created
                    resentment and competition instead of cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a lot of experience working with Bolivian people.
                        How did you find them to work with inside and outside the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SMITH:The Bolivians were somewhat frustrating to work with. I think it was often
                    difficult to work with a lot of the government officials. Bolivia had a real
                    undercurrent, that sort of came closer to the surface sometimes more than
                    others. It was sort of an anti-Americanism. Going back to my childhood and
                    thinking more recently about the impact of this on my career and life and
                    perspective of Latin America, growing up in Latin America I was part of a fairly
                    privileged American family and working for the government. But seeing those
                    radical differences that I mentioned earlier about rich and poor made me
                    somewhat receptive to the ugly American kind of caricature and also the image
                    that many Latin Americans had and probably still have of the United States, and
                    their sense that their relationship with the United States is as kind of
                    second-class citizens. I think a lot of the difficulty in getting along with a
                    number of Bolivians officials and others was reflective of that. That sort of
                    chip on the shoulder. The feeling of second-class citizen. The feeling of being
                    pushed around by Uncle Sam. And, of course, some of the things that I mentioned,
                    the drug programs and the timing of elections, didn't do much to sway them from
                    those views. So, I think there was an element of that.</p>
                <p>Another element was corruption. I must say it was not something I particularly
                    focused on a lot at the time, but certainly there was some of that emerging and
                    there was a lot of probably agreeing to things that they really didn't agree
                    too. A lot of subversion, probably in smaller ways, not massive padding of bank
                    accounts out of the country. This type of thing made for difficult
                    relationships. After the aborted elections in 1978, the revolving doors of
                    officials you dealt with just made things very difficult.</p>
                <p>Against that, I must say working in Bolivia was actually one of the better places
                    that I have worked. There is a whole fabric of institutions in Bolivia that
                    really resulted from a long involvement with the US assistance program. I
                    mentioned earlier the servicios and how they evolved into sort of mainline
                    ministries of education, health, agriculture. This is also true of the private
                    sector. The whole savings and loans system in Bolivia was really a result of a
                    series of housing guarantee programs and work with AID over decades. The person
                    who was the head of the savings and loans system when I was there was somebody
                    who had worked in AID in the early '60s and, in fact, was a friend of my parents
                    from the time they were there, Ernesto Wende. So, he was someone who knew AID
                    from the inside. In fact, what you had there in Bolivia, this kept coming up
                    time and time again, were people who had spent a number of years working as
                    Bolivian officers in the AID mission and then going out and becoming significant
                    fixtures in the private sector institutional fabric of the country. So, at one
                    level there were some difficulties in dealing with people, but on another level
                    it was very nice because there was a whole institutional connection with AID
                    that had grown up over the years. AID helped create the industrial bank and
                    several other institutions in the private sector. Agricultural cooperatives,
                    savings and loans, were really the creation of AID and Bolivian projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Working in the mission was very good too because you did have Bolivian employees
                    for whom working with AID was their career. So, you had some people who had seen
                    all of the coming and going of us folks who were there for two or four years,
                    but they had been there for 15 or 20 years themselves and were able to be a
                    source of continuity and institutional history of what worked and what didn't
                    work. They were just very, very good people.</p>
                <p>So, there were some difficulties at a certain level, but by and large, I think,
                    working there was a very positive experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much opportunity to get acquainted with the
                        rural population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Not really very much. I think one of the main issues for AID is the extent
                    to which we live protected lives, insular lives, in the countries where we work.
                    Some people are able to reach out more than others, but in general, I think,
                    that the commissaries and privileges that we have access to really insulate us
                    from understanding the countries in which we live. My own feeling, too, was that
                    being an official in an aid giving organization always created at least some
                    suspicion about why people from the country wanted to know you, whether they
                    were expecting to get something from it. It made it very difficult in many cases
                    for me to form friendships or relationships with people. And, certainly, getting
                    to know the circumstances that affect the livelihood of the vast majority of
                    urban or rural poor is very difficult. A symbol of that which I always thought
                    was a move in the wrong direction, although I personally benefitted from it in a
                    number of ways, was after the passage of the Foreign Service Act in 1980 all AID
                    people suddenly got black passports and became diplomats. The official passport
                    was separation enough from what was going on in the country, but when people
                    then thought of themselves as diplomats too, I think it made it very difficult
                    to really get much of a feel for the country in which they were living. I think
                    that remains a major structural obstacle to AID development work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SMITH:But, the embassy had a different role. The embassy's role I have always
                    seen as being sort of the outpost of the United States in country X. Their role
                    is to look at developments from the US perspective or in many cases, to serve
                    customers who are Americans through visas, business people, etc. Certainly some
                    understanding of local cultures and peoples and what is going on is important to
                    that, and I think they are insulated from that kind of understanding too. AID's
                    role, I feel, and I am not sure how generally this is shared, is very different.
                    Its role is not to be looking out for US interests, but one that tries to
                    understand the perspectives of the country and peoples and how we can form a
                    partnership with them to help them improve their lives and conditions so that
                    over time there will be that partnership, an acknowledgment that the US helped
                    them improve their situation. That is what is in our benefit. We don't take
                    those measures with short term political or other interests in mind. That
                    principle has gotten violated a lot over my career and has been one of the
                    things that has gotten me crosswise with the prevailing winds of the agency.
                    But, I believe that firmly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But AID is an instrument of foreign policy. How do you
                        draw the distinction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The instrument that it is, is a long term instrument. It is one that helps
                    to create conditions in countries which will be in the long term interest of the
                    United States. And, forming partnerships with people of all levels of society
                    helps to create a favorable impression of the our people and values and what our
                    country stands for. That is what I think the foreign assistance program
                    contributes to foreign policy, not that it influences this week's vote in the
                    United Nations, not that it helps a country take our side in some international
                    dispute, not that it will now do things that are more beneficial to US business
                    interests in the country, but that over the long range what will emerge from our
                    assistance efforts is an independent country, one that is confident in its own
                    voice, feelings and interests and which recognizes that there was a mature
                    partnership that existed between our two countries and is at a level that is so
                    fundamental that you don't begin to question their basic loyalty. That there
                    will be differences on votes in the UN or positions taken on particular issues,
                    but the underlying friendship and loyalty and sense of partnership that exists
                    among the countries is there. That is what I think US foreign assistance
                    contributes to US foreign policy, not any of the short term issues which I have
                    already mentioned and others that I will mention later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we will come back to that towards the end. Is there
                        anything else on the Bolivia experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SMITH:No, I think the only other thing that I would mention is just in terms of
                    my own career and how that was developing. I went to Bolivia just out of the IDI
                    program and was the most junior American member in a five (US) person project
                    development office. But through a variety of circumstances, for most of the last
                    year that I was there I was the acting chief of the office. I began to play a
                    management role and think more about management issues. Any kind of “acting”
                    role is frustrating because you were by definition down a person or two, and we
                    definitely were that during those times. Being shorthanded, recruiting and
                    hiring became part of my more formal role during the last year I was in Bolivia.
                    Being thrust into these broader responsibilities was partly responsible for my
                    quick rise in the organization over the first several years.</p>
                <p>As I look back to my time in Bolivia, there was a tremendously good group of
                    Americans who were there at the time. Bolivia had one of the biggest and most
                    diverse programs in AID at that time, but it was to some extent a backwater
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a program was it? What kind of scale are we
                        talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I think $35-50 million a year in the mid '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. It had a US direct hire staff of about 35 when I first went there. As
                    I look back at the names of some of the people who I worked with during my two
                    years there and who became friends and colleagues throughout the rest of my
                    career, it is an impressive list of folks, many of whom are either now or were
                    mission directors or deputy directors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:In the agricultural office Dan Chaij, who was later Director in Costa Rica,
                    was the head of the office. Bastian Schouten was his deputy and Steve Wingert,
                    who also became Mission Director in Costa Rica, was working on cooperative
                    programs. In our project development office were Kevin Kelly (who became
                    Director in Panama), Ed Kadunc (who has been AID Rep in Colombia and Brazil),
                    Mike Deal (currently the Deputy Director in the Dominican Republic). In the
                    program office, George Lewis, who is now director in Rwanda, Howard Handler,
                    Dick Archie. Our lawyer there was Chuck Costello, who has been mission director
                    in several countries. So, a tremendous number of people, many of whom were just
                    starting out their careers as well. Steve Wingert, Bastian Schouten, Ed Kadunc,
                    Mike Deal, Chuck Costello were on their first tour. It was a good group of
                    people and actually one that would be really difficult to replicate today I am
                    afraid.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't know. Possibly because of the program that it was. The size made it
                    more likely to attract those kinds of people. But, also I think it was perceived
                    as a good development program. Other than that I really don't know. But, it is
                    interesting that so many people who later became very successful had their first
                    tour in Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your perspective from the field about what AID
                        was trying to do, how it was being managed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't know that I had any big perspectives in terms of how AID was being
                    managed. There was a change of administration during that time. But, I am not
                    sure I had much of a perspective on big management issues. The agency had just
                    gone through this PBAR exercise where it had shifted around its formats and
                    documents for programs to unify a system of loans and grants. So, that was kind
                    of in the digesting phase, there wasn't a lot of new work on management systems
                    that was being done. We were trying to make the new system work, so in terms of
                    systems and things there wasn't much turmoil in those days, although there had
                    been earlier and would be later on. I think the major change in terms of
                    emphasis of agency level or US level over the years was this emphasis on
                    democratic governments and human rights that the Democratic administration
                    brought in and then also the focus on drug issues, which was not partisan at
                    all, but something that was part of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Transfer to USAID/Haiti - 1979</p>
                <p>SMITH:In January, 1979, we left Bolivia and went to Haiti. I had had some
                    discussions that fall about a transfer from Bolivia as things had gotten a
                    little unstable in Bolivia. I had also been the acting office director for a
                    while and that was starting to get old without any real sense of whether that
                    was going to be a permanent promotion or not. That combination of things
                    prompted me, despite my affection for Bolivia, to think about moving some place
                    else. So, I had had some discussions with the Bureau and the outcome of that was
                    a transfer to Haiti as the head of the project development office in
                    Port-au-Prince.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH:Well, I guess primarily because it was there. It was what was offered and
                    the job was a good job. It was a move to an office director position. Also
                    because Haiti was another poor country and that was what I was interested in
                    focusing on. I didn't know much about Haiti before I went there. I had had a
                    little French in college and thought that would help. That proved to be not too
                    helpful. It seemed like an interesting place to go and certainly one where you
                    could identify quite readily, as one could in Bolivia, with why you were there,
                    from a development standpoint. So, we went.</p>
                <p>My youngest son was born during that move. My wife and older son had gone to
                    Texas to stay with her folks after we left Bolivia. My youngest son was born in
                    March so they came and joined me in Haiti in April. So, I was there by my self
                    the first three months. That actually wasn't too bad. I took some French classes
                    the first month I was there and spent a lot of time just getting adjusted and
                    acclimated to the new program and a very new culture and very different kind of
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, Haiti was like no place I had ever been before. Even having traveled
                    in Africa, it was not that. It was a difficult place to get to know. Unlike in
                    Latin America where I had grown up and knew the language and my way around and
                    to some extent could be mistaken for someone from that country by my appearance,
                    in Haiti there was none of that. There was no question but that you were a
                    foreigner. The culture was something that was different and it really took us
                    about a year of being there before we really felt comfortable. Not because of
                    crime or because we felt in a dangerous situation, but because just walking down
                    the street you obviously stood out and people in the market or on the street
                    would sort of yell out to you and that kind of thing. They did this not in a
                    threatening way, although when I was first there and not familiar with the
                    language and culture, I was never quite sure what was going on. So, it really
                    did take us a long time to adjust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:One looked at the government situation from two perspectives, I suppose.
                    From the perspective of the time, it wasn't good, it wasn't bad. It certainly
                    was better than it had been. In 1979, Jean-Claude Duvalier had been president
                    for three or four years, “Papa Doc” had died. There was a feeling of optimism of
                    an opening, that things were getting better. I think that was true. A number of
                    people, particularly younger professionals who had spent a lot of years in exile
                    in the States or elsewhere in the Caribbean were coming back to Haiti and
                    setting up businesses. Things generally were looking up. Certainly when one
                    looks at Haiti in retrospect, the time that we were there from 1979-81, was
                    probably close to the golden years of the last half century. We kind of hit it
                    at the peak because things had begun to go down by the time we left.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>On the other hand, a few years is not a long time to change a lot of the internal
                    practices, beliefs and culture and the government. The government was viewed as
                    being very ineffective, not caring particularly about the people of the country
                    or its development, quite corrupt in many different ways. The AID program had
                    started in Haiti about 1975 or 1976, so I was probably a second generation of
                    AID people to work in Haiti and got there just as many of the folks who had
                    opened up the program were beginning to leave.</p>
                <p>Some of the early programs, reflecting the development models of the time, were
                    with the government. But those were pretty uniformly not working very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of programs were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Again a range of things. Agricultural development programs, health and
                    population, road construction, some credit programs. The government programs
                    were really not going anywhere. There were tremendous implementation delays. So,
                    most of what we did in terms of new projects, or even redesigning some of the
                    old projects, was to work with private voluntary organizations, PVOs. There was
                    a big Food for Peace program there...child feeding programs and school feeding
                    programs...with large involvement from CARE and Catholic Relief Services. So,
                    the main strategic approach that we took during the time that I was there was to
                    work much more with non-governmental groups and to put together programs that
                    would in effect bypass the government. And, of course, that became a much
                    stronger theme in the Haiti program following that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, it depends how you define “work”. It probably worked better in terms
                    of getting specific individual projects going and achieving their own aims. Did
                    it have much of a significant impact on Haiti and Haitian development in
                    general? Probably not. It was hard to tell because of what happened in the
                    country after that time. Beginning in 1980-81 Jean-Claude Duvalier and his
                    government became much more corrupt and much more insulated and began the
                    downhill slide which led to his leaving his “life presidency” in 1986, which led
                    to another period of great turmoil there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the voluntary agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SMITH: A lot of them were church groups that would have one project. But they
                    were out there. They were the network that was providing whatever services were
                    being provided. So, I think that the private agencies were pretty effective at
                    reaching people. Again, maybe more on an anecdotal and not a systematic basis,
                    but nonetheless I think they were successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they just providing services or were they trying to
                        build any kind of community capacities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The latter. I think there was a lot of attempt to try to build capacity, to
                    develop community organizations. Not all of them, obviously, but I think by and
                    large there were major attempts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea how that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, again, at a local level, I think it worked fairly well. Some of the
                    larger programs were carried out by CARE, which not only had the food programs
                    but had its own development programs that focused on handicraft and agricultural
                    development. That was pretty effective I think, although in a limited kind of
                    way, not with any really discernible national benefits probably. Again, as the
                    political situation deteriorated throughout the '80s it limited any further
                    impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the local initiatives sustained or did they
                        deteriorate as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:One of the programs that I am most pleased to have been involved in was in
                    Haiti. There was and is a major problem in Haiti with deforestation, in fact,
                    almost the whole country has been deforested for charcoal and other uses. A
                    major effort of ours during the time I was there, and I think it still remains a
                    major focus of the program, was on trying to do something related to tree
                    planting. We wanted to try to do that by creating agriforestry activities where
                    farmers could raise their own trees for fuel and other uses and also, to some
                    extent, begin to reverse the deforestation trend, although that was probably a
                    little more ambitious. So, we put together an agriforestry program that really
                    has become quite successful and I believe even now with the revival of the
                    assistance program in the last couple of years is still going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the features of that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, again it involved exclusively private organizations and there were
                    three different aspects to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were international organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Some were international and some were local, although most were
                    international. One feature was working with CARE and the organizations they were
                    working with in the northwestern Haiti to help introduce agriforestry into their
                    development programs. The planting of fast growing trees, and that kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>A second component was to create a clearing house or a mechanism, a channel to
                    fund small community level projects that international or local NGOs would want
                    to carry out. A program office was created by the Pan American Development
                    Foundation; it ultimately ran that program, which was basically a
                    wholesale/retail operation where AID provided the funds to PADF and PADF then
                    retailed those out to small community projects throughout the country.</p>
                <p>A third component was a nursery component, working with an American who had come
                    down to Haiti as a semi-missionary, semi-private businessman: “Operation Double
                    Harvest”. He had developed a technique for growing seedlings which was much
                    quicker and much less cumbersome than the traditional big-black-bag-full-of-dirt
                    approach. A sort of cone approach which got the root structure the right way and
                    could be done using little forms that he had developed. So, we provided some
                    funding for him to expand some of his nursery operations for growing the
                    seedlings that were then used by the community organizations and CARE in other
                    parts of the program. I think the project has been a tremendous success, at
                    least in terms of numbers of trees planted, which is something given what the
                    history in Haiti had been up to that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the incentive to the people to plant the trees
                        and then preserve them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The incentive was that they owned them, unlike the situation with a lot of
                    the forests that existed there. They owned them, planted them on their own. They
                    were fast growing trees, so theoretically they could begin to get some benefits
                    from them fairly quickly. The seedlings themselves were either given away or a
                    small amount was charged. Then there was some assistance provided in the care
                    and nurturing of the seedlings. But, it was intended to be an effort that was
                    driven by a farmer's desire to have the trees. It wasn't a government agency
                    going out and planting trees on community land, but an activity that was started
                    by a decision of the farmer that he or she wanted to plant something on their
                    land. They owned the trees. It was not community wood lots. It was a commercial
                    effort on the part of the farmers' themselves.</p>
                <p>I think that is illustrative of the kinds of interesting things that we did and
                    one of the programs that I was involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything in health and education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:There wasn't much in education. Part of the problem with education was the
                    language and we really didn't have much in the way of French and certainly not
                    Creole expertise to offer for the education system. And, like other places,
                    there was great sensitivity about curriculum and the history of Haitian
                    education was more derived from the French system anyway than the ones we were
                    familiar with.</p>
                <p>Health, there again were major programs in mother and child health and family
                    planning. Much of them through private organizations, too. Some of that was with
                    the government agencies as well. There was a small program that was begun for
                    small business, micro enterprise assistance. We did a lot of work on that when I
                    was there. Helped to create the Haitian Development Foundation which was similar
                    to the similarly named organizations in other Latin American countries. We also
                    did a lot of research work on small businesses in Haiti as a foundation for
                    future programs in this area..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:There were some results, but again several years later there were a number
                    of problems with the Haitian Development Foundation, corruption and leadership
                    issues, which undermined some of those efforts. Unfortunately, I think we took
                    more of a top down institutional development approach than supporting an
                    organization that emerged from the communities or clients it was intended to
                    serve. I think that gap in perception and culture was one that was difficult to
                    overcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of the overall Haitian program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't really recall but it was probably in the neighborhood of $20
                    million a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the food assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. There was PL 480 Title II assistance but also some PL 480 Title I
                    programs as well. So, to that extent there was an economic policy aspect to the
                    program and a lot of reform efforts devoted to the national flour mill and its
                    pricing policies and those kinds of things. So, it was a pretty
                    multi-dimensional program from that standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the US interested in putting that much money into
                        Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SMITH:I think there were a couple of motives. One, the initial one after
                    Jean-Claude Duvalier became president and things seemed to be getting better,
                    was the absolute poverty and the gap between Haiti and Florida which is only an
                    hour and a half flight away. So there was a more altruistic desire to do
                    something in the country. But a dimension of that situation, which and became
                    much more prominent during my time there, was the phenomenon of the boat people.
                    When boat loads of Haitians began to wash up on the Florida shores it became a
                    major concern of the US government to address that and keep them there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What triggered that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, I think what triggered it was the economic disparities. The desperate
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had gotten worse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:For a variety of reasons, which I think were largely economic in that time,
                    the boat people situation became a major issue and a major concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing anything at that time to try to prevent
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Nothing directly. Again, the theory was that effective development efforts
                    would help to stem that, but of course that was a pretty tall order given the
                    magnitude of the problem. That was like drugs and democratic elections in
                    Bolivia and became the foreign policy issue having to do with the Haiti program.
                    The lack of results, in terms of reducing the flow of boat people, became
                    important for influential people in the Congress and therefore the
                    administration. In 1980 that became a major issue and Clarence Long in the
                    Congress took a hard line about cutting off assistance to Haiti unless something
                    was done to stop the boat people from leaving. It became a major issue whether
                    the AID program was doing anything in Haiti that was making an impact on this
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>That kind of set up what, for me, was one of those major defining events for my
                    career and in my life. At the end of 1980 there were presidential elections in
                    the US and Carter lost and Reagan won. The contrasts in the way that those two
                    administrations dealt with the issue of Haiti couldn't have been greater. I am
                    not sure the way I just said that it is accurate, actually, because I think it
                    boiled down more to individuals and their own particular perspectives on things
                    than to some disembodied “administration”. But, nonetheless, the approaches were
                    quite different and provided me some real insights into the effectiveness of
                    different management approaches to problems. When we were having these issues in
                    the summer and fall of 1980, before the election, Jack Vaughn was designated as
                    the assistant administrator for Latin America, although he was never actually
                    confirmed in that position. However, after having been designated he was sitting
                    in the office and anticipating being confirmed and moving into that job full
                    time.</p>
                <p>One of the big issues, politically, and one of the issues that he felt he needed
                    to address in his confirmation hearings was the boat people and the Haiti
                    development program. He made a trip to Haiti to discuss that with us. His
                    approach to it was extremely constructive, extremely respectful, a model of a
                    good management approach. I remember very distinctly meeting in the conference
                    room with him and his basically saying, “I have a problem and you have a
                    problem. You have a problem in Washington and my job is to try to help you solve
                    your problem there. It is a problem for me what is going on here but my problem
                    is going to be solved to the extent you are able to deal with your problem. So,
                    my role is to help you solve that problem. So, let's talk about how I see the
                    problem and how you see the problem and come up with something that we can do to
                    address these concerns and try to solve the problem.”</p>
                <p>Well, unfortunately, Mr. Carter lost the election. And Jack Vaughn was never
                    confirmed as the assistant administrator. The Haitian problem didn't go away.
                    But a few months later, without consulting us at all, in his confirmation
                    hearings, Peter McPherson, as administrator designate, allowed as how he was
                    very concerned that the Haiti program wasn't getting the results that he would
                    like from it and it would be one of his first orders of business to fix that
                    program. The way he then decided to implement that was to send a delegation of
                    four people to Haiti shortly thereafter to basically design an approach to solve
                    that problem. This was done in consultation with us, but they were the ones who
                    were empowered to come up with the recommendations. Needless to say, that was
                    the first of what were to be several run-ins or disagreements I had with the
                    Reagan administration and its conduct of AID business. I did not feel that that
                    was an effective way of dealing with the problem or of empowering the staff or
                    even respecting us. It took me a long time and many years, despite Peter
                    McPherson's positive contributions to AID, to form a positive image of him
                    because of the way that issue was handled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these appointees who came out or regular AID
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SMITH:Both. One was John Bolton, who was to become the head of PPC and General
                    Counsel. I think this was his first overseas trip or certainly his first trip to
                    a developing country. The other was a guy by the name of Sam Martinez, who was
                    also designated to be assistant administrator for Latin America, but actually
                    never made it to the confirmation process. Then there were Ed Coy and Phyllis
                    Dichter, who were the other two people. Ed was the acting AA for Latin America
                    and Phyllis was the deputy director of the Caribbean desk at that time.</p>
                <p>This episode left a mark on me in a number of different ways forever. It
                    highlighted for me some lessons for later management roles and also some lessons
                    about empowerment, trust, responsibility and interaction between the political
                    appointees and people on the ground.</p>
                <p>I think in the Haiti program in those days you had bright points. The
                    agriforestry project that I mentioned was probably the brightest of them all.
                    There were, in succeeding years, some other kinds of private sector development
                    programs that I think had a positive impact for a while, but I think the program
                    was defeated by the magnitude of the problem and the deteriorating situation
                    over the early years of the '80s and then complete chaos in the latter part of
                    the '80s. I don't know that there is a whole lot that would remain there from
                    those programs, with the exception of some of the voluntary agency programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from the government and the wealthy elite, what
                        impression did you have of the general population's view about development
                        as such? Was it something that they understood or wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:In certain pockets, but I think that there was an impressive lack of trust
                    and community spirit among people in Haiti, probably born out of a long history
                    of exploitation, particularly during the Duvalier years. Never knowing whether
                    you could trust your neighbor, tremendous exploitation, marginalized existence.
                    This really made working with people beyond family units, efforts to work
                    together in community organizations or efforts that would benefit more than
                    individuals, extremely difficult to do. There was a real sense of distrust, of
                    individualism. On the other hand, despite the obvious hardships and the
                    tremendous, almost indescribable poverty and conditions in which people lived,
                    there was a certain energy there, a certain entrepreneurship and creativity
                    there without which people would not have survived. So, there was something to
                    tap. But it was by far the most difficult situation and environment that I
                    worked in.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>There were a couple of threads in my Haiti experience that were also ones I
                    mentioned for Bolivia. In Haiti, as in Bolivia, although perhaps not so
                    widespread, I had the good fortune of working with a number of really good
                    people. Among them Aaron Williams and Stacy Rhodes, who are both mission
                    directors now in AID. Bill Rhoads was the assistant director and my direct
                    supervisor. Linda Morse, now director in India, was a recent IDI in the health
                    office. So, I had a good core of people, at least in my immediate circle, to
                    work with. This really helped in coming up with some of the programs that we did
                    and some of the approaches that we did to deal with the situation.</p>
                <p>The other is that, again, because of a series of transfers and moves and other
                    kinds of things over the two and a half years that I was in Haiti, I moved up
                    through the ranks, mostly on an “acting” basis. At the time I went there the
                    project development and the program offices were divisions under an assistant
                    director who was Bill Rhoads. In the end, we in the project development division
                    ended up doing a lot of the traditional program work, the strategies and those
                    kinds of things as well. Less than a year after I arrived in Haiti, Larry
                    Harrison, who had been the mission director, left and went to Nicaragua where he
                    became the mission director after the Sandinistas took over there. Al Furman,
                    who had been deputy director, became the mission director, and Bill Rhoads, in
                    effect, became deputy, although officially he remained “assistant” director.
                    When Bill left in early 1981, I became the acting assistant director, but
                    because of travel and illness, for most of the last couple of months I was in
                    Haiti I was the acting mission director. The first half of 1981 was tough. That
                    was when all of the business with the McPherson group was going on and I
                    probably took that more personally than I should have, but that was one of the
                    reasons it still sticks in my throat as much as it does. We were trying to make
                    things work as effectively as possible and I was just coming into a position of
                    broader responsibility in the mission and yet there was little willingness to
                    work with us, listen to us or even involve us.</p>
                <p>I was actually a candidate to be the permanent deputy director there in 1981, but
                    that did not work out. One of the things that happened when the Reagan
                    administration came in was a freeze on all transfers, in expectation expectation
                    of budget cuts. It looked as if I would be staying in Haiti for another two
                    years, which would have been okay, even if I hadn't become deputy director.
                    Things went back and forth for several months, and literally, it wasn't until
                    the day my wife and sons were leaving Port-au-Prince for what they thought would
                    be home-leave-return-to-post that the decision was made that we would be moving
                    back to Washington that summer of 1981.</p>
                <p>Return to USAID/Washington to the Development Resources Office for Latin America
                    - 1981</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SMITH:I came back to be the head of the Central America finance division in the
                    Development Resources Office in the Latin America Bureau (LAC/DR).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to where you had been before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:When I was there before I had been an IDI in the South America finance
                    division, and this time came back to head up the Central America finance
                    division, which I really looked on positively. I had worked in the South America
                    finance division, had lived in Bolivia and Brazil growing up, and had worked in
                    Bolivia, so felt I had a good feeling for South America. I had spent the last
                    two and a half years in Haiti, which while not entirely typical of the
                    Caribbean, gave me some sense of some of the development issues and questions in
                    that part of the region. But I had not been involved much with Central America,
                    so I looked to this as a way to kind of round out my experience in the region
                    and to build on the lessons and activities in other parts of Latin America and
                    bring them to bear on Central America. That was good in theory, and to some
                    extent it worked out pretty well.</p>
                <p>I think, though, that my timing was just off in terms of the kind of programs
                    that I wanted to become involved with. Here is where Norm Sweet's words, when I
                    was talking with him about the reasons I wanted to leave the Laos program and
                    move to the more development focus of Latin America, came back to ring true,
                    because 1981-82 saw the beginning of what were to be very protracted conflicts
                    and, very politicized AID programs in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and to a lesser
                    extent, Guatemala. There were massive amounts of resources as a result of the
                    Kissinger Commission, and a much greater focus on private sector development, on
                    economic support funds as part of our assistance programs throughout the region.
                    The Central American programs in those days probably resembled quite a bit the
                    Laos program of the early '70s.</p>
                <p>It was a difficult adjustment for me coming from Bolivia and Haiti and the kinds
                    of development issues we were dealing with there, to the much more politicized
                    environment of Central America. One of the symbolic events that really was
                    upsetting was when the US refused to provide disaster assistance to some flood
                    victims in Nicaragua because of disagreements that we had with the Sandinista
                    government. I think that was something of a symbol of the times and something
                    that was very unfortunate.</p>
                <p>As a result, during the two years I was in that position I ended up focusing
                    mostly on the Costa Rica program, and to some extent, Guatemala. I got very
                    actively involved in a lot of the finance and economic support programs that
                    Costa Rica was beginning to undertake at that time. This was the beginning of
                    the economic support program which became massive in the '80s, and I think
                    tremendously successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do with the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SMITH:It was really to help bring about some major structural reforms in the
                    Costa Rican economy. To orient the economy more to foreign trade and to free
                    markets and to the policies that would support non-traditional exports. To cut
                    back on government subsidies and budget deficits. Getting the policies and
                    incentives right for private investment. Trying to provide stimulus to
                    non-traditional exports from Costa Rica to the United States. Those were the key
                    elements of the economic support program there.</p>
                <p>In addition, those were the days of the tremendous debt problems that affected
                    Costa Rica, as well as much of Latin America and the developing world. I got
                    involved in a number of programs, including one with COFISA, a private
                    industrial finance corporation that AID had helped create in the mid-'60s and
                    had been a direct recipient of two or three AID loans. There was interest on
                    AID's part in preserving its investment and in in the payment on those loans,
                    which were still being made. We also hoped COFISA could become one of a number
                    of private financial mechanisms that could help finance and facilitate this
                    non-traditional export orientation. Other programs there included the creation
                    of a private export bank, and other banking, financial and technical assistance
                    facilities, which together would help support a new non-traditional export
                    structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we doing all of these things? Designing separate
                        projects for each one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:A lot of it was done with separate projects and a lot of it was done with
                    local currency generations from the ESF programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in local currency programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were approved in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SMITH:They were approved in Washington in a general way as part of the overall
                    economic support program packages. I went down to Costa Rica three or four times
                    during this period on TDY to work with the mission to help design some of the
                    projects and ESF proposals. The director of the mission at the time was Dan
                    Chaij, and the deputy director was Bastian Scouten, both of whom I had worked
                    with in the Bolivia mission. We had a good relationship and I was able to play a
                    role from Washington in helping the mission to design some of those programs.
                    This opened up a whole new world to me, the private sector finance area. In
                    fact, I represented AID at a couple of meetings between COFISA an its creditors
                    about rescheduling their debts. This was quite a new experience for me and added
                    a new dimension to the development work that I certainly hadn't had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these meetings with local or US businesses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were mostly commercial debts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes. Although, the treatment of the US government debt through the AID
                    loans was part of that whole process as well.</p>
                <p>So, that was a kind of interesting time in those couple of years. I also visited
                    Guatemala two or three times in a similar kind of role, working with their
                    programs from an AID/Washington backstopping standpoint, but also on a couple of
                    occasion helping to identify and put together new programs. One was to have
                    been—it didn't really take off—helping to establish a market for agricultural
                    lands that would allow large land owners to sell some of their underutilized
                    holdings and to allow small holders to purchase land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that to take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The idea was to do it through a commercial mechanism that would finance
                    both ends of the transaction and in a way try to begin to deal with the
                    tremendous disparity in land distribution in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Supply financing to the large holders and to the small
                        holders too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Right. But, in the end that was too radical an approach for Guatemala at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not accepted by the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The commitment of the government to that extent of land reform or asset
                    redistribution was not there and there were a lot of other issues—social,
                    political and economic—in Guatemala in the early '80s. This was the period when
                    the civil war was at its peak and there were civil rights abuses, killings in
                    indigenous communities, and the environment was not really conducive to
                    undertaking programs that had a longer term benefit or objective of evening out
                    the distribution of wealth in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there projects that you haven't mentioned that you
                        felt particularly interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:None in particular. I guess the other feature of those times was the whole
                    event of the Kissinger Commission, not that I played a particularly important or
                    big role in it, but because my responsibility was Central America, I was able to
                    work closely with the Central America desk and with the economic staff in the
                    Latin American bureau program office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you participate with the Commission at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes, in some of the early proposals for an expanded assistance program in
                    Central America that would take advantage of increased funds and increased
                    attention on Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the objective of the Kissinger Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Well, the objective was to deal with the insurgencies and the wars that
                    were going on at the time and I think, in a kind of cynical sort of way, to
                    support our “friends” through AID and development programs, many of which were
                    economic support programs aimed at broad economic policy reforms in those
                    countries, as well as, at least theoretically, trying to deal with some of the
                    underlying causes of the wars and conflicts in the region, the poverty that was
                    feeding those conflicts. In my view, the result of the Kissinger Commission
                    turned out to be a very superficial effort of throwing money at a problem, of
                    designing things in Washington in response to an administration, and to some
                    extent, Congressional interest in dealing with a hot war (as well as a cold war)
                    situation. It never really, in my view, adequately took advantage of the
                    potential for beginning to work with governments and others in Central America
                    to begin seriously to address the development issues that underlay a lot of the
                    region's problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have taken much more time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SMITH:It would have taken more time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Less money immediately.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes, and that is not what people are interested in. I think that was very
                    discouraging. Despite some things that I enjoyed working on in Guatemala and
                    Costa Rica, I felt the programs in Honduras, El Salvador, and especially,
                    Nicaragua were very politically driven. I know people who worked there, who I
                    respect and think highly of and they felt they were doing a good job, certainly
                    a necessary job. However, it hadn't been my interest in 1974 to become involved
                    in that kind of program, supporting short term political interests with regimes
                    which were not really carrying out programs that were in the best interests of
                    all their citizens, but just happened to be our “friends” or to speak like they
                    were, and I wasn't interested in doing that in 1982-83 either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think should have been done differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I think what should have been differently probably would have started at
                    the top. I think the prescription for the problems of Central America was not to
                    aid and abet by our assistance the ten years of war and conflict that occurred.
                    I think that that prescription should have been to recognize early on that there
                    were abuses on both sides, to recognize that the rebels in El Salvador and the
                    Sandinistas in Nicaragua, to a certain extent had a point about the past
                    failings of governments in those countries and that we were associated with
                    those past governments. We should have acknowledged that and moved on to try to
                    establish a more mature relationship with them that could have had more promise
                    in addressing the needs of people instead of feeding a war and a political
                    process which only now, ten or fifteen years later, the region is beginning to
                    emerge from. There was such a tremendous waste of resources and life and
                    opportunity in that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the people perceived it as a real threat to US
                        interests, the Cuban incursions, the influence, the communist threat, etc.
                        Didn't that drive our policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I suppose it did, but I don't subscribe to that particular view. Communism
                    clearly collapsed inward from its own weight. It was not a rival system that
                    would truly threaten our own or our values. Not that the idea of a “communist
                    threat” was made up, because I think people probably felt that strongly, but I
                    don't feel that there was ever a threat. In fact, this may be my radical
                    perspective from having spent my youth in Latin America, but there is a lot to
                    the leftist critique about the role the United States has played in Central
                    America and Latin America. By helping prolong the wars and by the approach that
                    we took to those problems in the '80s, we only further substantiated that view
                    of the US, in my opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any aspect of the Kissinger initiative and
                        resources that was effective in dealing with what the political issue was do
                        you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't know if they were effective in dealing with the political issue. I
                    do think that the focus that a lot of the AID programs took in those days on
                    economic liberalization, structural reform, structural adjustment was a correct
                    approach. Of course, most of these funds were provided for political reasons
                    fundamentally, and there were often setbacks when some economic policy
                    conditions weren't met and the funds were disbursed anyway. But, in the end I
                    think these programs and the policy dialogue that accompanied them created a
                    greater awareness of and capacity for economic analysis and a lot more
                    credibility for the free market, private sector led development approach. And I
                    think that was the correct one. And, I think too that in places like Honduras
                    and places like Costa Rica, which were kind on the periphery of the main act,
                    the quantity of resources and the development orientation of many of the AID
                    people, particularly in Honduras, meant that a lot of development activities
                    that wouldn't have been funded otherwise were able to get some resources. So,
                    there is a silver lining from that. There are resources that were well used and
                    have had a long lasting impact and I think the whole approach to economic policy
                    has also been positive in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Anything else on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I had been for two years working in the Central America area, and as
                    I mentioned before, focusing a lot of my personal efforts on Costa Rica and
                    Guatemala. One of the things that I was also doing was getting involved in a
                    fairly significant way in a lot of recruitment efforts that were underway, and
                    assignment decisions for project development officers in the Latin America
                    region. Each bureau had a representative who participated in the review of
                    candidates for the IDI program and also for any mid-level entry positions. In
                    the second year I was back in Washington I was asked to represent the Latin
                    America bureau in many activities related to the recruitment of new project
                    development officers. I regarded that as an important part of my job,
                    participating on the panels that reviewed candidates and interviewing candidates
                    in the selection process, particularly for IDIs, but also some mid-level
                    entries.</p>
                <p>In 1983, after having been back for a couple of years, I moved up to be the
                    assistant director for development finance in LAC/DR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a unit within LACDR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was basically the head of all of the project development offices. In
                    those days LAC/DR had a director and deputy director and two assistant
                    directors. The assistant directors respectively oversaw the project development
                    staff and all of the technical staff, which in the Latin America bureau were
                    part of LAC/DR office. The assistant director for finance oversaw the three
                    subregional project development offices as well as a private sector office that
                    had been created in the early '80s. It was the counterpart to the other
                    assistant director, who oversaw the technical offices that were part of the
                    office.</p>
                <p>The recruitment and staffing function was a big part of that job. While as the
                    Central America finance division chief I had been phasing into that role, when I
                    became assistant director that became more formally part of my responsibilities.
                    This was something I really enjoyed doing and to some extent was, I suspect, a
                    counterpoint to some of the frustrations and dissonance I had been experiencing
                    with the Central American programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were those things you enjoyed doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I really enjoyed the process of interviewing candidates, of talking to
                    people and of trying to think about the kinds of people who would be good for
                    the agency in the future. What kind of person would be successful? What kind of
                    person would bring the right combination of skills and attitudes to the job? In
                    a sense, trying to create the future generation of agency officers, officers who
                    would be good for the agency, at least as I saw it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the criteria that you were using?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: A good sensitivity for development issues from a technical standpoint, but
                    also for the communication, cross-cultural understanding, working with people in
                    different cultures. I was looking for experience like Peace Corps and other work
                    experience where people actually had an opportunity to work in cross-cultural
                    situations and to do well in that. But, there is also an almost intangible
                    notion of the personality, attitude and approach, of collaborativeness, a
                    positiveness, a willingness to work sometimes under adverse circumstances, but
                    in a positive and enthusiastic way. A lot of people have resumes or applications
                    that look very good and similar—in fact, one of the things that I often remarked
                    on was that given the quality of the candidates that we were looking at in
                    1983-84, I don't think I would ever have been competitive with that group had I
                    not come into the agency ten years earlier. It was a somewhat humbling
                    experience to look at the very vast, excellent experience that a lot of our
                    candidates had. But, to get a chance to talk to people, to interview them and to
                    get a sense of their personality and that kind of intangible fit, I think was a
                    really interesting part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a panel process was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. But, what I think I enjoyed most in this process was really working
                    with the people once they were hired to help the early part of their career go
                    well. Part of that was the more traditional guidance or career development role,
                    but part of it was looking for opportunities for them to play significant roles.
                    In this, of course, I drew a lot on my own experience that we talked about
                    earlier, where one of the things that gave my career a tremendous boost at the
                    beginning was to have responsibility and a very positive initial experience in
                    the agency. So, what I tried to do from that position was to give those kinds of
                    opportunities to the people who were coming into the agency at that time as IDIs
                    or mid-level hires.</p>
                <p>There was one specific thing we did at the time and I don't know if I had any
                    particular plan for it, but it turned out to be a very successful little
                    activity. During the same time I had been the Latin America representative on
                    several of the AID project implementation courses that were offered throughout
                    the world. In those days each bureau typically would send a representative to
                    the course that was held in their region, and I had done this a couple of times
                    and actually had done some of the sessions myself in the training course. As a
                    result of that, I had the materials for the project implementation course. In
                    1983 and early 1984, there was a fairly large number of people who were coming
                    into the Latin America bureau as IDIs or mid-level hires, not only project
                    development officers, but in some of the technical areas as well. So, we put
                    together a little lunchtime seminar series. There were about eleven or twelve
                    people who were in that status and about eleven or twelve topics that we drew on
                    from the project implementation course curriculum and other materials I had
                    collected. I was kind of the counselor or the resource person for that. Instead
                    of actually doing the course myself in the normal sort of lecture fashion, what
                    we basically did was to divide up the topics among the new people themselves, so
                    each of the IDIs or new hires took one subject on which they prepared the
                    training session with the materials that I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the topics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SMITH: They ranged from the procurement and contracting process to the project
                    design process, the evaluation process, developing scopes of work for contracts
                    or evaluations, the financial management and accounting side of things—basically
                    the curriculum that was in the two week project implementation course. Each of
                    the new people took one of those topics with the materials from the course and
                    supplemented by other things that I had available, then gave one of a series of
                    two-hour lunch time sessions on that topic. I think that combined two things.
                    Ideally, it transferred some of that information to people as they were
                    beginning to work with some of those project implementation issues. And it also
                    gave each of them an opportunity to go into depth in some area in order to
                    prepare their own presentation. I think it was a much better learning device
                    than having someone sit in front of a table full of people and tell them about
                    it, because it required each person to become a sort of instant expert in one of
                    those fields of implementation. The sessions were open not only for the people
                    who were this group of IDIs and mid-level hires but to anybody else who wanted
                    to attend. Obviously, there are certain drawbacks to having people who were not
                    subject area specialists give a presentation, but there were a couple of us
                    there to help support them with examples or clarifications or that kind of
                    thing. It worked very well. Several years later I got some good feedback from a
                    couple of the people who had participated in that little seminar series, who
                    told me they felt it was something of a model. Not only did it work very well in
                    terms of communicating some of the topical information, but as an approach it
                    was very good and a model for them.</p>
                <p>That was one of the highlights that I look back on during that period of time. I
                    think that is really symbolic or representative of the role that I tried to play
                    in those days vis-a-vis some of the new hires. Trying to give them more of a
                    nurturing environment and a supportive start to their careers.</p>
                <p>The other fun thing about that was that, mostly through the recruitment process
                    for IDIs, I had a handful, not very many people, who were at the top of my own
                    selection list who I pushed hard to get them to come into the agency, and they
                    did. Ten years or so later, looking at their careers and the success they have
                    had, sort of makes you pleased that in one small way you had something to do
                    with them coming into the agency and hopefully getting them set on the right
                    path. So, there are a handful of people who in a sense I have a fatherly image
                    towards, and it has been fun to watch their success.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SMITH: The three people that I most think of in that regard are Liz Warfield, who
                    was a project development officer in the Latin America region for several years
                    and is now working in the Asia Near East bureau. Carlos Pasqual, although I
                    never worked with him, was an IDI in that period and had an extremely successful
                    early career in the Africa bureau and then was one of the key people in the
                    former Soviet Union program. Maureen Dougan is the third, and again she has
                    spent most of her career in the Latin American region as a project development
                    officer, but more recently has been over in the Middle East in the Gaza West
                    Bank program and I think is now back in Washington, although I am not quite
                    sure. Each of them in their own way has been successful and it has been really
                    interesting for me to cross paths with them at different times over my
                    career.</p>
                <p>About this time there was a major turn in the road in my career. Despite what I
                    have just been talking about, the positive work with new employees, my
                    dissatisfaction or feeling of intellectual distance from the main thrust of the
                    Latin America program in the early '80s was growing to the point that I really
                    seriously considered leaving AID. In fact, I sent a resume to another
                    organization in response to a job advertisement. In putting together that resume
                    I went back through all of my annual performance evaluations of the previous ten
                    years as a way of recalling the things that I had done. And upon reflection, it
                    seemed that I had done reasonably well in my first ten years at AID and maybe
                    what I should do rather than leave was to try to see if there is another part of
                    the world where AID is doing more of the kind of development work that I was
                    personally interested in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Disenchantment related to the politicization of
                        projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. The politicization of the program, the emphasis on economic support
                    kinds of activity. At one level I don't have a conceptional or philosophical
                    problem with those sorts of programs, it is just not what I really enjoyed
                    doing. We had heavy emphasis in those days on private sector development. That
                    often meant programs, certainly in Costa Rica, for example, focused on big
                    businesses, the more established financial sector kinds of businesses. I am not
                    saying those are unimportant for development, it is just not what I personally
                    enjoyed doing and not what I had envisioned as my life's work. I think I had
                    done reasonably well dealing with those programs, as I mentioned before, but it
                    wasn't what I really wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a particular view about the role of private
                        sector, or was it just the nature of that particular activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SMITH: The private sector, the private business sector, is certainly a major
                    player, maybe the major player, in the end in development. I have had—and again
                    this goes back I suppose to my early formative years living overseas as a rich
                    American in impoverished countries— a real aversion to conspicuous consumption,
                    to working just to earn more money and that kind of motivation which, to some
                    extent, is much closer to the surface in the private sector then it is in
                    government service or the non-profit world. It is just not what I was, not what
                    I wanted to do. I had been involved in it in Haiti, Bolivia and elsewhere, in
                    small micro enterprise business development programs, and that sort of aspect of
                    the private business sector was more consistent with what I enjoyed doing. And,
                    of course, the private sector in its more generic sense includes the whole range
                    of private non-profit organizations and certainly that side of things is
                    something I very much believe in and support and wanted to work with. But, the
                    large finance companies and the large trading companies and trying to engage
                    medium to large size US businesses and to benefit them in a fairly explicit way
                    from our AID programs was not something I wanted to make my career doing.</p>
                <p>Through some former colleagues, and also through the contacts that I had made
                    with people in other bureaus from my activities related to recruitment and
                    project development officer assignments, I learned of a position that was open
                    in Swaziland. It was a combined program/project development officer position.
                    From my Haiti days, I had done a lot of program work, strategy development and
                    budget planning activities, so had some of that background and enjoyed that work
                    as well as more specific project design and oversight of project implementation.
                    There were a handful of countries in Africa that one hears about over the years
                    as being nice places to live and work and Swaziland was on that list. So, I
                    enquired a little further and made some contacts, and in the spring or early
                    summer of 1984, the deputy director from the Swaziland mission was in town and
                    we had lunch. To make what could be a longer story short, I ended up going to
                    Swaziland in the late summer of 1984.</p>
                <p>It was pretty traumatic in a way to do this. Having “grown up” in the Latin
                    America bureau, which was a pretty insular bureau to start with, and the project
                    development officer corps within LAC was even more so. I think we all kind of
                    grew up with the idea that we were the shock troops of the most innovative and
                    creative and fast moving bureau in the agency. And having been someone who had
                    risen pretty quickly in the ranks there and occupying in fact the most senior
                    project development officer position in the bureau, the position that Buster
                    Brown had occupied when I came into the bureau, it was a bit of a shock to a lot
                    of people that I would leave and go to Africa, of all places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go on to your Swaziland tour, I meant to ask you
                        earlier a little about the Latin America bureau as you saw it at that time,
                        its structure, leadership, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SMITH: As I was saying, I think there was a view by those of us in the bureau
                    that this was the lead bureau, and Buster Brown, my earliest mentor in the
                    agency, I think was the biggest cheerleader for that view and that approach. At
                    that time the Latin America bureau had the largest budget, certainly on the loan
                    side of the program, and people in the bureau really took a lot of pride in the
                    fact that we were doing some of the most innovative and creative and forward
                    looking programs in the agency.</p>
                <p>In the late '70s the bureau fell on hard times financially, or in terms of
                    resources. The Carter administration really put a lot of emphasis on the poorest
                    of the poor, most of whom were not in Latin America but in Africa and Asia, and
                    began to make resource allocations based on poverty criteria rather than other
                    criteria such as where the best development projects were, etc. So, there was a
                    falling off of resources in Latin America at that time. My own view of this is,
                    and I have said this to other people, that in the early '80s the Latin America
                    bureau sold its soul in order to regain the large quantity of resources that it
                    associated with its culture and ethic from the '60s and early '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it sell its soul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: This whole politicization of aid in the Latin America program that was
                    reflected in the Kissinger Commission and other Reagan initiatives in Central
                    America and the Caribbean in the early '80s were in exchange for regaining its
                    prominence in terms of the resources. The bureau was willing to go along with
                    some of the strings that were attached, strings which in my view were not
                    developmental strings at all. In doing this, it was willing to compromise some
                    of the development leadership that it had played in the '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Latin America bureau take on the basic human needs
                        approach that came out of the Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In some places it did, and, of course, the places I was, Bolivia and
                    Haiti, were two of the countries in Latin America where that was most
                    appropriate even if there hadn't been a basic human needs approach. But, I think
                    there were a number of people in the bureau and in the bureau leadership who
                    were perhaps more comfortable with the capital development days of the '60s and
                    and never particularly bought into the basic human needs approach, and were more
                    pleased with the turn of events in the early '80s and the private sector
                    initiatives and those kinds of things than I personally was. I was quite content
                    with the nudge that the basic human needs, new directions approach, gave to our
                    programs in Latin America. In fact, when I first came into the agency that was
                    just coming into full flower and I was pleasantly surprised because it
                    contradicted a little bit the image of AID that I had had from growing up in
                    Latin America and from studying development and international organizations and
                    US foreign policy in college. But, I guess in some ways it was that period that
                    was unique.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the shift from capital projects to
                        the sector program which was an innovation that the Latin America bureau
                        talked about a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To some extent. We did some of those programs both in Bolivia and
                    Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of that kind of approach as opposed to
                        the capital projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To tell you the truth I am not sure I can really untangle that from some
                    of the later history that I recall from my experience in AID. The few sector
                    programs that I remember having been more closely involved with were largely
                    just a packaging of individual activities. In relation to your question, with
                    its comparison with capital projects, capital assistance, it is also hard to
                    disentangle that from the basic human needs, new directions approach because I
                    think a lot of the sector programs I was familiar with were a combination of
                    ways to address a series of activities or projects that were more basic human
                    needs oriented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These weren't balance of payments assistance programs,
                        they were focused on a sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were not. There were some programs in the '60s and late '70s in
                    places like Colombia, where there were sector programs, and some called sector
                    programs in Brazil that by the time I came into the agency had been approved and
                    were under way. Mostly, what I got involved in with those programs was more the
                    programming of the local currency resources than the balance of payment
                    side.</p>
                <p>We will come to a new iteration of that as we get further down the road, because
                    there is a variation or application of that in Zimbabwe which I think was
                    excellent. But, I don't really recall having a lot of involvement with the
                    sector programs in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view technical assistance institutional
                        development and contrast that to capital development in the Latin America
                        bureau? A lot of capital project officers seemed to have a different view of
                        the technical assistance function. Was this a major concern in building up
                        institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SMITH: What comes to mind as the concern, frankly, is a bureaucratic issue that
                    up to 1973 or 1974, the program documentation for those two kinds of programs
                    were different. The grants of the technical assistance program followed a
                    certain documentation path and the loan projects followed a different one. There
                    were different responsibilities, at least from the two generalists backstops
                    within the agency. The grants in the technical assistance programs were largely
                    backstopped by the program offices, whereas the loans were the domain of the
                    loan officers or capital development officers who later became project
                    development officers when the two systems were combined. In the early years,
                    when I was just starting, this was one of the issues that came up a lot in
                    reviewing programs. There were some tussles and struggles over who had what say
                    over these kinds of programs. Then the documentation was combined and in Latin
                    America, at least—and this was different from Africa as I came to find—because
                    the dominant programs were the capital projects and the “elite” corps were the
                    loan officers, what happened is the capital loan officer began to take over
                    responsibility for projects which combined both capital and technical
                    assistance. So in the early period when I was first in Washington and then in
                    Bolivia, in particular, where a substantial portion of our program was loans,
                    but were projects which combined into one project loan and grant assistance,
                    these were something that the project development officer took responsibility
                    for.</p>
                <p>Because I came into the agency when those two were being put together,
                    organizationally, I guess I don't have any of the historical perspective of when
                    they were separate, so I have always thought of capital and technical
                    assistance, even in the mid '70s when we were working with these programs, as
                    complementary parts of the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you see technical assistance as an important part of
                        the capital assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. Virtually all of the programs that we reviewed in the Latin
                    America bureau in 1975-76, and all the programs that we designed in Bolivia in
                    1977-78, combined technical assistance and some grant assistance with capital
                    assistance. So, it was always viewed as an integral part of the package, an
                    essential part of carrying out the program. Now, having said that, I am not
                    sure, looking back on that through the haze of 20 some years or so, that we
                    always necessarily looked at those as a way of building institutional capacity
                    to sustain the efforts that we were supporting through the loans. More likely is
                    the fact that the technical assistance was regarded as something that was
                    important to help implement those projects, but without necessarily taking a
                    longer-term institutional capacity development perspective. That, of course,
                    later has become a much more significant feature in things. But, it was always
                    an integrated part of the program in virtually everything that we supported and
                    financed, even the housing guarantee programs which were a different kind of
                    financing but which still had a technical assistance grant element, not only for
                    technical assistance contracts but also training and other grant funded
                    activities. The grants were a significant and integrated portion in programs at
                    that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>In Haiti, that was much less the case because we didn't do any loans in Haiti.
                    Haiti was on the list of least developed countries and was eligible, even when
                    AID had loans, for all grant financing of capital projects. Then, ultimately, we
                    provided most of our assistance in Haiti to private voluntary organizations,
                    which traditionally have received grant funds. So, the distinction between loans
                    and grants didn't exist in the Haitian program. But, again, even when we were
                    carrying out funding programs like a credit program, rural road program, etc.
                    there was an integration of capital assistance for equipment and construction
                    and credit funds with technical assistance to go with it. So, it has always been
                    in my AID experience an integrated package.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other question about Latin America and then we will go
                        on to Swaziland. The Latin America bureau was rather unique in having this
                        back to back integration with the State Department. How did you view that
                        from your perspective in LAC/DR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Actually the integration literally existed at the level of the country
                    desks and so the Central America desk for State Department and the Central
                    America desk for AID were literally the same one. The director might be a State
                    Department person and the deputy an AID person. I can't remember when that
                    actually stopped being the case. I think it was probably about the time I came
                    in in the mid '70s. But, in any event, in other offices of AID in the region,
                    the DR and DP offices, there always was a separation because there wasn't a
                    counterpart office in the State Department. It is interesting that it was after
                    the literal separation of the AID and State offices in the early '80s when, in
                    many ways, the combination was actually stronger than it had been earlier
                    because of the highly politicized programs in Central America and the Caribbean.
                    AID, I think, was much more an instrument of American foreign policy and, in
                    that respect, integrated with the State Department in Latin America in the early
                    '80s after the physical separation had occurred than it had been in the '70s
                    when AID was pursuing the new directions mandate that the State Department folks
                    weren't really interested in and didn't see much value in. So, in some ways the
                    integration was closer than after the physical integration ended.</p>
                <p>Other perspectives I have on it were from my father who worked on a desk in the
                    late '60s in the Latin America bureau, after we came back from Brazil. But, I
                    don't have any personal recollection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go on to Swaziland now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Change of region and assignment in Swaziland asprogram/project development
                    officer - 1984</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SMITH: I have a couple of overview comments first, if I may. Moving to the Africa
                    bureau was a shock to me in a couple of ways, although without reservation it
                    was a positive shock. I had grown up in my career in a certain system with a
                    certain esprit de corps and succeeded in that system, and then I rejected it to
                    go off to someplace else. Within the Latin America bureau, frankly, in the '70s
                    and early '80s, Africa was kind of the lowest place around. That was not the
                    place any self respecting person would go. So, I had this image of having
                    separated from a certain part of the family, and this can lead to a questioning
                    your own motives: did you do the right thing? and all of that. So, at one level
                    there were issues about what kind of mistake I was making in doing this. But, at
                    a different level I felt very good with that decision, because I really did have
                    growing differences of view with priorities and the kind of programs that AID
                    was undertaking in Latin America. And looking back, it was not unlike my
                    breaking the mold and successfully getting out of the Laos assignment in order
                    to go to Latin America, which in those days was doing the kinds of programs I
                    wanted to do. Well, ten years later I did the same thing, but this time out of
                    Latin America and into Africa.</p>
                <p>One of the things that has always pleased me in that regard, is that there was a
                    kind of a validation of having done the right thing and maybe providing an
                    example for other people. There were two other people, who I think very highly
                    of, who had also been very successful in their own careers and had pretty much
                    grown up in that same Latin America system, and in the next couple of years they
                    made the same kind of move away from the bureau to the Africa bureau. They are
                    Carol Peasley and Wendy Stickel. Carol, I think, is still deputy assistant
                    administrator in the Africa bureau and Wendy is the deputy director out in the
                    regional mission in southern Africa. They are people with whom I had worked very
                    closely. In fact, Carol and I sort of traded positions for a while. She had been
                    the Central America finance chief in LAC/DR before me and I came in to replace
                    her. When I left as assistant director in LAC/DR in 1984, she came in and
                    replaced me. Within a couple of years, both Carol and Wendy left Latin America
                    bureau and went to Africa, and that sort of validation is something I have
                    always taken some comfort in. I don't know if what I did was a model for them or
                    made it easier for them to do the same kind of thing, but in some ways I think
                    it might have been and that gives me some satisfaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>On a different level, going to Africa and getting out from under the stress and
                    dissonance that had been growing with my experience in Latin America was
                    refreshing, and Swaziland was an excellent place to go. There was an excellent
                    mission director, Bob Huesmann, who was very supportive and an excellent
                    manager. Perhaps more important than that, he was just an excellent person.
                    There was a fantastic group of people. A lot with young families. Our children
                    were five and eight when we went to Africa and there were similar aged children
                    there. It was an excellent family place, quiet, a small town and all those kinds
                    of things that many people would not like. But, for us, I think without
                    reservation, Swaziland was the place, the country, where we have been happiest
                    living in my career. When asked my favorite post, I guess the honors are split
                    between three places and they are the next three places, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and
                    Ecuador. But, the Swaziland contribution to that was from an all around life
                    style and living comfort, not so much material comfort but a “fitting-in” kind
                    of comfort, and a family place and good community, and gets top honors.</p>
                <p>Another general comment before going into more specific things related to the
                    Swaziland assignment, I was quite surprised to learn, despite the sort of
                    indoctrination from my ten years in Latin America, that, in fact, there were
                    innovative things going on in Africa. My own opinion very quickly became that
                    the Africa bureau, in fact, had taken (or maybe always had) a leading position
                    within the agency in doing some very creative, very innovative kinds of
                    programs. It was a different kind of place, a different kind of ethic. In Latin
                    America there were more resources, more intellectual resources in the
                    counterparts, more things that you could do, the region was more advanced in
                    terms of the possibilities for development programs. So, in a technical kind of
                    way on the development continuum perhaps you could do some more advanced things.
                    But, somewhat counterbalancing that, it was established, it was routine, the
                    countries themselves had been independent for 150 years or so, so there was no
                    real dynamism around of being a new country, quite contrary to what you found,
                    at least in the countries we were assigned, in Africa. The missions in Latin
                    America in many cases had existed for 30 or 40 years and had built up large
                    staffs of very competent local people, and while there are definitely some very
                    positive benefits to that, a consequence is that they become very routinized,
                    very structured, very bureaucratic. This didn't exist in a lot of the African
                    countries, where the missions were small because there weren't a lot of trained,
                    highly educated local professionals, or if there were, you were competing
                    directly for them with the organizations you were trying to support and to
                    build. The missions didn't have the depth of local talent, but also didn't have
                    the rigidity or the structure that sometimes exists with programs or offices
                    that have had a long history. So, I found at a program level, an innovation
                    level, and a way of doing business level, a completely refreshing dynamism in
                    the Africa bureau, which I didn't expect to find at all. I left Latin America
                    looking for and thinking I would find programs that would be more basic human
                    needs oriented, more poverty oriented. I did find that, but also a lot of
                    intellectual stimulation, a lot of creativity, a lot of flexibility that didn't
                    really exist in the Latin American region or programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>So, some general impressions of the region. I had been a person up to that point,
                    and as part of my upbringing in the Latin America bureau, someone who strongly
                    advocated against cross-regional tours. I had felt that there were advantages to
                    regional specialization, especially in terms of language, and that this idea
                    that popped up from time to time that agency officers could benefit from
                    experience in more than one region was nonsense and that one should specialize.
                    Well, it didn't take very long for me to come to a completely different view of
                    that, and I have since believed that one can learn a tremendous amount by
                    working in more than one region, and that one can get insular, can get to a
                    point of not questioning the way things are done, if you just stay in one
                    region. I have benefitted tremendously from the move to Africa. I was able to
                    bring to the Africa program some of the perspective and experience that we had
                    had in Latin America, but I think much more importantly as it turned out, when I
                    went back to Latin America, to Ecuador, a few years later, I was able to bring
                    to Latin America a new way of thinking about things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Such as creative approaches to project design. It is interesting to say
                    that because, again, in Latin America we had taken pride in being creative
                    project designers. I found that not to be the case. We will get into this in
                    Swaziland and in Zimbabwe, where I think we were doing some really fantastic
                    things that in Latin America nobody thought of. This was also true with the
                    whole question of staffing, of doing more with less, a term which was just
                    beginning to be widely used in those days. For a variety of reasons, the African
                    programs were achieving that in a way the Latin American ones were not. There
                    were a lot of opportunities, I think, for looking critically and constructively
                    at the way we were staffed and the way we approached projects and our
                    responsibilities in Latin America that usually by force of necessity in Africa
                    just weren't possible. But, we will come back to that in more detail when we
                    talk about the Zimbabwe to Ecuador move.</p>
                <p>My Swaziland experience was good, not only because of the programs that we were
                    doing there, but because of what was going on around us. Swaziland, as most
                    listeners or readers will know, is a little country that gained its independence
                    in the '60s but was dominated by South Africa, in fact surrounded on three sides
                    by South Africa (on the fourth side is Mozambique), so was something of an
                    island of tranquility in this apartheid-dominated world which was very much on
                    the front burner in the mid-'80s. A lot of the assistance effort there—ours and
                    the European countries and other donors in Swaziland—was mostly because it was
                    not South Africa, and the same was true of Lesotho, and Botswana and several of
                    the other countries. Swaziland had a population of about a million people. It
                    was not a large or significant country. By African standards it was reasonably
                    well off. It didn't have any major structural constraints to development. It had
                    a resource situation that was fairly good. But, it received a lot of assistance
                    on a per capita basis because of its physical location and the statements
                    countries could make about apartheid by having an active assistance program in
                    Swaziland.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We did some interesting programs in Swaziland and I will come back to that, but I
                    want to introduce a couple of other things. In those days, 1984-85, we were just
                    beginning to open up a direct AID program in South Africa. Of course, until the
                    early '90s that was all exclusively with private organizations. We had been
                    doing a few small programs out of Washington, but in 1984 we created the first
                    AID representative office in Pretoria and that was the start of the South Africa
                    program. Swaziland earlier in the '60s and '70s had been a regional mission.
                    There was still some hold over of the notion that Swaziland could or should
                    serve in a regional capacity for countries in the southern part of Africa, and
                    so some of the early support for the South Africa program came from the
                    Swaziland mission. That same is true of Mozambique. In 1984, Mozambique had
                    disavowed its communist past, joined the World Bank and the IMF, and began to
                    receive for the first time US assistance, mostly an ESF program, a large PL 480
                    Title I food donations and a couple of projects as well. In 1985, we established
                    the first AID representative office in Mozambique. That program, too, was
                    supported out of Swaziland. So, it is interesting to think now, again with ten
                    years of hindsight, that the seeds for the programs and missions which would
                    become two of our largest, if not the two largest, programs in Africa—Mozambique
                    and South Africa—were planted in 1984-85 during the time we were in Swaziland.
                    The mission in Swaziland was a support mission for those programs and gave me an
                    opportunity, in both cases, although more in Mozambique than in South Africa, to
                    go on TDYs and to help begin to structure the initial programs in both of those
                    places.</p>
                <p>The Mozambique experience was probably most interesting because it was the first
                    time in a long time that I had used any Portuguese, and having grown up in
                    Brazil, I had the language but hadn't used it at all in over 17 years. The
                    Mozambique experience gave me an opportunity to tap some of that and to use it
                    again. Of course, the Mozambique program was literally quite similar to the
                    programs that were underway in Central America that I had a lot of experience
                    with, but the difference for me was the whole dynamic, the whole motivation for
                    those programs was quite different in that Mozambique was a country that was
                    just opening up to US and Western assistance. While they had changed course with
                    their politics, there was still a real commitment there to the basic needs of
                    their inhabitants. It wasn't a revolutionary change, it wasn't an over throw of
                    a leftist government and replacement by one of a different kind, but more of a
                    gradual shift, so there was a lot of the interest there in meeting the basic
                    needs and focusing programs on poverty alleviation activities. That was, for me,
                    a much stronger motivation for the economic support and PL 480 Title I and other
                    programs than was the case in Latin America, where I felt we were actually on
                    many occasions supporting governments that did not have that sense of priority
                    for their inhabitants.</p>
                <p>And, in South Africa, there was a kind of moral satisfaction in trying to begin
                    to work with organizations that were trying to change the apartheid system. The
                    sense of being on the right side of these ideological issues was a very positive
                    and refreshing change from how I viewed our role in Latin America. So, the
                    Swaziland mission was at the hub of those two programs as they started out.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>In addition to that there was a regional program in southern Africa, which still
                    remains. That was channeling assistance through SADCC, the South African
                    Development Coordinating Council, , which was a loose organization of nine or
                    ten southern African countries, trying to band together and coordinate on their
                    development and other policies in reaction to South Africa and its economical
                    and political presence and domination in the region. We had supported since the
                    early '80s a program of assistance through SADCC that was headquartered out of
                    the AID mission in Zimbabwe. But one of the interesting things about SADCC was
                    that they had made a conscious decision not to build up a new organizational
                    superstructure above the individual country levels, and had divided up
                    responsibility for different sectors among the countries that formed the
                    organization. Swaziland was the country responsible for human resource
                    development programs within the overall umbrella of SADCC. That meant that for
                    AID's regional programs through SADCC, the agreements were actually signed with
                    the countries that took lead responsibility for those activities within SADCC,
                    and the AID missions within those countries had some oversight of those projects
                    in coordination with the regional office in Harare. The regional office at that
                    point basically had one person in addition to the director, who was the director
                    for both the bilateral program in Zimbabwe and the regional program. So, the
                    staff within AID mirrored the organizational approach of SADCC. One of the areas
                    that AID was emphasizing in its regional program was human resource development
                    and training, and those regional programs were also undertaken in Swaziland, and
                    formally signed with the Swazi government. Thus, I had an opportunity to get
                    involved in some of the design and oversight of those regional programs, because
                    of their location in Swaziland.</p>
                <p>So, while it was a small country, Swaziland had a fairly large AID program,
                    relative to the size of the country because of the political circumstances, and
                    then there were other interesting things going on in the region—South Africa and
                    Mozambique and this regional program—that really made that experience a
                    multi-dimensional one for me. It was a way for me to expand horizons and
                    experiences and, in some cases, draw on the Latin America experience,
                    particularly with respect to Mozambique.</p>
                <p>Within the Swaziland program, itself, there were two activities that stand out
                    that I was more directly involved in. One was a small grant to a private
                    voluntary organization in Swaziland's main industrial city, Manzini. It was a
                    small, church based, community development organization that had done a lot of
                    work with small business training programs. We started a relationship with them
                    that eventually resulted in a small project to help them expand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of this organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:I don't remember off hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>We developed a skills training and small lending program for small scale
                    businesses in Manzini and other places in the country as well. That was
                    interesting. It was a new program for that portfolio. I wasn't there long enough
                    to see it into implementation and to know how it played out, but from what I
                    hear, it was successful and was a channel for helping a number of businesses in
                    that area.</p>
                <p>The more significant project that I was involved in was a large, integrated
                    maternal and child health program, primary health care project. One of AID's
                    emphases in Swaziland for a number of years had been health and population. So,
                    there were a number of previous efforts to draw on, but the maternal and child
                    health programs were coming to a close and one of the tasks that we had was to
                    design a new follow on project to those activities. I don't know that this in
                    the end was particularly successful for a couple of reasons. One, and the one I
                    will talk more about, was the AID reaction to what we came up with. The second
                    was that the leadership in the health sector in Swaziland was very shallow.
                    There were two or three people who were very dynamic and with whom we saw eye to
                    eye on priorities and procedures and things, but when you have that thin a layer
                    of leadership who were trying to change things for the better, it is a very
                    fragile situation, and in fact I heard after I left there that a couple of those
                    people left their posts for one reason or another, and the program itself
                    somewhat floundered in the absence of their leadership. The project probably did
                    not have the support of the vast majority of the ministry of health because we
                    were trying to make some fairly significant changes in approach and practice.
                    Our interlocutors had been the dynamic leaders, but once they left the scene,
                    there really wasn't much leadership to give that effort direction or a
                    boost.</p>
                <p>But, the thing that I was more concerned with at the time was the project design
                    process. Again, I look back at this from the perspective of the re-engineering
                    that has occurred in AID in recent years. It has occurred to me more than once
                    that in 1985 in Swaziland, in designing that health care project, we were
                    substantially ahead of our time because what we put together there was not the
                    traditional kind of AID project which costed out all of the inputs and presented
                    in detail what they were going to produce and all of that. We started with a
                    vision of what the primary health care system in Swaziland should look like and
                    what are some goals or targets for service levels, for coverage, etc., that it
                    should be in place at the end of the project. Then we said, here are a variety
                    of activities that we think are necessary to carry out in order to accomplish
                    these goals, but we don't want to sit down at the beginning and prescribe what
                    the exact course is going to be because no one knows what it is going to be.
                    What we want to do is to provide the resources, the vision, frame of reference
                    and goals we are working for, but allow flexibility for people, the mission and
                    the ministry of health people, to select the tactics as they are needed in order
                    to reach those targets.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Well, Washington did not like this because we didn't have the ability to meet the
                    611(a), or whatever it is, regulation of making sure that our cost estimates
                    were sound, because we didn't go through a process saying that this was exactly
                    what we are going to buy and this is how much that is going to cost and
                    therefore this is what adds up to a total amount of the project. We said that
                    here is roughly the amount of money we have available and want to allocate to
                    this, or we think is necessary to accomplish these things, but we don't know
                    exactly how it is going to be spent. Here is a list of options or choices of
                    things that it may be spent on, but we can't prescribe in advance what that is
                    going to be.</p>
                <p>When we presented that idea to Washington it got bounced back because we hadn't
                    done our design work sufficiently and I think that was a tremendous setback.
                    What I was saying before about the thin layer of leadership and the fragility of
                    that probably remains the primary cause for this effort not being as successful
                    as it might have been. But, I also think the delay that was introduced in the
                    process and the artificiality of what we then had to do, which was to go back
                    and come up with the cost estimates in the traditional way, set back that effort
                    by a year and therefore didn't allow us to take advantage of the leadership
                    being there and begin to get things started and give them kind of a vote of
                    confidence and flexibility to go with this that was part of the original
                    concept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You lost momentum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be interesting here to comment about whether
                        there is a difference in the kind of leadership that is required between
                        those two different approaches that you talked about, the one that is quite
                        open and flexible and the other one which is quite blue printed and
                        precisely detailed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The difference I think would be this. With the more flexible approach, you
                    need someone who can engage his or her counterparts (talking about the AID side
                    now) in a constructive and frank but collegial partnership and dialogue. You
                    need someone who is flexible and open and really has a good relationship, but
                    not the kind of relationship that anything is okay, but someone who keeps in
                    mind what it is we are trying to accomplish together and, of course, is familiar
                    with the procurement and other kinds of regulations that exist and the strings
                    that are attached to our assistance programs. That is a requirement in that kind
                    of approach. I think that is the best way to work anyway. Even with the
                    blueprint approach, I think those programs would work better with that kind of
                    management approach, but it perhaps is not as necessary because in a sense
                    things are all designed out and it becomes more of a monitoring the process.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>But, to respond to your question about management styles. You can have a
                    different management style and still get by with the blueprint approach, whereas
                    you couldn't be successful with any other style with the other approach. Now, I
                    don't think the blueprint approach works, period. So, to me it is not a question
                    of a difference in management style. I don't think that the completely designed
                    program, except perhaps for some construction projects which mostly we don't do
                    any more, works. I think the kind of development programs that AID is involved
                    in are not ones susceptible to a lot of advance implementation planning. They
                    require flexibility, a degree of responsibility and a degree of ownership on the
                    part of the people who are tasked with implementing them that you don't
                    frequently get with a designed, turn-key type of project. In general, I don't
                    think that the approach of packaging everything in advance and saying leave the
                    implementation to somebody else works. That was, I suppose, one of the myths of
                    my Latin America project development/loan officer upbringing, because we very
                    much had the ethic in the mid and late '70s that the important part of the
                    development process was the project design and if the project was designed well,
                    it will work. I'm not sure I fully embraced that even then, but certainly from
                    the mid '80s on I think exactly the opposite, that you can take a snap shot of
                    where you are at a particular point in time—and it certainly is important to
                    look very closely at all the elements that go into a development effort and a
                    program or project and to be very honest in completing your assessment of those
                    factors—but that is all that it can be, a snap shot at that particular time.
                    What you then need to do is to give flexibility and responsibility to people to
                    keep those goals in sight and choose the tactics that work best under the
                    changing circumstances that will confront that project later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference in continuity or time frame for the
                        public leadership function, on both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, yes. I am not certain this responds to your question but let me say
                    what comes to mind. One of the issues, I think, that normally accompanies the
                    more detailed, advanced planning, concept of project design, is, at least in the
                    AID world, and I am sure this is true at the World Bank and others, that there
                    is a tremendous gap in time between all of the creative and intellectual energy
                    that goes into developing the project proposal, and the time when it is
                    approved, and agreements are signed, the technical assistance hired and
                    implementation begins. There can be a year or longer between that during which
                    any momentum that had been built up or any ownership that had been created or
                    any commitment that was there from the host country side, has largely dissipated
                    and gone, and sometimes the leadership of individuals who were involved in it
                    has also moved on. Whereas the other approach, again I suppose it depends on
                    where you choose that punctuation mark or where you take that snapshot in the
                    process, is much more of a continuous process. There will always be a period of
                    time between whenever AID or any other organization says, okay let's wrap this
                    up into a proposal for approval and we then have to sign an agreement. I will
                    talk more about this in reference to my time in Ecuador where we tried to get
                    the AID approval of the project at an early enough stage so that the details of
                    implementation planning could be done as the first step in implementation, not
                    at the last step in the design. Not that we did this in the health care program
                    in Swaziland, but it was the kind of program that was more susceptible to that
                    than the traditional AID project.</p>
                <p>If there is one single criterion or determinant in the success of development
                    efforts (and there are many), that one would be the commitment on the part of
                    the host country people who are your partners and who are carrying out that
                    effort to what it is you are trying to do together. If you don't have that at
                    the beginning, then the chances of succeeding are much less. A lot of people say
                    that we will give them the money and that will buy their support, or we will
                    work on that as part of the technical assistance effort. But, you need to have
                    that at the beginning. Not that it can't succeed otherwise, but I think that is
                    one of the major determinants of project or program success. You are always
                    susceptible to how deep that commitment is. Is it the vision and commitment of
                    one leader, even if it is the minister of whatever, or in this case in
                    Swaziland, the minister of health and deputy minister? Both were high ranking
                    people and in a position to make some broad institutional changes in the
                    structure of the ministry, but one needs to be aware of the possible fleeting
                    nature of that and to look to some extent below that and persuade people that
                    what you are trying to do is something that is in their interest, and not really
                    start it until there is a fairly good notion that they agree with that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The project eventually went forward. We didn't end up staying in Swaziland
                    very long, in fact, we were there only 16 months. So, during the time I was
                    there what we did was the initial attempt at the project paper that was rejected
                    by Washington and by the time I left Swaziland in January, 1986, we were still
                    working on the revised project paper to meet the Washington requirements. So, I
                    didn't really see the project into implementation.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other projects of note?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There were other programs that were going on. We had a large population
                    program and we had a manpower development project which provided skills
                    training, a lot of which was provided as scholarships or funds for participant
                    training for Swazis to go to universities in the US. The mission did some
                    interesting work there in forming an alumni society of returned participants and
                    trainees that met at least once a year. It was a vehicle for us to stay in touch
                    with people whose training we had helped to fund and who, of course, were
                    expected to be influential in the development of the country. It gave us an
                    institutional vehicle for doing that that I think was quite innovative. Other
                    places in southern Africa were doing the same kind of thing.That was one of the
                    areas which contrasted a lot with experience in Latin America. For example, in
                    Latin America we financed a lot of participant training but didn't have any kind
                    of vehicle for staying in touch with people, unless they happened to be working
                    with our projects. So, here on a country level was an organizational structure
                    through which AID could stay in touch with them. We also, I think, in that
                    program provided some funding for people to buy books or computers or other
                    things that would help them take advantage of their training when they came back
                    into jobs in Swaziland. I think those were interesting and innovative aspects of
                    what in my previous life had been pretty cut and dried and boring. Here there
                    was an attempt to try to make participant training into a real development
                    effort. In Latin America, most programs were training three people from this
                    project or whatever, while in Swaziland this was a training program that took in
                    the entire country with an application and screening process. There was a focus
                    on getting a good cross section of people from different sectors, backgrounds
                    and more of a view to how to have a long term impact on the development of the
                    country, not just carrying out the implementation of a project that you happen
                    to be financing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the Swazi culture which you
                        were trying to bring development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Swazi culture was very conservative. There were a lot of stereotypes that
                    I had about Africa that were broken in these years, even though we had earlier
                    traveled to Ethiopia and a few other countries in Africa in 1973. One was
                    captured in a photograph that I took of snow on the hills of Lesotho during a
                    vacation we took there. To see snow in Africa was not something that I expected
                    ever to see.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Swaziland was a real interesting mixture of traditional and modern cultures. It
                    is a kingdom. The head of state is a king. During the time we were there they
                    were between kings, King Sobhuza had died and a young son of his had been named
                    as heir, but he was out of the country in school, so there was a regency in
                    place which made for a little bit of instability at the political level. The
                    traditional leadership structure of the king, princes and village chiefs was a
                    lot more than window dressing. It was an integral part of the political dynamics
                    of the country. But, by the same token, there was a modern, Western dimension to
                    the government as well. Swaziland, being sort of nestled into South Africa, had
                    a lot of business ties with South Africa, which definitely brought a number of
                    modern influences with them. So, there was an interesting mixture of the two.
                    Swazi society and culture were quite conservative, particularly with respect to
                    women, their role and dress. In that respect, even though one associates a lot
                    of Latin American countries being fairly conservative in terms of women's roles
                    and rights, this was even more so.</p>
                <p>The traditional Swazi culture was largely pastoral, largely dependent on corn
                    production and cattle, and the environment was very conducive to that. Some of
                    the poverty indicators, particularly with respect to education and health were
                    pretty high, but living was not bad. There were not large slums. There were not
                    homeless people. Basically, the geography and climate could sustain people at a
                    fairly decent, if primitive, standard of living without much problem. As a
                    result, there was not much dynamism for radical change to become more modern.
                    So, part of the conservatism was cultural conservatism, but part of it too was
                    that things were not so bad there. There was no real rush to become more modern.
                    It was a kind of tug and pull between modern and traditional. There were large
                    amounts of foreign assistance flowing into the country and the government could
                    play one donor off against another. If one donor was insisting on a change to
                    help create a better environment for development, there might be another one
                    waiting out in the hall who is going to be less insistent.</p>
                <p>When I went to Mozambique a couple of times, the contrast with Swaziland couldn't
                    have been greater. The people and government of Mozambique were just coming out
                    of a long period, ten years, of an inward oriented, isolated socialist,
                    communist rule and a guerrilla war, which didn't end for some time after that.
                    However, the openness to the West, an enthusiasm for doing things, for making a
                    change in Mozambique was a tremendous contrast to Swaziland where things were
                    quite comfortable and quite nice, and don't rock the boat too much. So, while we
                    did some interesting things in Swaziland and it was a very pleasant place to
                    live and to work, the environment was not a dynamic and alive one from a
                    development standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a population project. Was that something
                        well accepted there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was reasonably well accepted. Again, within the context of a fairly
                    conservative culture. Mostly it was a program carried out by a private
                    organization program, focused on women and integrated to some extent in the
                    primary health programs. It had been reasonably successful. There was the kind
                    of opposition that you would expect from many traditional leaders. There was
                    more attention given to traditional methods of contraception and not necessarily
                    the modern methods. The program certainly provided pills and condoms and other
                    modern methods, but also looked very creatively at how traditional methods of
                    birth spacing and family planning could be used as well. It was a major and
                    active program that we had, but one that had certain constraints on how far it
                    could go. However, I think in the general scope of things it was reasonably
                    successful.</p>
                <p>Before I went to Swaziland, I had learned that the deputy director position there
                    was going to be vacant. In fact, I may have mentioned that the person who had
                    been the deputy director in the mission in Swaziland, Jimmy Philpot, went over
                    in mid to late 1984 to be the first AID rep in Pretoria. So, that position was
                    open. One of the things that I thought about in making this turn in my career
                    from Latin America to Africa was that, in terms of level in the organization,
                    the combined program/project development office job in Swaziland was at best a
                    lateral move, and may have even been a step backward on the career ladder for
                    me. But, when I learned that the deputy director position in Swaziland was going
                    to be open and I was already selected to go there as the program/project
                    development officer, I talked a couple of times to the mission director, Bob
                    Huesmann, to find out if there was any possibility of me being considered to be
                    deputy director there as well. In the end, it did not work out. I said, “Fine,”
                    and it was not a condition of my going there that I be considered for it. But
                    once I had thrown my hat in to that ring, part of the process in being
                    considered for the deputy director position in Swaziland was to go through what
                    at that point was called the EPAP (executive placement) process, the process for
                    screening and selecting the senior officers. Before I left Washington in 1984 I
                    had made the rounds of people in Personnel who were responsible for executive
                    assignments and had gotten my name thrown into the process. But, then when the
                    job didn't come through, I went happily to Swaziland and didn't think any more
                    about it.</p>
                <p>But, one consequence of having thrown my hat in the ring was that I began,
                    virtually upon arrival in Swaziland, to get calls about whether I was interested
                    in other deputy director positions around Africa. I was successful in saying no
                    to those, for a variety of reasons, for a while. First, because we had just
                    gotten there and it was a very enjoyable place and we enjoyed the people we were
                    witI hadn't especially been looking for a senior assignment, just going through
                    the EPAP process in case there was a chance of being considered for the deputy
                    job in Swaziland.</p>
                <p>But, the calls kept coming, and one of them was about the deputy director
                    position in Zambia. I talked about this with Bob Huesmann, and we agreed that it
                    would be a good move for me to make. However, I didn't want to move until the
                    end of the year, 1985, but they needed a replacement for the deputy director in
                    Zambia that summer. So, that didn't work out.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>When I was in the States for a short visit during the summer of 1985, I talked to
                    a few people in Washington about a variety of positions, again in an exploratory
                    way, and had learned that the deputy director position in Zimbabwe was open or
                    going to be open. John Hicks had been in that position and had left to go to
                    Malawi as director. I sort of said that if Zimbabwe was a possibility I would be
                    interested. I had been to Harare once or twice on some of the regional programs
                    that I mentioned earlier and had fallen in love with the place instantly. So, I
                    kind of threw my hat into the ring there.</p>
                <p>Well, in September at the regional planning meeting for eastern/southern Africa
                    that was held each year in Nairobi, Roy Stacy, the director in Harare,
                    approached me and said he had been talking to Washington and basically—and this
                    was the first time I had known of it—I was on a very short list of candidates to
                    come there as deputy director and what remained was for us to talk. So we did
                    that. To make a long story short, in January, 1986, we moved to Harare, where I
                    became the deputy mission director for the bilateral program.</p>
                <p>Move to USAID/Zimbabwe as deputy mission director in 1986</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that the mission in Harare had responsibility for both the
                    bilateral program in Zimbabwe as well as the SADCC regional program. Up to that
                    point, the regional program had basically been handled by Roy as the director
                    and Dale Pfeiffer, who was the regional development officer. But, in 1985 it
                    looked like the SADCC program had become more established—I think about $50
                    million a year was earmarked in appropriation legislation for the regional
                    program—so the mission in Zimbabwe was reorganized to create two deputy
                    directors, one for the regional program and one for the bilateral program, with
                    still one director and separate regional and bilateral staffs. So the regional
                    program would have a deputy director and staff that corresponded to the programs
                    which they had, which were largely construction and engineering, whereas the
                    bilateral program was more agriculture, human resources and training, so had a
                    program officer, an agricultural and human resources staff. I went there to
                    oversee the bilateral program.</p>
                <p>While Swaziland was the country we enjoyed living in the most, Zimbabwe is and
                    remains my favorite country, which is actually saying something because I grew
                    up and liked Bolivia, and we also enjoyed Ecuador quite a bit, but Zimbabwe
                    stands apart from that; it was a case all its own. There were the physical
                    attributes, just the natural beauty and the wildlife, etc., which we very much
                    got involved in and enjoyed during our time in southern Africa, and especially
                    Zimbabwe. But the other thing that made it stand apart was that I felt we had
                    the most appropriate, innovative and best AID program that I saw in my career.
                    In large measure, that was what motivated my interests in going there in the
                    first place and to have an opportunity to be associated with that program was a
                    great opportunity.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Zimbabwe became independent in 1980 following 15 years of war after Rhodesia
                    issued its “Unilateral Declaration of Independence” from Britain. In 1980-81,
                    with the coming of the Reagan administration, there were not a lot of funds for
                    staff or for expensive programs in Africa. The “more with less” theme was being
                    sounded, as I mentioned before. Both the portfolio of projects and the structure
                    of the mission in Zimbabwe were designed from the outset to be streamlined and
                    to economize on the staff needed to implement it. I have thought a lot about
                    this, and don't really know how much of the success or nature of that program
                    was due to the fact that Zimbabwe had, as a legacy of both the British colonial
                    period and 15 years as Rhodesia in the UDI period, very well established, public
                    administration structures and procedures and generally very well trained
                    government employees. In that respect, it was much more like Latin America than
                    probably any place else in Africa, in terms of the quality and capabilities of
                    the public administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to that, following Zimbabwe's independence there was a huge return of
                    people, Zimbabweans who had been living in Europe or North America, who made a
                    personal commitment, sometimes at great costs to themselves and their careers,
                    to come back to their country and try to make independence work. To try to
                    realize the ideals of independence and the struggles that many people had fought
                    and died for. So, there was a dynamic there, an enthusiasm, a commitment of
                    people, many of whom had come there at substantial cost to themselves to try to
                    make things work.</p>
                <p>And, the priorities that the government had were the priorities that AID had in
                    terms of agricultural development, health care, education and the basic human
                    needs efforts. To a unique extent, I think, in my experience, there was a
                    coincidence of views on the development priorities and development programs and
                    development approaches at that time. Those factors allowed the design of a
                    program which was substantial in size. The commitments that were made as part of
                    the Zimbabwe independence negotiations and agreements were for $75 million a
                    year for three years, a package of $225 million over the early years of 1980s.
                    Substantial resources, on a par with what was happening in most of the Latin
                    American countries. And yet, the programs were designed as a combination of
                    non-project and project assistance in a way that allowed flexibility to respond
                    to local circumstances when they came up.</p>
                <p>The key programs were a commodity import program that provided machinery and
                    capital equipment that was very much needed by Zimbabwe because of restrictions
                    that had been in place throughout the Rhodesia period and were still in place
                    because foreign exchange was rationed and controlled. There was an agricultural
                    sector program, a human resources or education sector program, and a family
                    planning programing. Those were the four key programs through which this $75
                    million a year was channeled.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Both of the sector programs had a combination of non-project and project
                    assistance. There was a large CIP (commodity import program) portion, which
                    generated local currencies. In the agriculture program, the CIP was limited to
                    commodities for the agricultural sector. The “project” portion funded technical
                    assistance that which was available to complement the local currency
                    generations. Project funds also financed some commodity purchases that were
                    directly related to program activities.</p>
                <p>The agricultural program, I think, was the most interesting, but was similar to
                    the other ones as well. There was a coordinating committee chaired by the
                    ministry of finance, on which the ministry of agriculture and a whole range of
                    government agencies that were involved in the agricultural sector were
                    represented. AID was involved as an observer, a participant but not a full
                    voting member. There was a $45 million program, $30 million of which was the
                    commodity import program that generated local currencies, and $15 million was
                    for technical assistance and other dollar costs. Those resources, in effect,
                    were all put on the table and government agencies, mostly, but some private ones
                    as well, could put together proposals for the use of those funds. These
                    proposals had to be designed to achieve goals that were set within the context
                    of the program for the whole sector. So, the design of the program identified, I
                    don't remember exactly how many, but let's say five different areas, different
                    subsectors, or outcomes or goals, that the program had, that were Zimbabwean
                    goals as well as our own. A process was designed for agencies to propose
                    individual project activities that would make progress towards those goals or be
                    in those sectors. This committee then reviewed the proposals and allocated the
                    resources to them based on whether they needed local currency or dollars or a
                    combination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the over all goal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The focus was on agricultural development and within that, as I recall, to
                    develop commercial agriculture by African farmers, to diversify crop production,
                    to expand the research and extension activities in agriculture aimed at African
                    farmers. The vast majority of commercial agricultural output in Zimbabwe was,
                    and I think still is, produced by a relative handful, about 100,000, white
                    commercial farmers—maybe not even that many. Of course, the vast majority of the
                    population historically had been disenfranchised and put on the least productive
                    land. So the real focus of the program was to try to expand agricultural
                    opportunities to the majority of farmers in the country. The Commercial Farmers
                    Union, the white farmers union, and other groups were also partners in that
                    process. So, there was a real attempt to try to bring into the process the
                    experience and resources of the white commercial farmers as well. Our focus was
                    on improving research and extension, crop diversification, commercial crop
                    production, training programs at the university.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The vehicle for the grant funds, the technical assistance funds, was a large
                    contract with Michigan State University, but it wasn't the traditional project
                    with a contract that funded a team of advisors that was identified from the
                    beginning. The contract was more of a mechanism that was put into place to allow
                    Zimbabwe to access US expertise as it related to the support of its program.</p>
                <p>That was essentially the structure of the agricultural program, a $45 million
                    project. There were a couple of other smaller, more traditional projects in the
                    agriculture sector, but this was the principal one. Because of the way the
                    program was set up, the leadership and direction of the program came from the
                    Zimbabwean government and involved all organizations, public and private, in the
                    sector in defining and approving activities, a combination of local and dollar
                    funds managed very flexibly and openly. Our agriculture staff in Zimbabwe—which
                    was three people, one US direct hire, one Zimbabwean professional and one
                    secretary—were able to manage a portfolio well in excess of $50 million because
                    of the way the program was set up.</p>
                <p>The human resources program and the CIP were set up in a similar way. The CIP,
                    itself, generated local currency which was programmed through a similar but
                    different group in the ministry of finance. The education program was a little
                    different, but basically was a similar structure. It had some non-project funds,
                    some project funds. They were programmed through a process like the one for the
                    agriculture program. There was a substantial training component to the project.
                    That whole program was managed by one direct hire and one Zimbabwean
                    professional and one secretary/administrative assistant who handled a lot of the
                    paperwork for the participant training program. There was a large technical
                    assistance contract for that program as well, which was with the Academy for
                    Educational Development. In addition to being the channel for all technical
                    assistance and direct dollar costs for education programs, this contract was
                    actually the vehicle for implementing all of the overseas training activities
                    financed by the entire portfolio.</p>
                <p>The family planning was then, and remains, one of the most successful family
                    planning programs in Africa, if not the world. It had the personal attention of
                    and was led by the sister-in-law of President Mugabe, who gave it very dynamic
                    leadership. The program was very innovative in reaching a lot of rural people,
                    combining both traditional and modern methods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a fair amount of technical support from REDSO
                        didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SMITH: We had some, a lot of which was in the project design and in the legal and
                    contracting areas. But the staff of the bilateral program in Zimbabwe was, if
                    you include the director and the deputy director, eight US direct hires and a
                    similar number of Zimbabwean professionals and a small support staff. The entire
                    staff of the mission, including the regional program, was 45 people, for a
                    program that was in size equivalent to the one in Ecuador, where the staff was
                    135. That was 45 people for both the bilateral and regional program. There was
                    some support from REDSO, but the day-to-day technical support was managed by
                    that mission because from the outset it was designed to be a “more with less”
                    kind of program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the key considerations that made that
                        possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as I mentioned before, I think a lot of the public administration's
                    capacity and the integrity of the systems that existed in Zimbabwe account for
                    that. And, I think too, that the coincidence of interests, the commitment to do
                    the kind of things that we typically try to promote, was by and large there.
                    There were policy dialogue issues, but nowhere that I had been before or since
                    was there the notion of a true partnership, an equal relationship, between AID
                    and a recipient country as I felt in Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>Actually that was not always comfortable because you kind of get used to saying,
                    “Well, if I am paying for this then I can call the shots and have my way.” There
                    was a very memorable deputy or assistant secretary of education who was usually
                    a thorn in our side, but I think was motivated by a real concern, a real
                    commitment to doing the kinds of things that we agreed on doing, but had an
                    anti-American or anti-Western edge to him. He was very clear on a number of
                    occasions that just because we were giving the money or providing it on a grant
                    basis, that didn't mean that we could decide or direct them how to use it. And I
                    think that is right. So often AID is able to use its position as the grantor to
                    get people, at least on the surface, to do things that they may not be persuaded
                    are the right things to do. What this did in Zimbabwe was make us have to
                    persuade them of our point of view intellectually, so they were committed to it;
                    we were not about to say to them to do something because we are bankrolling it.
                    That was a different role and a more difficult role in some cases, but I think
                    it was the right role and the only role to be successful in these kinds of
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the program have, in the context of today's interests
                        in results, very specific benchmarks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SMITH: No. In terms of today's world they probably would not have measured up in
                    terms of the degree of specificity of the goals, strategic objectives of those
                    kinds of things. But they were in that direction, and, again, like the health
                    project in Swaziland, I think they were precursors of the kinds of programs that
                    AID is looking at today. If you look at the concept of the re-engineered AID
                    system, the absence of projects an instead programs built around strategic
                    objectives, in the language of the early to mid '80s, that is what those
                    programs in Zimbabwe were. They were sector programs—they identified a number of
                    constraints, identified a number of areas of focus—that began to identify some
                    sort of proto-goals, not in specific terms, but provided the structure around
                    which individual tactics and activities could be chosen, in this case by a group
                    of people headed by the ministry of finance and involving a variety of
                    organizations from the sector to program and to use those resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could you be sure that all of these components and
                        different interests added up to something that was going to achieve what you
                        are trying to accomplish as opposed to a sort of political process with
                        everybody getting a piece of the action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, that was a concern. We did do some evaluations of the program. I
                    think because we were in the middle of the implementation of the program, they
                    focused more on how the activities were going. The question you raise is a valid
                    one of “what does it all add up to?” I didn't have the sense that there was a
                    mentality of “I'll approve your project if you approve mine and we will allocate
                    this and make everybody happy.” I think it was a serious effort. Activities were
                    turned down and I think the review process focused on the merits of an activity.
                    That doesn't respond to the concern about how do you know that this all adds up
                    to something. Was there a large strategic vision behind this and people went out
                    looking for pieces to fill in gaps from things that just naturally surfaced?
                    There wasn't that. Not that there couldn't have been, but I don't have the sense
                    that there was, but then that wasn't really the spirit of the times, anyway.
                    This was, I think, several years ahead of its time in terms of what AID was
                    doing elsewhere. But, it wouldn't be fair to say that in the early and mid '80s
                    in Zimbabwe, AID was already carrying out exactly the kinds of programs that
                    were envisioned by the re-engineering of the mid '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the proof is in the results regardless. What were the
                        results of these programs? Were they being effective? Did they achieve the
                        broad goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, the programs, themselves, were very effective. In these kinds of
                    programs, one is often measuring their success by national level changes and
                    impact. Certainly in terms of those kinds of indicators the agricultural sector
                    and the education sector, and especially the family planning program, were very
                    successful in the early and mid '80s in Zimbabwe.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>What contributions could be attributed to the monies and the roles that we
                    played? I think that is a different question. The activities, themselves, sort
                    of anecdotally, seemed to be by and large quite successful in achieving the
                    objectives that they set up, and the overall macro trends in terms of
                    agriculture production, the increases in agricultural production by African
                    farmers, the number of people enrolled in universities were positive. But those
                    were things that the government was emphasizing across the board, so it is
                    really hard to isolate what the impact of our resources was on that, except that
                    we were part of that effort and supportive of that effort and that effort was
                    being very successful.</p>
                <p>That is the positive side and this part of my Zimbabwe experience stands as the
                    best and highest point of my AID career and, in some respects, my life. But,
                    there was a negative side, and it came to take over. As I've said, there was a
                    tremendous coincidence of views that the US and AID had with the Zimbabwe
                    government on development issues, and we had an excellent and constructive
                    relationship with the government. In addition, the government of Zimbabwe
                    pursued very pragmatic policies on economic issues, particularly via-a-vis its
                    dependence on South Africa, This was not at all predictable, given the fact that
                    they had just won their independence after 15 years of war with a regime similar
                    to the one that was in South Africa, But they took a very pragmatic approach to
                    their situation. They didn't expropriate all the white businesses and farms and
                    didn't kick everybody out, but were constructive about trying to build a new
                    nation that took advantage of those people, incorporated those people.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Zimbabwe's foreign policy was at right angles to ours. These
                    were the days of “constructive engagement”, when the Reagan administration was
                    trying to take a more engaged approach with South Africa and pursue that as a
                    way of resolving the apartheid situation. That was perceived in Zimbabwe as
                    being very much in favor of apartheid, because we were not condemning it and if
                    you are dealing with the South Africans then you are not with us.</p>
                <p>I personally feel, and this is not necessarily the result of any profound
                    political analysis, that Mugabe and the government had come to power after a
                    long revolutionary war with a lot of expectations and a lot of promises to
                    people that things were going to be different. They weren't really that
                    different. They were taking a very pragmatic approach in terms of economics and
                    that sort of things, were not ex-appropriating the rich commercial farms and
                    handing them out in small parcels to Zimbabwean African farmers. However, they
                    needed an outlet rhetorically for their leftist ideology and for their promises
                    and the expectations that had been raised in the people, and that was their
                    foreign policy position. So, in the United Nations and in speeches and those
                    kinds of things, they were vehemently and very outspokenly anti-American, even
                    to the extent of being one of the two countries that voted with the Russians
                    against the United Nations resolution that condemned the shooting down of the
                    Korean airliner by the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>But, my view was that this essentially was harmless in terms of our interests
                    because what was happening on the ground was very positive. It was not only that
                    our program itself was a success, but the kinds of things that we were
                    advocating in terms of development programs and economic pragmatism were what
                    they were doing. But the State Department didn't quite see it that way, and in
                    those days it liked to get its way and liked people to say that they liked us
                    and appreciated us. So, by the time I got to Zimbabwe in January, 1986, there
                    already had been a real roller coaster relationship for several years. Probably
                    only because of the commitments that Jimmy Carter had made at the Lancaster
                    House negotiations leading to Zimbabwe's independence was the whole $225 million
                    actually provided, because if it had not been protected by that I think the
                    funds would have been cut back. But, by the time I got to Zimbabwe it was at the
                    end of that, the commitment having been already made, and we were a little more
                    vulnerable to funding scrutiny. But, more importantly, there was this real
                    love/hate relationship between Zimbabwe and the United States. When it came to
                    speeches at the UN and other kinds of things, then everybody in the embassy and
                    the State Department would go ballistic and start threatening to cut the AID
                    program and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things we did and that I got involved in was how to
                    orchestrate some good public relations, how to set up circumstances where we
                    could get government ministers to say nice things about the United States that
                    would then get printed in the newspaper and could then get put into a cable back
                    to Washington saying, “Look, here are some nice things they have said about us.”
                    Probably the most ridiculous extreme of that that I recall involved the very
                    good housing guarantee program there (I forgot to mention it earlier), a part of
                    which was that we purchased a couple of trucks for the housing ministry. They
                    arrived and we had a ceremony to turnover the keys to these two new trucks to
                    the ministry of housing. We orchestrated an event to which the minister or
                    deputy minister of housing came to receive the trucks from AID. There were a
                    series of speeches where the minister was scripted to say nice things about all
                    the collaboration Zimbabwe and the United States have had. Then, that was put
                    into the newspapers and we sent it back in a cable to Washington. After events
                    like this, things would get better for a while, but then there would be a speech
                    made at the UN or somewhere else and relations would nose dive.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>As all of this was going on, Roy Stacy departed in May, 1986, to come back to
                    Washington as, I think, an assistant secretary of State. This was only four
                    months after I arrived in Zimbabwe. His successor, Allison Herrick, wasn't
                    scheduled to get there until August. At the same time, Dale Pfeiffer, who had
                    been in Zimbabwe for four years although he had just become deputy director for
                    the regional program, left to become deputy director in India, and his
                    replacement also was not expected to arrive until August. So, from May until
                    August, not only was I the deputy director for the bilateral program, I became
                    the acting deputy director for the regional program and the acting mission
                    director, because there weren't that many people there. The regional staff had
                    just begun building up. In fact, they had five positions on the organizational
                    chart, but only one or two of those people were actually there, so I got to wear
                    that hat as well. So, it was kind of a busy summer. When I went to Zimbabwe in
                    January, this was the first senior management job I had had, and by May I was
                    the acting mission director and acting regional director as well.</p>
                <p>That would have been okay. I didn't necessarily enjoy this political back and
                    forth process (and this is where the politics of foreign aid were again
                    beginning to rear its head in my career), but I think we were being creative in
                    dealing with that, as I was saying with the turning over of the trucks' keys and
                    those kinds of things, but trying to respond to that and trying to get in front
                    of people in Washington some of the successes that we were having, trying to
                    reinforce the view that there was a partnership here, that we see eye to eye on
                    these things and there is more to it than the surface reaction to these kind of
                    crazy foreign policy speeches. And, we were moderately successful along that zig
                    zag path.</p>
                <p>But, on the Fourth of July, Jimmy Carter happened to be in Harare on a private
                    visit having to do, I think, with his work with Habitat for Humanity. Since he
                    was viewed as having been a key figure in Zimbabwe's independence given his
                    support for the Lancaster House process and agreements, he was a fairly revered
                    person in Zimbabwe and a very popular ex-president. It was really just
                    coincidental that he was there on the Fourth of July. The embassy invited him to
                    the traditional Fourth of July mid-day events. It had been agreed, because this
                    was during another time of difficulties in terms of the foreign policy speech
                    making, between the embassy and the government that there wouldn't be long
                    speeches. The Zimbabwean government representative would say a few nice things
                    and particularly welcome President Carter, and then the charg� d'affaires (we
                    were also without an ambassador at the time), would say a few things and
                    President Carter would say a few things. All together that would be may be ten
                    minutes and then we would go on with the toasts and cut the cake and that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>So, the charg�, Gib Lanpher, who ten years later became ambassador to Zimbabwe,
                    did his little part and Jimmy Carter did his little speech saying nice things
                    about Zimbabwe and the AID program and those kinds of things, and then the
                    government representative started to talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the government representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SMITH:It was the minister of youth, sport and culture. He probably had been setup
                    for this, I think. I'm not even sure he knew what he was going to say because
                    certainly the speech was not about youth, sport and culture. The first few
                    minutes of the speech were aimed at Great Britain and its policy vis-a-vis South
                    Africa, which under the Thatcher government was similar policy to ours, and, of
                    course, Britain being the original colonial power in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe easily
                    came in for special criticism, even ahead of the United States. I first thought
                    this was going to be an astute political, sort of between the lines thing, and
                    that some parallels were going to be drawn—and they were—between the fact that
                    both the United States and Zimbabwe had gained their independence from Britain,
                    what we stood for and all those kinds of things. But, after a little bit of
                    ranting and raving about British policy towards South Africa, the speech slipped
                    into the familiar refrain of criticizing the US and the double standards and how
                    could we do this, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all written text?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, it was, he was reading it. That went on for about 20 minutes and I
                    don't really remember at what egregious point in the speech that the charg� and
                    President Carter walked out in the middle of the speech. And with them went
                    two-thirds of the room, including most of the rest of the diplomatic corps and
                    other official representatives. I don't even think the minister of youth, sport
                    and culture knew what was happening until he looked up from the paper and saw
                    his audience had disappeared. But, with President Carter being there there was a
                    lot of press around covering this and instantly it was beamed around the world,
                    and the BBC and the Voice of America reported that this speech had been made and
                    that the charg� and President Carter had walked out in protest over this and
                    hadn't even cut the cake at the Fourth of July party. In fact, by the time I got
                    home a couple of hours later, on the BBC was the news that this had happened in
                    Harare.</p>
                <p>That night the AID program to Zimbabwe was suspended indefinitely. As it turned
                    out it was suspended for about three years, but at the time it was an indefinite
                    suspension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you consulted at that time that that was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was advised that that was going to be the recommendation of the embassy
                    and I tried to argue, obviously ineffectively, that staying engaged was a better
                    way to influence the government than cutting off relationships. I made all of
                    the arguments that I could muster. I was out of my league at that point. I
                    couldn't think of anything I could do to change that and probably there was
                    nothing that could have been to change that particular outcome. The program was
                    indeed frozen, suspended.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was all activities or only new commitments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was only new commitments, although we fought for a while over what was
                    already in the pipeline, because we had actually signed in the month or two
                    prior to that a substantial amount of money. There was a time when there was
                    serious consideration being given in Washington, I understood, to deobligating
                    those funds. I took the position that if they did that then I would resign and
                    someone else would have to come and take away unilaterally money that was signed
                    in agreements in good faith. I don't know if I would have resigned, but it
                    didn't happen so I didn't have to make that final decision. The pipeline was
                    allowed to remain, but any new agreements were gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any new agreements pending?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:Yes, we probably had obligated about half of our funds for that year at
                    that point. Because of the roller coaster situation we had some clear sailing
                    days in which we quickly readied some things to sign and had done what we could
                    to do the groundwork for those in terms of congressional notifications and those
                    kinds of things, but not everything was in that situation. About half of the
                    program, which may have been $20-30 million of funds that were envisioned for
                    that year, were not signed at that point.</p>
                <p>The exception to that was the population program and because it was viewed as a
                    very successful program, we were able to work out an arrangement with the
                    population office in Washington to fund that program centrally through one of
                    the international population PVOs, who then in turn would make the funds
                    available to the Zimbabwe family planning program, but not through a bilateral
                    agreement. So, that program was able to survive the suspension through that
                    detour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that your idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I participated in that, but I don't know that I can claim ownership.
                    It was something we came up with—the program officer, who was Lucretia Taylor,
                    who is now director some place in Africa, and Duff Gillespie, who was then and
                    still is the head of the population office in Washington. The agriculture sector
                    program, the human resources program, the CIP, those programs were gone, at
                    least the funding for them was gone. The regional program remained, in fact
                    remained a major program for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we talk about the regional program, do you have any
                        insight, understanding, of what was behind this action of the Zimbabwe
                        government and who was the one who promoted this effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I have none. I am sure there was no understanding of the implications. In
                    the immediate aftermath there was this whole big thing about apologizing because
                    the speech had been really, literally, insulting, even to President Carter. So,
                    there was this sort of tug and pull between Robert Mugabe and Ronald Reagan,
                    with Mugabe saying, “I will apologize to Carter because he is a decent person
                    and someone we respect, but I don't have anything to apologize to Ronald Reagan
                    for.” I don't think it was intentional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a Mugabe initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think so. I think it was that the foreign ministry and a couple of
                    other ministries were sort of the radical wing of the party and the ones that
                    were instigating these kinds of speeches in the UN and other places. It wasn't
                    any different from that and I think they just saw one more opportunity to do
                    another “in your face” kind of thing. I don't know that it was a calculated
                    campaign. I certainly don't think that there was any weighing of the possible
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think by responding the way we did that we played
                        into their hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. It was among one of the more ridiculous and childish things
                    that I have seen happen in my career. It was really the epitome of “we will take
                    our marbles and go home if you don't say nice things about us.” The speech was
                    not diplomatic and not an appropriate thing to do, but it had nothing to do with
                    our relationship with Zimbabwe on the ground and their development programs and
                    our cooperation with them. And it had no impact on anything that mattered, in my
                    view. Yet it was an extremely childish and arrogant attitude on our part to say,
                    “If this is all of the appreciation you can give us, then too bad,” without
                    looking below the surface at the that actions were being taken, not just the
                    words that were being spoken, in our joint efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any affect on our policy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, except for the AID program. It wasn't only the AID program, I think
                    that had an effect on our ability to engage a whole range of influential people
                    in the government in areas where we had been partners and colleagues—agriculture
                    and education, and labor and finance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It made it much more difficult for us to keep up a relationship with them
                    and for us to have an influence on their programs and activities, because the
                    medium for that relationship was cut off. The only thing that we had to talk to
                    them about any more was how to close down some of the programs, instead of how
                    to continue to help support what they were trying to do. It was totally
                    shortsighted in terms of any longer term interests in the development of the
                    country or our interest in the country in anything else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. It had no effect on what happened in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or our policy towards South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. It took another ten years and some very special circumstances down
                    there to evolve. This remains the darkest moment of my life really, not just my
                    career, but my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were going to talk about the regional program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was only going to say that the bilateral program, although stopped short
                    in its tracks, had a certain pipeline and in some cases was able to fund
                    activities for another couple of years, but on a phasing down level, and the
                    family planning program was kind of rescued and saved. However, the regional
                    program was definitely on the way up. Funding continued to be earmarked in
                    appropriations legislation for SADCC. The regional side of the mission was just
                    getting staffed that summer. The new regional deputy director had been selected.
                    A new mission director had been selected. After the suspension, there was some
                    question as to whether she would come or not, but since the regional program was
                    in Zimbabwe, they decided she should come. But, what happened was the dynamics
                    in terms of what dominated the time and attention of the mission shifted from
                    the bilateral program to the regional program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Zimbabwe included in the regional program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. In fact, Zimbabwe was the lead country on the food security and a
                    couple of others things and continued to get funds through the regional program
                    for those regional efforts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which we didn't provide through bilateral programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SMITH: Right. And, of course, the regional office continued to remain there, even
                    while the bilateral program was closing down.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, the staff of the two sides of the mission were highly
                    complementary. The regional program had the engineering and the project
                    development staff, the bilateral program had agriculture and human resources and
                    the program office. So, after Allison Herrick got there, and after Pamela Hussey
                    got there (she was the new deputy for the regional program), and after it looked
                    like the suspension was going to last a while, we had a number of discussions of
                    how to address the problem from a staffing standpoint. Again sole authorship is
                    not relevant here, but I will take credit for the initiative of the idea of
                    basically combining the two staffs into one, in a more traditional mission
                    fashion, by having the formerly bilateral agricultural and human resources
                    office take care of those issues on the regional side and having the project
                    development office and engineering take care of whatever residual issues there
                    were having to do with the bilateral program. It meshed together quite well, so
                    that it would give some more forward looking things for the bilateral staff to
                    be working on related to the regional program, and also would allow sufficient
                    coverage for the remaining activities under the bilateral program.</p>
                <p>But, there was one area where that combination wouldn't work: it didn't make
                    sense to have two deputy directors. One of the things that I had done in
                    addition, or as part of, the deputy director role for the bilateral program was
                    to handle all of the administrative responsibilities in the mission. We did not
                    have an AID direct hire administrative officer. We participated in a joint
                    administrative office in the embassy for most of the time, although one of the
                    things we did was to separate from that while I was there. I handled as deputy
                    director a lot of the traditional administrative officer functions and had a
                    couple of people working with me in that role. As time passed and as Allison and
                    Pamela came, and as we began to put the mission together, more and more what I
                    ended up doing was the administrative role. A little bit of that was okay, in
                    fact one of the attractions for me in coming to Harare in the first place had
                    been to get that kind of exposure, the operation of a mission program, but it
                    became more and more of what I did and that was not the turn I had envisioned my
                    career taking. I wasn't that interested in the regional program, although there
                    may have been theoretically a point in time where I could have said maybe I
                    would stay there as regional deputy and Pamela wouldn't come, but I wasn't that
                    interested and didn't want to do that anyway to her.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>So, by the last part of 1986, I felt increasingly marginal to what was going on
                    there. Not that relations were bad at all within the mission, but there was just
                    less and less for me to do. I began to make phone calls around to different
                    people, first to the African bureau, as to what positions might be available. By
                    that point in the game, the fall of 1986, there weren't that many, because for
                    most of the deputy director positions elsewhere in Africa candidates were
                    already identified and there wasn't much that was available. So, drawing on the
                    contacts I had had in my Latin America days, particularly ones related to the
                    work I did on staffing issues for project development officers, I got back in
                    touch with the Latin America bureau and the management office there, as well as,
                    indirectly, with Buster Brown, who at that point was deputy or acting assistant
                    administrator for Latin America. Out of those discussions I learned that there
                    was going to be an opening for a deputy director in Ecuador. After several calls
                    back and forth, in December I was offered that position and agreed that I would
                    finish out my tour in Zimbabwe in the summer and then go to Quito at the end of
                    the summer.</p>
                <p>Return to Latin America bureau and assignment in USAID/Ecuador - 1986</p>
                <p>That was the plan. But in the meantime there were a couple of earthquakes, one
                    literal and one figurative, in Ecuador. The literal one was an earthquake which
                    occurred in February, 1987 or early March, which caused extensive damage. It
                    ruptured the main oil pipeline from the eastern part of the country over the
                    mountains to the ocean and thus cut off a significant portion of Ecuador's
                    foreign exchange earnings for what turned out to be about six months time. That
                    put them in tremendous economic hardship as well as causing considerable damage
                    to several communities in eastern Ecuador. So, there was a lot of new assistance
                    being programmed for Ecuador, to provide both immediate and longer term relief
                    from the consequences of the earthquake.</p>
                <p>Coinciding with that was a management or personnel “earthquake” in the Ecuador
                    mission. When Frank Almaguer went to Quito in August, 1986 as the new mission
                    director, he discovered a number of activities and practices that had occurred
                    in the mission which caused him great concern. As a result, he requested a
                    number of investigations and audits by the inspector general's office and the
                    net effect of that was that several people, including my predecessor as deputy
                    director, had their tours shortened and were asked to leave on extremely short
                    notice. Five separate audit reports were written with a total of twenty or
                    thirty recommendations for improved internal management operations, ranging from
                    finance to contracting to administration of local currency programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the core of the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The core of the issue was some very questionable practices having to do
                    with local currency management and having to do with financial management and
                    the Controller's office operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Subsidizing a couple of salaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, among other things, it involved salary supplements. It involved
                    literally how the funds were accounted for. There were cases of bank accounts
                    into which local currency was deposited on which AID employees were signatories.
                    There were alleged cases of cash in brown paper bags. There were alleged cases
                    of improper and just no accounting of funds. There were cases of contracting
                    irregularities with personal services contractors given responsibilities not
                    appropriate for contractors. A range of things.</p>
                <p>But, as I said, several key people, including the deputy director, left quickly
                    and under a cloud. As a result, and particularly with the real earthquake coming
                    on top of that, I got a call in March to ask whether we could possibly come to
                    Quito sooner, before the summer, get established and then take home leave, and
                    not wait until August to get there. We did that, and literally left Zimbabwe on
                    about three weeks notice.</p>
                <p>So, we went back to Latin America. That hadn't been my game plan. But, we went
                    and Ecuador rounded out my trio of favorite places. Ecuador proved to be the
                    high mark of my career. It wasn't the place that we enjoyed living most,
                    although it was close. It wasn't my favorite country. The program was good but
                    it wasn't like the Zimbabwe program. But, all around and in terms of my career,
                    in terms of the mission and the things we were able to do, the relationship I
                    had with Frank as his deputy, it is the high water mark. There is no question
                    about that in my mind.</p>
                <p>The initial two or three months we were there were spent on damage control of
                    both kinds. The week I arrived was when the IG gave their briefing on their
                    draft reports. The assistant administrator for Latin America, Dwight Ink, who
                    had worked very closely with Frank on this, had sent his own special
                    representative, Fred Fischer, down to look into the situation. He left a report
                    that had something like 43 or 44 recommended steps to deal with the management
                    problems in the mission. Most of what I did for the first two or three months,
                    actually for the first year I was there, was to oversee the implementation of
                    the steps we took to respond to the IG reports and Fred Fischer's list of 44
                    recommendations. That was what really consumed the first year that I was
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Ecuador is an extremely fascinating country. I don't have any problems with
                    Bolivia or Haiti—we have enjoyed all of the places we have lived—but Swaziland,
                    Zimbabwe and Ecuador were an excellent run of countries. Ecuador continued to be
                    a place that we really enjoyed working in, as was true of Africa as well. Our
                    children were of an age where we could get out and travel some. I think all of
                    us had really been bitten by the wildlife and environmental bug in southern
                    Africa, and Ecuador was a perfect place in which to travel because of the
                    tremendous biological, and geological diversity that exists in Ecuador—from the
                    Amazon basin in the east to the Galapagos Islands out in the Pacific, to the
                    highest active volcano in the world, and everything in between. It was just a
                    fantastic setting to work in.</p>
                <p>Despite my earlier comments about the size of the staff, which was about three
                    times the staff I had left in Harare for a program that was about the same, it
                    was an excellent staff, one of those Latin America staffs with a lot of very
                    good local talent.</p>
                <p>During my first year in Ecuador, in addition to dealing with the management
                    recommendations, I also spent a lot of time with some heavy duty recruiting for
                    U.S. direct-hire staff, replacing people who had left and filling vacant
                    positions. Of course, the AID system being what it was and even with the
                    attention of the assistant administrator, we didn't always get high priority on
                    these kinds of things. But, we were able to rebuild the mission staff over that
                    first year and in the end had an excellent group of people. It was really a
                    delightful environment to work in.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of traveling, a lot of getting out into rural areas, the Amazon and
                    the mountains. One of the reasons I went back to Latin America was not to go
                    back to Latin America per se, but to go to Ecuador. Ecuador was, I felt—and I
                    proved to be correct, I think—one of the few countries in Latin America where
                    there really wasn't a big US foreign policy agenda. There wasn't an overriding
                    interest beyond the development program that would skew or adversely influence
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why were we there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SMITH: Because of development. What I mean by that is the countries to the south,
                    Peru and Bolivia, had the drug problem, and Colombia had the drug problem as
                    well. Central America in 1987 was still an area of major conflict, and there
                    were other issues in the Caribbean. Haiti by that time had eclipsed and gone
                    into night. Ecuador, I think, was the only place in Latin America that had a
                    program of significant size and yet really wasn't dominated by one of those
                    political interests. Now, what accounted for its significant size, in addition
                    to its development needs, was the fact that the president of Ecuador from
                    1984-88 was Leon Febres Cordero, who was a populist but conservative leader from
                    the coastal Guayaquil area who was a great fan of Ronald Reagan. Ecuador
                    returned to a democratic government in 1979 and the first president was Jaime
                    Roldos, who died in a plane crash while he was president. He was then succeeded
                    by his vice president, Oswaldo Hurtado. Both of them were of somewhat leftist
                    leaning and clashed philosophically with the Reagan administration. But Febres
                    Cordero came in after that representing a pendulum swing in Ecuadorian
                    politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through a fair election process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. He was very much a fan of Reagan and the free market rhetoric, if not
                    practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have a personal relationship with Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think there was one, but not a significant one. There were a couple of
                    visits during that period by Vice President Bush. There was a real cozy
                    relationship. Ecuador was viewed as a kind of ideological soul mate of the
                    Reagan administration in South America, which embraced the private sector and
                    began to carry out am export-oriented structural adjustment program. That, then
                    resulted in a real increase in the amount of assistance that Ecuador got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What scale are we talking about now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: $50-70 million dollars a year, compared to $20-30 million which had been
                    the level before then, and the level we returned to not too long after. There
                    wasn't a US foreign policy interest other than supporting Febres Cordero and the
                    kind of policies he stood for. There wasn't a drug issue, there wasn't a civil
                    war. There was enough interest to give a significant level of resources, but
                    with little interference, so we were basically able to carry out a program that
                    made sense on the ground without others putting on strings or overruling what we
                    wanted to do. In that respect, for me it was an ideal situation of which there
                    are not very many in the world, then or now.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>We enjoyed that situation most of the time I was there. Not that there weren't
                    some potholes in the road. In fact, Febres Cordero turned out not to live up so
                    well to his rhetoric and to spend most of the last year of his administration
                    under a cloud of corruption. If you look at a chart of the assistance levels to
                    Ecuador during the '80s there would be fairly low levels in the early '80s, a
                    jump up to a height of $60-70 million a year in the mid '80s and then back down
                    again to $20-30 by the end of the decade. That vast increase in resource levels
                    in the mid-'80s, by the way, and the imperatives to do something with it
                    quickly, I think is not unrelated to the management problems that I mentioned
                    before. In the hurry to get things done, the hurry to be responsive and the sort
                    of free-wheeling kind of environment that that sort of foreign policy blessing
                    and all those additional resources gave, I think made people a little more
                    susceptible to cutting corners or to abuses in the interest of trying to get
                    things done more quickly and in a fairly short term and short sighted kind of
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a large portion of that related to the
                        earthquake?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. That was all afterwards. The earthquake was in 1987. Febres Cordero
                    came in in 1984, so it was the 1984-86 period when all of this was built up.</p>
                <p>Another factor was that during that period, Ecuador had a political appointee as
                    mission director. This was very rare in those days. But, Ecuador in the early
                    '80s had been kind of a sleepy place, and this was frankly true of some of the
                    American staff that were there too. It wasn't on the cutting edge and it wasn't
                    typically first drawer people who were there. The Reagan administration had this
                    retired Air Force General from Puerto Rico that they wanted to put someplace and
                    Ecuador seemed the most harmless place to do that. Well, circumstances changed,
                    but the staffing wasn't changed to reflect that. So, from all reports, you had a
                    very detached, arms length political mission director who wasn't of AID, didn't
                    know the procedures, had much more of a business mentality and got caught up in
                    a lot of the relationships with Febres Cordero and his cronies.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had tremendous resources, ESF funds, PL 480 Title I funds, Section 416
                    food program funds, so there was a whole diversity of local currency and dollar
                    funds. We had housing guarantees. It was a broad and diverse program. We had a
                    very active policy dialogue, particularly in the Borja government after 1988, on
                    some of the economic policy changes that we were working with the government on
                    through the ESF and PL 480 Title I programs.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of things that stand out for me in Ecuador. I have hinted at one
                    and will mention it again very quickly— the excellent relationship I had with
                    the director, Frank Almaguer. As the deputy, one of the things that is always
                    kind of a question mark is what your role is going to be and how well you get
                    along with the director. I had an extremely positive, complementary, mutually
                    reinforcing relationship and Frank was and remains on the top of my “heroes
                    list” in AID and a mentor and a person I highly respect and look up to. We
                    worked well together instantly. I didn't know Frank when I went there. I had met
                    him a couple of times in the hallways, but our career paths were different up to
                    that point. I knew a lot of people who were directors in Latin America in those
                    days, but Frank was not one of them, so there was a bit of a question mark
                    there. But, it instantly worked and probably was the best work relationship that
                    I have had in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from having to implement the inspector general and
                        other recommendations, what was your role in the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: My roles in the program were several. Over the course of the time we were
                    there, we went through a gradual, but in the end fairly radical, refocusing of
                    our programs. The programs from the mid-'80s had been sort of a
                    let-a-thousand-blossoms-bloom kind of approach, so there were a variety of small
                    grants, many with very institutionally immature private voluntary organizations.
                    A lot of them were private business associations, chambers of commerce or
                    private enterprise association of XYZ, and the grants were to carry out little
                    programs in training or promotion or a similar activity. This created a
                    portfolio that had horrendous management implications. One of the
                    responsibilities I had was to oversee the internal operations of the program. As
                    part of that, I played a fairly significant role in a series of what we called
                    at that time “strategic planning” activities. They were not quite what has come
                    to be known in the agency as strategic planning, although I think they were
                    pretty much the precursors of what happened in AID later. In fact, Ecuador was a
                    model for AID's performance monitoring system that evolved in the early '90s,
                    and some of the concepts that formed the basis for AID's reengineering built on
                    the foundation that we created there in the late eighties. We undertook a
                    process of looking closely to see what was working and what wasn't and what our
                    role was in the process. Again, part of that mid-'80s period was characterized
                    by an approach that maximized AID's involvement and control of things. So, for
                    example, we would have projects where the technical assistance team was a series
                    of PSCs, instead of a contract team that had its own internal structure, which
                    from one standpoint gave AID more control of what those people did, since they
                    all reported to the mission, but got us involved in all the contracting process
                    and having to amend contracts frequently, and supervising a lot of people, so
                    that our ability to have a substantive engagement with the Ecuadorians was less
                    because we were spending all of our time dealing with PSCs and contract
                    amendments, and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Administrative minutiae.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. So, we gave a lot of thought to how we could shift out of that mode
                    of operation to one where we could spend quality time with the Ecuadorians on
                    the program and not spend all our time with all the internal paperwork. This is
                    where the Zimbabwe experience came in handy. It gave me a point of reference for
                    how we could consciously design our programs to minimize the paperwork, and with
                    that maybe give up a little control, but in exchange free up our time for the
                    substantive engagement which was our comparative advantage. The reason we were
                    there in the country was not to write PIO/Ts, but to be there and engage people,
                    to provide that policy dialogue, that persuasion, that interactive process that
                    would make the program successful, not to perform administrative functions. So,
                    there was that whole set of things that I was involved in.</p>
                <p>Part of this was a series of management skills training programs. I lobbied to
                    get the regional management skills training course held in Quito. By doing that
                    we were able to have ten people from the mission in the course itself, and then
                    we got the trainers to stay a week or two extra to do additional training
                    specific to the mission. Nine months or so later, we had the trainers come back
                    and do a couple of weeks more of internal training and team building and that
                    kind of activity. These training programs were, in part, aimed at rebuilding the
                    mission after the disastrous events of the mid-'80s. But in addition, we used
                    training to focus on how to build and give substantive roles to local staff, how
                    to define your strategic direction, how to build team work and work across
                    division and office structure lines. I personally feel that many of the concepts
                    that inform and are embraced by the re-engineered AID we were trying and working
                    with in Ecuador in the late '80s. Again, there is nothing in AID that one person
                    solely is responsible for, but I think everyone there would say that I was a
                    principal stimulus for that sort of approach we took and that whole process
                    throughout the three years that we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the program evolve from all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I'm going to get to that. There was one area of the program that I took
                    particular interest in and I will come back to that in a bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I am going to use the example of the agriculture program as illustrative of the
                    kind of thing that we were trying to do in the program. And, again, these ideas
                    really were not much mine at all, although they were ones that fit very nicely
                    into the overall approach. As I said earlier, in my view successful development
                    programs need to be based on the commitment and the dedication of the people you
                    are working with. That doesn't come from conditionality and project agreements.
                    It comes from them being persuaded that a different course of action is an
                    appropriate course of action to take. It is in their interest, they see the
                    reasons for doing it, they support it for very clear reasons. Where that doesn't
                    exist, and it didn't in many areas in Ecuador, I think the appropriate approach
                    is to engage people in a process of analysis and discussion until they are
                    convinced, and then follow that with the funds for carrying out activities. That
                    is basically what happened in Ecuador.</p>
                <p>We had the ability to create, with all the local currency resources we had there,
                    a couple of private foundations in the agricultural area, one of which became
                    kind of a think tank and was the institutional home for a large three-year
                    sector assessment of agriculture that we funded and carried out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You created a foundation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. It was created through the AID programs. It was an Ecuadorian
                    organization with Ecuadorian staff, but the initial funding and eventually an
                    endowment for the foundation was through an AID program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was AID part of the management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Not officially, but we were unofficially engaged and had some influence on
                    the direction of things, but it really was an Ecuadorian initiative. The funding
                    for that, the impetus for that, grew out of our agriculture sector program.</p>
                <p>That private foundation, particularly linking it up with the institutional home
                    for the agricultural sector assessment, provided a forum that was not AID, not
                    the US government nor the Ecuadorian government, for bringing together different
                    thoughtful people and different viewpoints in Ecuador around a policy and other
                    reform agenda. It was a very successful forum for trying to institutionalize,
                    trying to build awareness. To a large degree, this created local ownership of a
                    lot of the initiatives that then followed, some of which was funded through the
                    agricultural sector program.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The program in Ecuador, largely out of frustration with dealing with the
                    government, particularly in agriculture but in other sectors as well, emphasized
                    very strongly private organizations. This foundation that I mentioned was one
                    example of a new private organization that was created. A new foundation for
                    agricultural research and education was also created and was a major new
                    initiative and the recipient of major grants that we made at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were bypassing the government because the
                        government....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They weren't literally bypassing the government because the funds were
                    channeled through the government in many cases, certainly all the local
                    currencies going to them were government local currencies. But, in the case of
                    the larger agricultural research foundation, in the end the grant was made
                    directly to the foundation, not to the government. The origins were really from
                    the Febres Cordero period, which was very pro private sector, so there was a lot
                    of openness to consider private sector alternatives. In fact, a lot of business
                    people that came in with Febres Cordero to the ministry of agriculture and other
                    places were frustrated themselves with the entrenched bureaucracy and thought
                    the only solution was creating parallel structures outside the government to
                    carry on these initiatives. Well, that creates its own problem and dynamics, and
                    a lot of what we worked on was how to bring those two together. You would never
                    really get to the point in Ecuador where the ministry of agriculture as an
                    institution was agreeing that funds should be channeled through a private
                    foundation. But it was possible to develop at least some understanding of the
                    role that a private foundation could have, some view of a constructive
                    relationship that they could have with them, that, in fact, the foundation could
                    allow them to do some things that they were unable to do on their own.</p>
                <p>The other aspect of the agriculture program was the promotion of non-traditional
                    exports. We had a couple of old, traditional rediscount lines in the banking
                    system with a not particularly effective technical assistance effort through a
                    producers association. But, over time that got re-energized and redirected and
                    refocused and became a fairly successful program promoting the export from
                    Ecuador products like roses and certain fruits and vegetables off season in the
                    US. The growth in non-traditional exports from Ecuador was tremendous, in part
                    because of the program that we had there. So, we had a twin focus in our
                    agricultural program of non-traditional exports and of policy dialogue, policy
                    analysis, policy reform, coupled with the creation of and support for a number
                    of significant private foundations who could bring a certain capacity and
                    perspective to the sector and help to move it more towards an outward oriented
                    economic and policy framework.</p>
                <p>The health program there was also probably as comprehensive as any in Latin
                    America. We had a major maternal and child health program that was quite
                    successful. We had a major family planning program, which worked with the
                    government but primarily was through a couple of private organizations. We had a
                    major malaria control program. Malaria was a problem in the lowlands of the
                    country. It was a major and rather traditional malaria eradication program.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>We had a rural water and sanitation program that mainly financed installing small
                    systems in rural communities. If I was to be philosophical about it and say what
                    did it all add up to, it would not be a lot in terms of confronting the problems
                    at a national level. But it was one of those grants that actually financed the
                    construction of small village, small community rural water systems. Throughout
                    my time in Ecuador, it was one of my favorite projects and one of my favorite
                    things to do was to go to the inauguration of the water systems. It gave me a
                    real opportunity to literally get far off the beaten track and back up some
                    mountain valley into an isolated community and to get a little sense of what it
                    is like there and how people lived there. It would obviously be somewhat
                    artificial with the inauguration and festivities, but it was kind of the
                    fly-on-the-wall or dropping-out-of-space kind of phenomenon into some of these
                    places, and it helped to get a much better sense of peoples' lives and living
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were these water systems kept and maintained? Often
                        these are started off very nicely but deteriorate very rapidly for one
                        reason or another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, that is an issue that was being addressed by the program but not
                    something that was a major focus of what we were doing because it was still
                    pretty much the construction phase. But, organizationally and institutionally,
                    the program was set up to build in an effective and ongoing maintenance and
                    fund-raising capability. There was a local committee tasked with collecting
                    water fees to help pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the system. The
                    systems usually had a pump, although a lot of them were gravity-fed. In any
                    event, we minimized the high technology side of things and focused on more
                    appropriate technologies. So it involved a combination of building, promoting,
                    strengthening a local water committee, of having fees that were generated to
                    help cover maintenance costs and looking at the construction of the systems from
                    an appropriate technology standpoint. I don't know how things actually worked in
                    practice. How many of the systems would still be functioning if you went back to
                    those places five or ten years later, I don't know, but conceptually there was
                    attention given to maintenance in those programs.</p>
                <p>The Ecuador program also had a variety of little programs that were managed by
                    the human resources and general development office, a little administration of
                    justice program, a drug education program, various attempts, all magnificently
                    unsuccessful, at civil service reform and public administration training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they unsuccessful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was just no real commitment to follow through on them. Occasionally
                    you would get a motivated and dynamic new assistant secretary for this or that
                    who would come in with lots of ideas and within three or six months would get
                    worn down by the bureaucracy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The bureaucracy was pretty difficulty there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Those programs really went nowhere. Part of the program from the mid
                    '80s was an improved tax administration program, a big technical assistance
                    contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the bureaucracy so difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, Ecuador is kind of that way. Ecuador has a difficult, entrenched,
                    public sector mentality, all of the bad things that are often said about the US
                    government but then magnified about ten times. There were a lot of people who
                    had their job security and were protective of their turf and not particularly
                    interested in any changes in the way things had been done for the last twenty
                    years. Subsidies and incentive structures in Ecuador, with the oil money from
                    the '70s and '80s, were very much focused on urban middle class, most of whom
                    were government employees. People had their lifetime jobs and didn't want to do
                    anything that they thought would threaten that. They were pretty much opposed to
                    reduction in subsidies that, for example, would increase gasoline prices.</p>
                <p>We focused our efforts to strengthen government organizations by working with
                    ministries that were either more open to change or essential for provision of
                    services, for example, the ministry of health and the primary health care
                    programs. But where the government bureaucracy was more of an obstacle than not,
                    we tried to look for alternatives, both as channels for getting things done and
                    also as a way of kind of stimulating those within the civil service, within the
                    public sector, who wanted to do some things differently and look for ways of
                    partnering between private organizations and them. So, we did not turn our back
                    on the government and go off and put all our eggs in the private sector
                    organization basket, but we kept trying to bring the public sector people in.
                    Trying to keep working on the reform agendas in those areas where we had a
                    significant involvement. That was true in agriculture and in health. It was not
                    really true in the part of the ministry of finance that dealt with tax
                    collection. It was not true with the Ecuadorian equivalent of the civil service
                    commission. Our involvement there was pretty anecdotal and we weren't in a
                    position to make a major effort there, so those things were eventually phased
                    out and the program focused more on the key areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the ones in agriculture and health what you would
                        call integrated strategies with clearly defined goals or were they a
                        collection of activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SMITH: In health it was a collection of activities with a fairly integrated
                    strategy. The approach was through three or four major projects but the
                    management of those projects was informed by a vision of sector development and
                    our involvement in the sector. So, they weren't isolated as separate units but
                    they were integrated both in terms of our own management as well as the
                    counterparts that we had. So, they were informed by a sector strategy, but the
                    tactics, the instruments, the tools, were individual projects.</p>
                <p>To some extent that was true in agriculture as well. There was an agricultural
                    sector program that was the vehicle for our funding to the private foundations I
                    described, as well as other things. Throughout that program we gradually focused
                    more on policy issues and agricultural research. In the latter, our emphasis was
                    on involving the private sector, while trying to involve at the field level and
                    at the ministry level the relevant people in the government. That approach was
                    informed by a vision. I don't know how articulate it was at the beginning, but
                    certainly the product of the agricultural sector assessment was a strategic
                    focus on policy issues and ways to involve the private sector. The way the
                    assessment was done helped it become an Ecuadorian agricultural sector
                    assessment, not just something we did as a basis for justifying AID programming
                    in the country. The overall assessment was followed by a companion assessment in
                    the natural resource area, which just got started as I was leaving Ecuador.</p>
                <p>Our assistance in non-traditional exports were channeled through a couple of
                    projects, but also drew on and was reinforced by the policy agenda and policy
                    analysis work. This typically involved a series of actors, not just the
                    government.</p>
                <p>The area that I got involved in most, personally, was environment and natural
                    resources. We had had a forestry project which was more a village woodlots and
                    public sector forest management efforts, not an environment program per se. It
                    had been on the books for a while by the time we arrived in Ecuador. The mission
                    had also funded a couple of smallish programs that helped the Nature Foundation
                    (Fundacion Natura) carry out a number of programs, primarily on environmental
                    education. But, in the late '80s, environmental issues were coming very much to
                    the forefront. The whole question of biological diversity was capturing a lot of
                    attention, the cutting down of the rain forests and all that sort of thing.
                    Ecuador is at the intersection of all kinds of neat things from a biological
                    diversity standpoint. In fact, in an analysis of the world's “hot spots” where
                    there is the most biological diversity and where it is under the greatest
                    threat, I think three of the eight or ten areas in the world are in Ecuador.
                    Ecuador has the Andes mountains in the middle of the country, and to the east
                    are the head waters of the Amazon. On the western slope, the mountains come down
                    to a broad coastal plain. On both sides there is a drop from peaks of 20,000
                    feet down to close to sea level in very little distance, which creates a wide
                    variety of micro climates that support tremendous biological diversity. In
                    addition, Ecuador has rich coastal resources and, of course, the Galapagos
                    Islands. It is a tremendous place for biological diversity and is a country of
                    great environmental richness and importance.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>We got into this actually to some extent because part of the reconstruction
                    effort after the earthquake in 1987 was in the eastern part of the country, the
                    Amazon area. We helped finance the opening of a new road to replace an old road
                    that had been cut off by landslides resulting from the earthquake. One of the
                    issues that came up there was colonization and opening up the rain forest for
                    spontaneous colonization for people who could now get in to previously
                    inaccessible areas. So, we began to get involved in some of those issues. There
                    were also big issues involving oil exploration in the Amazon region. Most of
                    Ecuador's oil is on the eastern side of the Andes. Conoco was doing some oil
                    exploration out in the middle of a huge national park in the tropical forest in
                    eastern Ecuador. They were trying to be conscientious about environmental
                    issues. We had a number of discussions with them about some of their ideas for
                    programs and how we might help with some of the infrastructure to both protect
                    the area and maybe create more of a viable national park out of that area. One
                    of the Ecuadorian officers on our agricultural and natural resources staff was
                    one of the premiere environmental people in Ecuador, so he was personally both
                    experienced and very motivated in this area. I was fascinated by natural
                    resources conservation and wildlife for a long time, especially after our
                    experiences in Africa.</p>
                <p>It all came together in a program that we began to develop in 1988 or 1989 that
                    would try to address the environmental issues, the biological diversity issues
                    that existed in several areas that were under pressure, but would also recognize
                    the needs of people who lived in or around those areas. We were looking at a
                    combination of conservation and development programs. I think this was one of
                    the earlier examples of this kind of approach to recognizing the
                    interrelationships between biological diversity, conservation and development
                    concerns and sustainable use of resources which have a vast amount of
                    diversity.</p>
                <p>Another thing that I didn't mention, but it is a theme that runs through here, is
                    the debt crisis of the 1980s and the beginnings of the idea of swapping some of
                    this debt for nature. Ecuador, like all Latin American countries, had a
                    tremendous backlog of foreign debt and so there were some opportunities for
                    doing that there. I think we really pioneered some new activities in this area
                    and the debt-swap program was one of the initiatives that I personally took. The
                    program we financed was a natural resources management project involving farming
                    on steep hillsides that CARE was carrying out. But by becoming interested in the
                    idea of a debt-swap, that whole effort got us involved with a variety of other
                    organizations and innovative financial approaches in the environment and natural
                    resources area. So, with a number of folks inside and outside the mission, we
                    began to think creatively about how to put together a program that would combine
                    development and biodiversity conservation approaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SMITH: This was 1988-89. The other twist that we put on this was the one I said
                    we would come back to later on, and that is my whole approach and growing
                    conviction about the right way to do project designs. What we did in this
                    process is, and again, Washington intervened to make our life difficult, to try
                    to get the approval of the project at the PID (product identification document)
                    stage. On the basis of that approval, we would then proceed with contracting the
                    implementors for the program, and have as the first task for the
                    “implementation” contract the final design of the project. This would include
                    the selection of the areas where the project would work. The idea was that the
                    contractor would work jointly with the counterpart organizations on development
                    of the detailed plan, with the view that once that stage was done there would be
                    a kind of “punctuation mark” when we would review the final design and approve
                    the project in the field. We felt this could be a much accelerated process,
                    handled in country with the people who would then carry on to implement the
                    project. There might be a gap of two or three months between design and
                    implementation, but we would try to bridge that with some overlap between the
                    two phases of this process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The designers would be the ones who implemented it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. It took a little doing. Actually, AID had a mechanism called
                    “collaborative assistance” that was designed to encourage university involvement
                    in development programs, but did foresee this kind of program where the design
                    organization could be a private voluntary organization (PVO) or a private
                    contractor. In the collaborative assistance concept, it would be a university
                    that would presumably carry on the implementation of a program once it was
                    approved. We used that collaborative assistance concept, but with the idea of
                    involving PVOs instead of universities to do that. We planned that the PID we
                    put together would identify that process, and would identify the broad objective
                    that we were trying to achieve and the parameters within which we planned to
                    work. It would ask for the authority to contract following PID approval for the
                    technical assistance provider, with the view that they would also continue
                    during implementation of the project. And the PID would request authority to
                    approve the final project paper in the field, without having to come back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Well, that was a little bit ahead of its time. I was pretty much behind this
                    whole idea, but I did not go to Washington to make the case for that approach,
                    but rather the people in the agriculture office did. It worked out that they
                    were going to be in Washington anyway. Theoretically, we were going to economize
                    on the staff, and I don't know if it would have made any difference anyway. But,
                    like the Swaziland health project case, Washington wasn't ready for our vision
                    and maybe we were moving too quickly, maybe we were being a little bit too
                    flexible on this. What the bureau asked for before allowing us to proceed was
                    basically for us to document our strategy in the environment and natural
                    resources area. To be honest, we probably didn't have the strategy well
                    articulated and it certainly didn't exist on paper, and we may have been going a
                    little bit too ad hoc and sort of looking at this as a target of opportunity
                    without a particularly well thought out strategy.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>But the net effect of that was to set the whole process back by a year. We had
                    gotten to the point of writing the PID presenting these ideas and getting ready
                    to go with that approach, when everything was sort of put on the shelf and we
                    were told that before Washington was ready to talk about a project, they needed
                    to know what our strategy was going to be for working in the environment and
                    natural resources area. And, of course, we hadn't planned on that and there was
                    nobody to do the strategy and it took a year, maybe more, until we went through
                    that thought process and writing process to send Washington the strategy
                    document. In the end it didn't really change materially the project itself, but
                    did set us back a significant period of time.</p>
                <p>So when I left Ecuador, we were only really just getting started with the
                    project. The PID was finally approved in 1990 and we were just getting started
                    on the request for applications for the implementors who would carry out the
                    final design and then eventually implement the project. The project became known
                    as the SUBIR project, the sustainable use of biological resources project, and
                    eventually was awarded to a consortium of the Nature Conservancy and CARE and
                    one other environmental organization. I hear it has done reasonably well. That
                    is the project of all the ones that I have been associated with, even though it
                    is not one I actually physically wrote as a project design officer, that I would
                    consider to be “mine” more than any others in my career. But, it wasn't
                    consummated successfully during my time there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the things that you were trying to
                        promote?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The idea was to take several areas of high biological diversity in the
                    country, most of which actually had, at least on paper, a formal park or reserve
                    status or core of one. To look at ways both to manage those parks or reserves
                    that would involve local people, would make the park or reserve a meaningful
                    concept, not just a piece of land with a fence around it trying to keep
                    everybody out, and to look also at buffer zone areas in the immediate vicinity
                    as a way to carry out agriculture and other economic activities that were
                    compatible with those forest areas (most the areas were forest although there
                    were some high mountain areas as well), and look at kind of an integrated,
                    sustainable sort of development-with-conservation approach to some key physical
                    areas in the country that would encompass some significant locations for high
                    biological diversity.</p>

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SMITH: The World Wildlife Fund then had a program called “Wildlands and Human
                    Needs”, sort of a “parks-and-people” kind of notion. And the Biodiversity
                    Support Program that AID still finances through a consortium which includes WWF
                    was actually one of the vehicles for some of the early design work there. This
                    whole notion of combining conservation with the recognition of the development
                    needs and the behaviors and cultural attitudes of communities—looking at this
                    very much as a community based conservation approach—this probably wasn't the
                    first time that this ever happened, but it was not as widespread and as accepted
                    as it is now. This was intended to be among the early efforts in this area and
                    was one reason why it was all the more frustrating that we got hung up on this
                    semi-bureaucratic requirement to do a strategy, which cost us a year in actually
                    getting into the field with something like this. And, on a personal level, it
                    cost me the opportunity to see that effort, to nurture it, into its
                    implementation. But, the program has done okay.</p>
                <p>I guess the consortium members had a falling out along the way and had some
                    difficulties of that nature, but I hear they are working on a new program. In
                    fact, I just learned last week that the mission in Ecuador is very much involved
                    in and looking at the next generation of its strategy and program in this area,
                    building on the experience of that project. Even though the program in Ecuador
                    is fast disappearing, this is one of the areas that they are preserving and
                    really focusing on as one of their last remaining activities. So, the legacy of
                    that kind of lives on.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I was most pleased with was pioneering a new look at
                    things, a new way of doing things, and consciously not taking the conventional
                    approach to things but saying, “Here is a problem, let's see if we can fix it.”
                    Both the SUBIR project, where we applied the collaborative approach, as well as
                    pioneering a number of things involving debt swaps—these were two things that I
                    did in Ecuador and were largely things that I could say would not have happened,
                    certainly not the way they happened, without my involvement. They were fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there something particular about the debt swap?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The opportunity existed to use a small amount of money to leverage a large
                    program because of the discounts that were being given on Ecuadorian debt.
                    Ecuadorian debt was sold on the secondary market for eleven cents on the dollar
                    in those days. So, you could buy a dollar's worth of Ecuadorian debt for eleven
                    cents. The government, partly through our working with them, developed an
                    approach for exchanging debt purchased in that way, swapping that debt for local
                    currency at fifty cents on the dollar. So, they got their debt retired in effect
                    for half price. But since the price of that was eleven cents you also got a
                    multiplier 4 or 5 times yourself. We worked at two levels on this.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>One, we worked closely with CARE, which had had a grant from us for a natural
                    resource management project which involved on-farm terracing and irrigation
                    activities, sustainable agricultural activities on steep hillside farming. We
                    worked with them to extend that program through the vehicle of a debt swap. CARE
                    was very interested in doing that in those days. We basically were able to make
                    a $250,000 grant to CARE, which was leveraged into, by the time everything was
                    said and done, a $1.2 million program to carry on their sustainable agriculture
                    hillside farming activities there.</p>
                <p>In the process of doing that we then got into some very active discussions with
                    the government of Ecuador about their general policy and the general use of this
                    device as a tool for development, both in natural resources and other things.
                    There was a group called the Debt for Development Coalition which had a couple
                    of people working on these issues worldwide and they came down and worked with
                    the Vice President's office. The Vice President of Ecuador was very interested
                    in this whole area, took a personal interest in it and was very much behind the
                    development of the government of Ecuador's policies and procedures for using
                    debt swaps for development purposes in natural resources, education and other
                    kinds of things. So, because of our interest in this specific program we were
                    able to work more generally with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was AID debt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. It was our money in this case. The $250,000 was a grant to CARE, which
                    then used that money, and I think some of its own as well, to purchase
                    commercial debt of Ecuador on the secondary market and at eleven or thirteen
                    cents or whatever it was. In the final analysis, they were able to buy that
                    multiple, 8 times that, so $2 million worth of Ecuadorian debt face value, then
                    exchange that in Ecuador for a million dollars worth of local currency and then
                    program the local currency for the cost of its programs. So, it wasn't AID debt,
                    but a small grant from us to CARE which allowed them to purchase commercial debt
                    on the market and use the proceeds for their programs.</p>
                <p>So, all around that is why I would say that Ecuador is the high water mark of my
                    career. I had an excellent working relationship with the director. The role I
                    played was one very much the internal mission management role and in that role
                    made some significant progress or did some significant things. But more
                    importantly, I had an opportunity to develop some skills and experience in
                    management training, team work, working together on a strategic planning effort
                    to guide the focus of the program. We had a very interesting program, and a lot
                    of implementation problems, but over time we dealt with those problems, pared
                    the portfolio of the bad apples and focused it on the things that were crucial
                    to our objectives, reflected a significant private sector role along with
                    government, and a couple of initiatives in which I was able to play personally a
                    key role that involved some very innovative programming and were in an area I
                    was very much interested in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A year's sabbatical at the National War College - 1990</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think something to talk about a little bit to give the context for the
                    next move are the activities that my wife got involved in while we were
                    overseas, because in large part that was what motivated our next move. When we
                    were in Bolivia and Haiti we had very young children, so mostly what she did was
                    take care of them. First of all, my wife is a registered nurse and had a lot of
                    both medical and intensive care experience in nursing. But, after the birth of
                    our first son, she got very interested in the birthing process and later in
                    breast feeding promotion. While we were in Bolivia, and Haiti to a lesser
                    extent, she gave Lamaze birthing classes to other couples who were about to have
                    their babies. When we were in southern Africa, and later in Ecuador, the
                    children were a little bit older and in school all day and this allowed her to
                    do some other things. She didn't really work in a paid job, but did a lot of
                    volunteer work, starting in Swaziland with the family planning organization. She
                    got involved in a number of activities related to family planning and breast
                    feeding promotion. Later, when we went to Zimbabwe she continued that and got
                    very active in the whole area of public health and breast feeding promotion,
                    mother and infant care. Likewise in Ecuador, she and another person helped to
                    establish the Ecuador chapter of LaLeche League, a breasting feeding promotion
                    organization. Over the three years we were there, she became more and more
                    interested and involved in those kinds of issues. As our time in Ecuador was
                    coming to a close she was very interested in going back to school and getting a
                    Masters degree in public health. So, the timing of our departure from Ecuador
                    was in large part related to giving her an opportunity to come back to school
                    and to pursue that Masters degree. She was accepted at Johns Hopkins and so we
                    looked for a way to arrange a move back to the Washington area so she could
                    attend that Masters degree program for a year.</p>
                <p>We weren't certain at the time whether we wanted to stay in the States for just a
                    year and then go back overseas again or maybe stay here for a longer period of
                    time. The idea we talked about was for me to see if I could get long term
                    training approved in the Washington area following our Ecuador assignment. I was
                    approved to attend the National War College, starting in the fall of 1990. My
                    wife had actually been accepted into the Johns Hopkins program a year before,
                    but had requested an extension of that admission for a year, so we were able to
                    orchestrate this quite nicely. So, both of us ended up in the Washington area
                    and both in school for the academic year of 1990-91.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The War College experience for me was quite interesting. In the first instance,
                    it was a nice time to step out of the more active career path or active
                    involvement in day-to-day activities for AID. It was a time to sit back and
                    reflect. I actually hadn't taken that kind of time off to go to school for close
                    to 20 years at that point. What I was looking for in that long term training
                    assignment was a chance to step back and reflect some on the experiences that I
                    had had and try to build on those, try to make some greater sense out of them
                    for the future.</p>
                <p>I must say that the War College curriculum probably wasn't the ideal thing that I
                    was looking for. The course work there is basically a year long seminar in
                    American foreign policy and is intended primarily for military
                    officers—something like 75 percent of the student body are fairly senior
                    military officers, colonels, lieutenant colonels, or equivalent. It is kind of
                    their school to give people who are at a fairly senior level already and who the
                    military considers to have good potential for the general officer ranks to get a
                    broader perspective in this area than what they may have had in their careers so
                    far. So, it was a broad sweep of US foreign policy interests, what was going on
                    in different parts of the world, and included an opportunity to take two or
                    three courses per semester that focused on various aspects—largely military
                    aspects, but also some issues related to foreign policy concerns or the history
                    of American diplomacy or, in a couple of cases but not very many, economic
                    issues internationally. As such, it really didn't focus as much on development
                    issues, economic or social, as it did on broad foreign policy issues.</p>
                <p>Of course, the vast majority of the students who were there had very little
                    knowledge and frankly very little interest in the AID type of work in developing
                    countries. I often thought while I was there that the primary reason for having
                    the 25 percent of the class that represented a whole variety of civilian
                    government agencies was to give some perspective within the student body to the
                    military students who were there and to help expand their horizons. I suppose
                    the flip side of that was also true, but in my case, as will probably be obvious
                    from our past discussions about southeast Asia and Central America, never having
                    served in the military and being somewhat negative about military operations,
                    this wasn't exactly my primary interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a chance to speak to the group or talk to
                        people about development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Quite a bit. I was able to speak up quite a bit about development
                    interests, but I guess more than anything I was impressed that this was a group
                    that was generally fairly hostile to a major US government foreign assistance
                    role in developing countries. They questioned very outspokenly the value of
                    those kinds of programs. In that sense, I suppose, it was more representative of
                    the political situation in the country, the high degree of skepticism about the
                    results of US foreign assistance, the sort of anti-foreign aid mentality that
                    peaked later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything specific, an experience, about that
                        view or was it just sort of a general negativism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there wasn't much in the way of experience because most of their
                    experience had either been domestically, or if it had been overseas it had been
                    places where there are US bases or military operations. I think it reflected the
                    general skepticism about the value of the results that were being accomplished.
                    Many developing countries were considered bottomless pits and full of corruption
                    and leaders who didn't care about their people. And, of course, there are plenty
                    of examples of that to give that view some credibility. But in of spectrum that
                    we have discussed before about how US interests are best served by foreign
                    assistance, I sense that the view of that group generally was much more along
                    the lines of the short term foreign policy interests than any support for long
                    term development.</p>
                <p>The vast majority of civilian students were from the State Department and given
                    my past experience and perspective on the State Department people, it was
                    interesting to me that within that environment I found myself much closer to my
                    State Department colleagues than I did to the military folk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any sensitivity for poverty, the poor people
                        of the world, the disruptive effects of people left out of the
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Frankly, very little. There were some people who were more open to that
                    view, but the prevailing view was quite negative about that. As was a view that
                    had existed for some time and peaked probably a little bit later in the massive
                    reductions in foreign assistance over the 1990s and the various proposals to do
                    away with the Agency for International Development and some of those kinds of
                    things. I think this was very consistent with that particular mentality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sense of change of attitudes or
                        understanding over the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. It wasn't really a focus of the course. The course of studies didn't
                    take an editorial position in favor of that or against it. It wasn't a process
                    of organized learning where I found people came out much more favorably disposed
                    towards foreign assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any high level policy leaders who spoke about
                        long term issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SMITH: There were a large number of people who came from outside. In fact, a
                    feature of the War College curriculum was a number of invited speakers
                    throughout the area who came and some did focus on that. There was a regional
                    focus to the program. In fact, the War College experience includes a two-week
                    overseas trip somewhere in the world during the spring. Each student is required
                    to specialize or to study a region of the world, generally the region that
                    corresponds to the location of the trip that he or she goes on. There were a
                    couple of trips to Latin America, typically to the more advanced places or one
                    that had foreign policy issues—Central America, the Andes and the drug issues,
                    etc. There were no trips, no study about Africa, for example, which is quite
                    interesting in hindsight since in the '90s there have been a couple of military
                    deployments to Africa. But none of that was on the radar screen or the War
                    College curriculum in 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody foresaw the role of the military in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. Not in Somalia. What was getting a lot of attention, obviously, was
                    Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Again, this was 1990-91 and the revolutions
                    in Central and Eastern Europe had occurred the year before and that was what was
                    really attracting a lot of attention—all the changes and openness now, the
                    political and military dimensions of those changes, the effect it would have on
                    NATO, the effect it would have on military cooperation and cooperation generally
                    with countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. There was also some
                    speculation about what the Soviet Union was going to become. This was a couple
                    years from the demise of the Soviet Union, itself, but, of course, there already
                    was a lot of ferment and excitement around the openness. So, to the extent there
                    was a large magnet that attracted people and attracted attention, it was there,
                    not Latin America, not Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Going back a little bit to the path my career had taken, I really felt
                    that because of the events that had occurred in Zimbabwe and the lack of any
                    other postings in Africa at that time, that our time in Africa had really been
                    cut short prematurely. I went back to Ecuador because it was Ecuador and it had
                    the kind of program I was interested in, and was the kind of place where I
                    wanted to be. But, I did not feel like turning my back on Africa and saying,
                    “Well, this had been a mistake and I am going back home to Latin America.” So,
                    what I wanted to do in the rest of my career, and to concentrated my studies as
                    well, was to focus more on Africa. I was really interested in spending the rest
                    of my AID career in Africa and I had hoped that this opportunity in long term
                    training would help me learn more about that, that it would be a vehicle for
                    getting back to Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>But, as I just mentioned, the War College was blind to Africa. Africa wasn't on
                    their map, there was no trip, no regional studies, there was nothing. So, I got
                    swept up in the tide with everybody else focusing on Central and Eastern Europe,
                    which was a very interesting tide to be in. It was interesting to think about in
                    relation to some of the comparative politics courses I had taken in graduate
                    school. Of course, a lot of my issues with American foreign policy over the
                    years had been sort of related to the fight against communism, and here was
                    communism sort of collapsing of its own weight. People were coming out of that
                    form of government and trying to become more democratic, more open to Western
                    economic systems. So, it was a fascinating period and was really very
                    interesting.So, that is the area that I focused on. A couple of the courses I
                    took and papers I wrote attempted to relate what was happening then in Central
                    and Eastern Europe to some of the changes that had occurred earlier in Latin
                    America. I tried to make that sort of comparative analysis. But, Central and
                    Eastern Europe was the focus that I took geographically and ended up going on
                    the trip that went to Poland and Czechoslovakia, which was a really fascinating
                    trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before AID got involved in those countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was just as AID was beginning to get involved. The trip was in April or
                    early May of 1991 and I think the first AID offices had just opened in the
                    region that spring. So, things were just beginning to change, AID was just
                    beginning to get involved, the whole US government was just beginning to engage
                    and figure out what kind of foreign assistance program might make sense in that
                    situation, which, of course, was quite different from the ones we had
                    traditionally been involved in. I tried to pick up as much of that focus as I
                    could, but that really wasn't the primary interest of most of the people, who
                    were more interested in the military dimensions of things, which, of course, for
                    someone who had spent their whole career in the military was probably even more
                    fascinating. Here were countries that were behind the iron curtain and enemies,
                    the Warsaw Pact countries, and all the opportunities for collaboration and
                    interaction with them just didn't exist before. That was largely the focus that
                    the trip took and the group in general took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write a paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>SMITH: I wrote a couple of papers. One, an independent study that I did in lieu
                    of a course, was trying to make some comparisons between the economic and
                    political reforms that occurred in Latin America and the similar circumstances
                    in Central and Eastern Europe. This gave me a chance to study a little more the
                    kinds of things that we had been involved with in Ecuador and other places, the
                    political economy of policy change in the early '80s and its implications,
                    including the whole issue of social safety nets and the impact of structural
                    adjustment on poor population and those kinds of things. I tried to make some
                    comparisons and perhaps conjecture what issues or what challenges might confront
                    the countries, particularly Poland and Czechoslovakia, in the future based to
                    some extent on the Latin American experience. It gave me an opportunity both to
                    look a little more closely at the Latin America experience from an more academic
                    standpoint, and to focus my attention and studies in Eastern Europe on economic
                    and social issues.</p>
                <p>We actually wrote a number of papers throughout the course of the year in the War
                    College, for the major core seminar, as well as for some of our individual
                    courses. So, I did a lot of writing that year, which gave me an opportunity to
                    delve a little more deeply on some of those kinds of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an AID member on the faculty as there has been
                        more recently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, Jim Holtaway was there at the time. I think the understanding at that
                    time that AID had with the War College was that they would provide a person for
                    the faculty in exchange for two slots for students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he give courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, he gave a course on economic development and it was a good course.
                    However, I think I was probably more of a resource to my fellow classmates than
                    being in a situation where I was learning a whole lot from them. Jim was also my
                    adviser there. One of the things I was able to arrange with him was actually to
                    teach one session of the seminar, based on the research I was doing on this
                    comparative analysis of Latin America and Eastern Europe and some of the
                    structural adjustment, impacts and changes. So, that gave me an opportunity in a
                    small way to try out a teaching role and see how I would like that, and also to
                    try to condense a lot of material down into a two-hour seminar session that
                    would hold people's interest and communicate the essence of what I was getting
                    out of my learning.</p>
                <p>There was another AID person there at the same time as well, and there were two
                    AID people at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, ICAF, which is also
                    located at Fort McNair here in Washington. So there were actually four AID folks
                    on the campus and we would get together from time to time to compare notes and
                    see how things were going.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>In general, it was a very good year in many respects. It gave me time to reflect
                    to some extent. It certainly gave me time to focus on what was happening in
                    Central and Eastern Europe in a way that I had never been particularly
                    interested in before. I did some interesting things and it gave me a lot of
                    flexibility in my schedule, frankly, so that we could balance and juggle all of
                    the responsibilities here when my wife was traveling to Baltimore every day and
                    staying up there one or two nights a week. But, I don't know that from the
                    standpoint of what I wanted from a year of long term training, in terms of
                    development substance and a chance to really have an opportunity to learn not
                    only from the courses I was taking but from my fellow students and to deepen and
                    broaden my knowledge of development, and to focus on Africa, that it was as good
                    as it might have been.</p>
                <p>I don't want to sound sour about that in that it is a unique opportunity that
                    only a few people have. It did give me an exposure to military culture, which I
                    had not had and haven't had since. That was a culture shock of its own, but it
                    did give me a better sense of the military organization, their way of thinking.
                    So, it was broadening, but not necessarily broadening in the way that I would
                    have hoped. I suppose if my interests had been moving more towards the foreign
                    policy arena, diplomacy, which is not inappropriate for someone moving into the
                    AID director ranks, it would have been a little more satisfying. But, that
                    wasn't particularly my interest, so it wasn't a perfect match in terms of what I
                    was looking for and hoping to get from it. Nonetheless, it certainly was a
                    worthwhile year and I don't write it off as a waste of time by any means.
                    Personally, it came at a very good time and worked out quite well in terms of
                    our personal situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you recommend that AID continue that relationship?
                        Is that the best use of AID resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't know what the resources are that are involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paying your salary for one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, paying my salary and also paying the salary and other expenses of
                    someone on the faculty there. I guess that depends on one's vision of AID. If
                    one looks at AID as increasingly part of the political instruments of foreign
                    policy in a shorter term sense and it is, therefore, important for its
                    leadership to have that broader perspective of military and other national
                    security organizations and to know what their roles and functions are, then I
                    think that is good. I think more and more, whether through relief operations,
                    programs in Eastern Europe, or the continued drug programs in South America
                    where there is involvement of a variety of actors within the US government, it
                    certainly would be beneficial. And, probably that is the direction in which the
                    agency is going frankly, and is not necessarily going in the direction of being
                    a better development organization. So, in that context I think probably “yes”
                    would be the answer to the question. ButI lament that trend, as is probably
                    obvious and will become more so, because I do think there is a role for the
                    agency to be viewed as more of a development agency than a US foreign policy
                    tool.</p>
                <p>I guess I would also argue for perhaps a little better matching of candidates for
                    long term training with the opportunities that exist. In my case, I wanted to be
                    in the Washington area, and this was in a sense a freebie. There are some costs
                    associated with it, but there was no cash outlay. What I originally wanted to do
                    was to go to a fellowship program at Georgetown University, which was in
                    development, but that actually involved a cash outlay of funds. The War College
                    didn't involve that and so that is where they sent me.</p>
                <p>In some respects, the more difficult aspect of that year was not being remembered
                    in your agency. It is one of those things that one hears said a lot about long
                    term training, but I experienced it first hand. You get out of the system and
                    people forget about you. It was difficult, even though I was right here in town,
                    to reenter and to find a place for a new assignment. Part of that was in terms
                    of what I wanted to do. Frank Almaguer, who had been the director in Ecuador,
                    also, as it happened, ended up going to long term training that same year. We
                    both left Quito together and he came to the Senior Seminar at the Foreign
                    Service Institute. He had the same experience. We compared notes from time to
                    time. Basically it was an out of sight, out of mind situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>As I say, in my case that was partly complicated by what I wanted to do, which
                    was not to go back to Latin America. I had been in the Latin America region when
                    I went to the War College, and there was talk that before people would go to
                    long term training their onward assignment would be assured before they even
                    entered. That did not happen in our case. But, I wanted to get back to Africa.
                    For reasons that I guess were later clarified but at the time were difficult for
                    me to understand, I was not able to get in to see the people in the African
                    bureau who were responsible for making assignment decisions during that winter
                    and spring when those decisions were being made. I guess that there was a
                    feeling, which was interesting and certainly not my perspective, that when I
                    left Zimbabwe I had kind of abandoned the African bureau, and so “forget him”.
                    That wasn't my view of it at all. In fact, I had talked to the bureau about
                    other assignments in Africa before I had even raised the issue with Latin
                    America to go to Ecuador. However, there was this perception in the Africa
                    bureau that I had abandoned them and gone back to Latin America and therefore
                    was not someone who they would necessarily welcome back. It took me a number of
                    months actually to find that out.</p>
                <p>A new venture with the Europe Bureau - 1991</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I wasn't really looking around for much of anything else. I
                    wasn't interested in going back to Latin America. In the end, to make a long
                    story short, I ended up going to talk with the people who were just forming the
                    Europe bureau of AID at that time. The Eastern Europe program was just getting
                    started in 1990-91 and a few posts were opening up then. The bureau that was
                    responsible for these programs was what had been the Asia and Near East bureau
                    and then the Asia, Near East and Europe bureau. Later, the Asia part was broken
                    off and combined with the Private Enterprise bureau in a sort of interesting
                    arrangement during the Bush administration. This left Europe and the Near East.
                    In 1991, there was to be a further split with the Near East and Europe becoming
                    separate bureaus. In the context of that, there were a number of positions
                    opening up in the new Europe region. There was an interesting experiment in
                    organization for that program which was to create a regional mission for Europe
                    in Washington which would have a lot of the traditional AID overseas mission
                    responsibilities for the program. The concept was to have it located in
                    Washington because a lot of the Eastern Europe programs were heavily influenced
                    by the State Department and other agencies. There was also concern about keeping
                    the number of US direct hires who were physically located in the countries
                    small. Cost was a consideration, but language and experience issues were also
                    there as well. So, the model was to create this regional mission for Europe in
                    Washington with then small—maybe two to five US direct hire—AID representative
                    offices in each of the countries of the region. The regional mission then would
                    be a integral part of the bureau for Europe in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Frank and I actually had talked about this for a little bit and both of us were
                    independently talking to people in the Europe bureau, Carol Edelman, who is the
                    assistant administrator, and David Merrill, the deputy. Because this new
                    regional mission for Europe was completely new, they were looking for both a
                    director and a deputy director at that time,. We thought it would be a good idea
                    to put the winning team back together again from Ecuador. But, I think Carol and
                    David were a little concerned, and probably rightly so, about two unknown
                    quantities taking over responsibility for what was the central organization in
                    this new program. So, instead of that, they selected Frank as the director of
                    the regional mission, but they asked Bob Nachtrieb, who had been the director of
                    the program office in the bureau, to be Frank's deputy and then asked me to be
                    the director of the program office in the bureau for Europe. So that is the
                    position that I took beginning in July/August 1991.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating time in many respects. The whole program was extremely
                    different from anything that I had experienced before. It was different in terms
                    of the countries where we were working. It was different in terms of the
                    structure of the program because it involved not only a lot of US government
                    agencies who had not traditionally participated in AID activities, but there was
                    a conscious effort to reach out to involve a lot of US private organizations,
                    both for profit and nonprofit, who were not the traditional sort of AID
                    constituents. I think this was good from a number of perspectives, not the least
                    of which was that the situation in those countries was different than it was in
                    Africa or Latin America. They were dealing with a different kind of development
                    challenge and one in which arguably a lot of the organizations whose work was
                    largely domestic in this country, or maybe in other European countries, was more
                    relevant than it would be to Africa or Latin America or Asia. So, there was a
                    real reaching out to try to involve some nontraditional organizations in that
                    program.</p>

                <p>SMITH: On the US government side there were about 20 different government
                    agencies involved in one way or another in our foreign assistance program to
                    Eastern Europe, whereas maybe there were three or four that were conventionally
                    involved in Latin America and Africa. There were a lot of private organizations,
                    cooperatives, ones that were involved with civil society and democracy promotion
                    programs. This was a little bit ahead of the major emphasis that AID now has put
                    in those areas. A lot of legal and judicial organizations, bar associations.
                    Both political parties had development institutes which began to come into
                    flower about that time, more oriented towards what was happening in Eastern
                    Europe. There were also some ethnic American organizations that were
                    representative of Polish-Americans, or Czech-Americans or Hungarian-Americans.
                    There were a variety of those organizations and people who because of their
                    regional interests were not ones who knew much about AID or had been involved
                    with us before that. Some private business and finance organizations
                    representing the kind of business opportunities that were envisioned to exist in
                    Eastern Europe were not, again, comparable to what might have existed in Africa,
                    Latin America or Asia. They were organizations who represented more higher
                    sophisticated industries, perhaps, and went beyond those involved in traditional
                    AID programs.</p>
                <p>Organizationally, there were two features of that program that were also
                    extremely interesting. One was not particularly satisfying, the other one was
                    potentially so. The first one was the fact that the State Department became
                    involved because of the highly political nature of these programs and the fact
                    that US assistance in the region was authorized through specific legislation,
                    not just an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. There was a special Support
                    for Eastern Europe Democracy (SEED) Act that was the channel for funds to
                    Central and Eastern Europe, and subsequently, a similar Freedom Support Act for
                    the former Soviet Union. This legislation called for an overall US coordinator
                    for assistance to those countries, who was the Deputy Secretary of State. So,
                    there was a whole office within the State Department whose role it was to
                    coordinate the assistance program. They got very involved in a lot of the
                    details, both the individual project activities as well as the overall
                    strategies—or the decision not to have long term strategies in those countries
                    in order to maintain the flexibility to respond to circumstances as they
                    evolved. The State Department was initial very much opposed to country funding
                    levels and things that State felt would make this into a more traditional AID
                    approach where recipient countries would feel entitled to a certain amount of
                    funding irrespective of whether there were worthwhile projects or whether
                    programs were being implemented well. This was also State's attitude about
                    staffing in the field. The State Department kept a tight grip on how many AID
                    folks could be in the field.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Although the funds were appropriated to AID, the State Department felt that it
                    was very much in charge of the overall program. It was very much a proponent of
                    handing major chunks of the program to the Treasury Department, to the EPA, to
                    the Agriculture Department, to the Commerce Department, to a whole variety of
                    other US government agencies, which created a whole legal and implementation
                    scenario which we just weren't used to dealing with. It was our money,
                    appropriated to AID, and yet here were other government agencies with their own
                    rules and without much experience dealing overseas, carrying out programs
                    directly. You can just imagine the tremendous complications that involved.</p>
                <p>That was one aspect of it. The other aspect that I thought was very interesting
                    and a potential model for the future was this regional mission in Washington
                    concept. Theoretically, in an age where communications were becoming much
                    better, e-mail and a computer on everybody's desk was becoming a fact of life in
                    the early '90s, and given the tremendous costs of travel and time, etc., it made
                    a lot of sense to think creatively about alternative ways of organizing
                    ourselves. This regional mission seemed to have a lot of potential, not only for
                    the programs in Eastern Europe but also conceivably in other parts of the world,
                    whether it was located in Washington or located elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I think this concept broke down in practice. Not that it was
                    unsuccessful; it just became a lot less than it had potential for becoming in a
                    couple of respects. Two that I will mention I think were quite serious. One is
                    that the internal politics within the bureau led to a decision that the
                    technical offices for the Eastern Europe program would remain apart from the
                    regional mission, and organized instead as an office within the bureau. So, in
                    effect, the regional mission was only part a regional mission in the sense of
                    being responsible for the programs, because it only had, structurally in the
                    mission, the program, the project development and the private sector offices.
                    All the traditional health and democracy and education and agricultural offices
                    were organized as a bureau office under a director who reported not to the
                    regional mission director but to the assistant administrator. This is especially
                    crucial because all of the projects that were undertaken in Eastern Europe were
                    regional projects, did not have specific country activities identified in
                    advance, but were regional efforts that were consciously put into place as a way
                    of allowing flexibility to respond to where the interest was and where there
                    were promising activities. All the project officers were in Washington, they
                    weren't in the field, and they weren't in the regional mission. They were in
                    this technical office that was part of the bureau. So, it set up a strange
                    situation where you had a regional mission and mission director which
                    theoretically was responsible for carrying out the program, but didn't have in
                    it the staff who were the project officers for activities being carried out in
                    the field. That only came together at the assistant and deputy assistant
                    administrator level. And, of course, you had all the State Department
                    involvement in the program as well, that made that regional mission concept,
                    even in Washington, an extremely awkward and difficult thing to carry out.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>The other factor was that the AID representatives in the field also reported
                    directly to the assistant administrator and deputy assistant administrator, not
                    through or to the regional director. So, you had a vision of a regional mission
                    for the Eastern European programs created in Washington which conceptually made
                    a lot of sense, yet you had two key dimensions of the responsibilities for the
                    regional program—the technical offices which included most of the project
                    officers and the field staffs of the AID representatives—which didn't report to
                    the director. So, even if you didn't have that whole State Department layer,
                    which in itself was a major complicating factor, the deck was stacked against
                    the regional mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant administrator at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Carol Edelman.</p>
                <p>My role in all of this was not anything that I have mentioned so far, but
                    actually was even more difficult to figure out because the bureau had created a
                    separate program and project development office which combined three traditional
                    functions: the program, the project development and economist functions for the
                    bureau. But, the Eastern European programs were mostly the only programs that
                    the bureau had. There were a few activities in Cyprus and Northern Ireland and
                    Portugal, but 95 percent of the activity that went on in the bureau was related
                    to Eastern Europe. So, here you had, in effect, a bureau that had one program,
                    with the mission literally around the corner, and then a bureau program office.
                    Trying to figure out what roles and responsibilities there were between the
                    bureau program office and the mission program office, when the mission included
                    95 percent of the activities of the bureau, was a very interesting dynamic. Yet
                    despite all of that, I think we got along very well. I know that a lot of people
                    had issues with both Carol Edelman and David Merrill, but I had nothing but a
                    good relationship with them. But it was just a very ambiguous organizational
                    situation and one that was frustrating both because of the of organizational
                    dynamics and because of the very different nature of the program and, of course,
                    the ever-present pressures to respond quickly. It was not a satisfying
                    situation, it was very stressful.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>What really got quite interesting and had the potential, I think, to make some
                    sense out of this structure as well as much more importantly to take advantage
                    of the experience that had been gained in Eastern Europe programs, was when the
                    Soviet Union collapsed in 1992. In advance of that we had already initiated a
                    major effort that tried to anticipate a similar kind of, but probably much
                    larger, assistance program to Russia and the other former Soviet republics. Here
                    was when what I would regard in a sense as one of the ugliest moments of
                    bureaucracy that played out. Carol Edelman and the Europe bureau took a lot of
                    the initiative to put together, to anticipate some of the events that would
                    affect the Soviet Union and try to put into place assistance programs in the
                    summer of 1991, a year before the actual events in the Soviet Union.
                    Anticipating that a change was likely, the bureau created an Office of Soviet
                    Affairs, as a precursor to larger assistance to the former Soviet republics. In
                    the fall of that year and into the winter, we began to design some of the
                    initial programs that would characterize the program in the new independent
                    states, the NIS.</p>
                <p>But, the leadership of the agency was not a fan of Carol Edelman and there were
                    things that I don't understand even to this day. There were clearly some real
                    issues between Ronald Roskins and others and Carol, which meant that rather than
                    letting the Europe bureau develop this program and giving her and the bureau the
                    support and confidence that made sense, a separate task force was created that
                    was not led by the Europe bureau but by Scott Spangler, who was at that point
                    the newly named head of operations. That was Roskins' experiment of creating his
                    three directorates, one of which was operations that oversaw all of the
                    geographic bureaus. A special task force was created under the directorate of
                    operations to lead, ostensibly on an ad hoc basis, the effort to strategize and
                    to conceptualize and to design the programs for the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Well, the Europe bureau participated in that and I was a principal participant,
                    as was Paul O'Farrell, who was the head of the office for Soviet Affairs within
                    the Europe bureau. In fact, Paul was more involved in it than I was. We were
                    involved over the fall and the winter with a lot of the planning activities
                    which led to the program in the former Soviet Union, both the organizational
                    structure within AID, the staffing and the Washington structure, and the
                    programs. The programs were really built and modeled after the regional programs
                    that had been put into place in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>The dark moment came when it became time to move beyond an ad hoc task force
                    planning a program to actually carrying out the program.. Rather than put that
                    responsibility in the Europe bureau, the decision was made in March 1992— a
                    decision that made no sense to me at the time, and obviously other people agreed
                    because it has been since reversed— that a separate task force of a more
                    permanent nature would be organized and put in place that would run the program.
                    This task force would continue to report directly to the operations directorate
                    and would not be part of the Europe bureau. I think it was only because of
                    bureaucratic jealousies and not wanting to give to Carol the larger role and
                    mandate that would have be implied if both Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
                    Union programs were channeled through her bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The Europe bureau had the relationships with the State Department, had two years
                    of experience at that point in operating these kinds of programs, and to start
                    all over again and create through this task force a parallel structure which
                    duplicated the structure that already existed in the Europe bureau didn't make
                    any sense programmatically or organizationally. It was a tremendous waste of
                    time, a tremendous waste of resources, because all of that had to be duplicated
                    instead of taking advantage of the resources that were there and the experience
                    people had.</p>
                <p>My involvement with the NIS program had largely been helping plan the whole
                    organizational structure in the field—a little early thinking about field
                    staffing, field responsibilities, where the subregional offices would be
                    created, what kinds of staff would be appropriate. In addition, I worked closely
                    with Paul O'Farrell in the office of Soviet Affairs and the technical offices to
                    try to put together the project papers or the equivalent to that to make
                    assistance available for the former Soviet republics.</p>
                <p>As part of this effort in the early spring of 1992, the agency and the bureau
                    were looking for people who could go out to the countries and begin to establish
                    a presence there. In the winter of 1991/92 there was a massive airlift of food
                    and warm clothing, so there had been a major high profile activity but there
                    were no ongoing development efforts on the ground. The structure of what were to
                    become the four subregional missions was still being sorted out. However, they
                    wanted to have someone go out to each of the four places and begin to establish
                    a presence and get things going. I was asked if I would go to Moscow to be the
                    first acting AID rep there, for a month or so, to get things started. I was
                    preparing to do that when two things happened. First was this decision to create
                    a permanent NIS task force and to separate the responsibilities for the program
                    from the Europe bureau. But, also, as I have said, despite the fascinating and
                    historic period of time this was, there was a lot of stress and strains. This
                    was not the kind of program that I had joined AID to be involved in. Not that it
                    was unimportant. Unlike my comments earlier about Central America and Southeast
                    Asia, I did not have a problem—philosophical or conceptional—with the program in
                    Eastern Europe. It was something that I felt we should be doing. It was very
                    exciting and innovative. It just wasn't a development program. My heart and
                    interests were, as I mentioned, to spend the rest of my career in Africa working
                    on those kinds of development issues. That is what I had sort of grown up with,
                    that was what I really wanted to focus on, and Eastern Europe and the former
                    Soviet Union programs were not that at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>So the combination of the stresses of the very fluid and unpredictable, undefined
                    organizational situation and my deeper interests in being involved in the more
                    conventional poverty-related development programs had, over that winter,
                    motivated me to have a couple of talks with the Africa bureau again. I talked
                    with John Hicks, who had been my predecessor in Zimbabwe as deputy director and
                    who I knew slightly from that experience. He was now the deputy assistant
                    administrator in the Africa bureau and had replaced the person who had kind of
                    barred the door to my re-entry to the Africa bureau. I had a couple of
                    conversations with John about possibly moving back to the Africa region.</p>
                <p>As it happened, in early 1992 the rains in southern Africa failed, ushering in
                    what was to be a significant drought in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you touch on the African drought and all that,
                        let's get a little feel for at that stage what were the core ideas about the
                        kinds of activities we should be pursuing in the NIS states in Eastern
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think there were three really. One was to help with the economic
                    transition, the transition from communist economics to a more free market
                    economic situation. That took a variety of different expressions, ranging from
                    the creation of enterprise funds in each country to serve as a vehicle for
                    venture capital and private investments and also assist with privatization of
                    state-owned industries. On perhaps the other end of the spectrum were
                    cooperatives. Agricultural cooperative organizations in this country were very
                    much involved in the program. There were activities aimed at smaller businesses,
                    as well as ones aimed at developing a legal and regulatory environment that
                    would be conducive to private enterprise. So, it included a whole range of
                    activities associated with conversion from a state dominated communist economic
                    system to an open free market one. That was the first.</p>
                <p>The second was democracy. That aspect of the program tried to strengthen the
                    change that people in that region had made, recognizing that in Eastern Europe
                    since the forties and in some countries since the beginning of the century,
                    there really had not been any openness in a political sense, so the whole
                    dynamic of democracy, both in terms of structures, the party structures and
                    elections, etc., but more importantly perhaps civil society and the rule of law,
                    the judicial system, the whole fabric of democratic society didn't exist. So,
                    major efforts were put into that as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The third area was really related to social safety nets that were needed because
                    of the other two transitions, the economic and the political transitions. It was
                    recognized that there were going to be dislocations, there were going to be
                    major hardships created by these changes. The question was how to help put into
                    place safety nets for those whose standard of living was going to decline. It
                    was particularly focused on health care issues and social services. Where there
                    was food assistance or other kinds of humanitarian assistance, it fell into that
                    category as well.</p>
                <p>So, I think they were the three principal focuses that first the Eastern European
                    program had taken and subsequently the one for the former Soviet Union adopted.
                    I think they were very appropriate. I talked a little bit about how the regional
                    mission could serve as a model for the future of AID, and I felt at the time and
                    feel still, that in some ways the kinds of programs we had were also models that
                    had relevance for the rest of the agency. I mentioned that a lot of the players,
                    a lot of the organizations that were vehicles for technical assistance or other
                    assistance in the Eastern Europe program and later the Soviet program, were not
                    the traditional consulting firms or PVOs that we had worked with. Some of them
                    were there, too, but there was a conscious effort to reach out to a much broader
                    range of organizations. I think that is relevant for the rest of the agency,
                    particularly in Asia and Latin America, where there is more in common now than
                    perhaps there was 20 or 30 years ago between organizations whose traditional
                    focus has been in the US and issues and development challenges in those parts of
                    the world. So, I credit Carol Edelman a lot for this change, for having a lot of
                    foresight and being a dynamic advocate for the kinds of programs that broke the
                    traditional mold of AID in a way that was quite relevant. I think these are
                    areas where a little more openness from the traditional development side of AID
                    could be helpful, not only in bringing to bear higher quality assistance, but
                    also in creating a broader constituency, a broader base of support for foreign
                    assistance operations. There is a little bit of a tradeoff there I suppose in
                    terms of the control that you have and maybe the kinds of programs that you
                    carry out, but I think that is a tradeoff certainly worth considering in other
                    parts of the world. So, I saw and see still the Eastern Europe and later the
                    former Soviet Union programs as models both organizationally for the agency as
                    well as substantively and programmatically for the agency. But, I don't know
                    that that has really caught on.</p>
                <p>I think it was also part of this whole bureaucratic politics stuff that people
                    tended to discredit Carol, to look at the Europe region and the bureau as
                    something different. It may also stem from the fact that these programs came at
                    a time when resources were already stretched and major new programs were
                    undertaken in what was, at best, a zero sum situation in terms of staff. The
                    Europe programs, given the priority that they had within the US government, were
                    seen by others as taking resources away from them or competing with them,
                    drawing staff and resources from the other traditional programs. So, rather than
                    being an environment where the rest of the agency could look to these programs
                    as models or suggestive of approaches to improve their management of their
                    programs, it was really more of a competition and marginalization process which
                    I think was extremely unfortunate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You want to talk about Africa now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, two things came together in the spring of 1992. One, there was a
                    major drought which in the winter of 1991/92 was becoming evident in southern
                    Africa, The US was beginning to think about gearing up a major relief effort
                    that would eventually involve about ten countries in the southern part of
                    Africa. John and I had talked and there was no office director position that was
                    available in the bureau in Washington at that time, but he was very interested
                    in trying to find someone to direct a task force that the Africa bureau and the
                    Food and Humanitarian Assistance bureau (FHA) was putting together to coordinate
                    what seemed like was going to be a major relief effort for the southern Africa
                    drought. He asked if I would be interested in doing that.</p>
                <p>When the decision was made to create a more permanent task force that would have
                    responsibilities for the program in the former Soviet Union and to take that
                    formally out of the Europe bureau, I was pretty displeased, as I have indicated.
                    So, even though I was scheduled to leave to go to Moscow within a couple of
                    weeks to be the acting AID rep, I felt that that was not appropriate, that when
                    the decision was made by the agency to take responsibility away from the bureau
                    that I was in, that the bureau then be asked to go ahead and make that
                    particular staffing contribution. This also coincided with the offer from the
                    Africa bureau to come over to help coordinate the relief effort for the drought.
                    So, at that point I said I didn't want to go to Moscow and what I really would
                    like to do was to go back to the Africa region, something I had wanted to do for
                    several years. This opportunity exists and really is something that would be
                    much more in line with the kinds of things I am interested in. So, I asked Carol
                    and David if they would allow me to do that and they agreed.</p>
                <p>New role as Director, Southern Africa Drought Emergency Task Force - 1992</p>
                <p>So, in April, 1992 after only about nine months, a fast and busy nine months, I
                    left the Europe bureau and went to Africa again. Initially I served as
                    co-director of the drought relief task force with Steve Brent, who was working
                    in the bureau at that time; when he was assigned to South Africa a few months
                    later, I became director of the task force.</p>
                <p>This, too, was a fascinating experience and a highly successful one, I must say.
                    The overview of the effort that I would give is that the US provided, in a
                    period of less than a year, close to $1 billion of resources to the countries of
                    southern Africa. The US response was tremendous. The drought happened at a time
                    when there were a lot of resources available for a variety of reasons. But this
                    effort was also a success because of the degree of cooperation and concern that
                    existed in the countries of the region and their ability to coordinate among
                    themselves—even with South Africa, which still was an apartheid regime at that
                    point. They were very pragmatic, working together on transportation coordination
                    and other things. This made the effort in southern Africa an enormously
                    successful one.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>One of the things that hopefully contributed to that success was the coordination
                    we were able to give to the program. As I mentioned earlier, the task force was
                    created as a joint effort between the Africa and FHA bureaus. Much of the
                    assistance we provided was food aid, which was managed by FHA. Disaster
                    assistance was managed by OFDA, which was also part of FHA. The Africa bureau
                    devoted a considerable amount of resources for development programs aimed not
                    only at responding to the drought but also to improving communications and
                    making the region and its economy more drought-resistant. So it was a true
                    partnership. There were some tensions and tugs and pulls from time to time as
                    you can imagine, but I think it worked extremely well.</p>
                <p>There was a steering committee, a group that was composed of people from both
                    bureaus, headed by John Hicks from the Africa bureau and Lois Richards from FHA
                    and a couple of other people, someone from State Department as well. Every week
                    or so there would be larger meetings that would include people from throughout
                    the government who were interested in the drought situation, including CIA, the
                    military, Agriculture, OMB and a whole variety of different actors. There was
                    good coordination within the government, a good structure within the agency. A
                    small task force was organized and put together. I think at the highest point we
                    had seven people working on the task force, but usually it was about half that
                    number. In fact, it was more of a challenge than the coordination effort itself
                    just to get people detailed to the task force to help carry out its functions.
                    In 1992, the agency was enormously stressed in terms of personnel. At the same
                    time the Soviet program was beginning to draw off people from the traditional
                    development bureaus. So, it was really tough to get people detailed even for a
                    few months to the task force. It was a constant effort to try to find people and
                    replace people who had served a month or two and were going back to their
                    positions, etc. It was kind of a motley crew that was put together: there were
                    some IDIs on rotation and a couple of contractors and other folks who were there
                    for a short periods of time. But, it worked out pretty well.</p>
                <p>The role we played in the task force was essentially two or three things. One was
                    to be a central point for information both about the drought itself and its
                    consequences and what was happening in the region, as well as the overall
                    assistance effort, so that everybody would know what everybody else knew. That
                    was a primary challenge of ours, to be a central point for information about not
                    only US assistance flows but European assistance flows and other UN agencies'
                    flows, what the new needs assessments were, what was happening in the field and,
                    of course, what the US government contributions were.</p>
                <p>A second principal role of the task force was the public affairs, public
                    relations side of things: making sure that the word got out about what the US
                    was doing. We also staffed out, although we usually did not participate
                    directly, a number of hearings that were held on the Hill about the drought and
                    the relief effort. We coordinated with the PVO community through a special group
                    set up with in interaction on the drought. We basically served as a point of
                    information and contact and public affairs to people outside the executive
                    branch of the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The third key function that we played was to try to spot opportunities for
                    programs, to play a little bit of a catalytic or promotional role around certain
                    kinds of things that we thought would be appropriate responses, and then try to
                    get the parts of the organization who were responsible for carrying out those
                    programs to put them in place. We very consciously did not take on ourselves any
                    implementation responsibilities. That wasn't the authority that was given to us
                    and it wasn't appropriate for a small ad hoc task force that had very little
                    continuity. But, what we did see as our role, where we thought there were
                    opportunities, was to work with the Africa bureau or Food for Peace office to
                    try to encourage them to carry out those programs, to try to resolve bottlenecks
                    or issues, or if there were communication problems between the two then try to
                    work those out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Comment a little bit about the scale of the drought issue
                        as you understood it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The scale was tremendous. There were major failures of the rains in that
                    region the summer of 1991-92. Tremendous loses of crops. The production maize
                    was 30-40 percent of normal. There were tremendous shortfalls that needed to be
                    met by either relief food or commercial imports. South Africa, which was
                    normally produced tremendous surpluses of corn, was also seriously affected and
                    had no surplus at all, in fact was drawing down on its own stocks. Zimbabwe,
                    which was the other surplus corn producer in the region, was very, very severely
                    hit and complicating that, it had in the previous year or two sold off a lot of
                    its substantial maize stocks to gain foreign currency for some of its
                    expenditures. So the drought came at a time when Zimbabwe's buffer stock was at
                    a particularly low ebb. So, there were tremendous problems, basically from
                    Tanzania south, affecting all of the countries in southern Africa—Zambia,
                    Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland,
                    as well as South Africa. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people were
                    at risk of dying from starvation or other drought related causes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main problem you had to address in trying to
                        meet this need?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>SMITH: The main issues were transportation and supply. In both cases the response
                    was magnificent, both from within the region as well as from outside. On
                    transportation first. Much of the port system and rail system which serves
                    southern Africa originates in South Africa. There was in the region at that time
                    considerable antipathy between South Africa and its neighbors over its internal
                    policies. And yet, despite that, there was a very close, if not very high
                    profile, working relationship between the frontline countries and South Africa
                    around port and rail transportation issues. There were even, and this was pretty
                    hard to imagine in the environment at that time, government people, middle level
                    people, from the governments of some of those countries who actually went and
                    worked in South Africa with the transportation people coordinating the ports and
                    rail system as a way of keeping communications going and working a whole
                    structure of transportation in the region. There was an increase of our
                    assistance to the ports and rail corridors from Mozambique into Zimbabwe and
                    Malawi, and also some assistance came in through Dar es Salaam and Tanzania and
                    down the rail to Zambia and across into Malawi as well. So, there was a lot of
                    effort. The regional program in southern Africa was still headquartered in
                    Harare and Ted Morse was the director there at that time. And, of course, Ted is
                    one who is very experienced in emergencies and played a key role and was sort of
                    a local, on-the-scenes or in-the-region coordinator for a lot of the US
                    assistance. The whole transportation mechanism worked extremely well.</p>
                <p>The other side was supply. There was a lot of flexibility even within countries
                    to swap supplies, to use what buffer stocks there were, for some commercial
                    sales from South Africa to other parts of the region, even though South Africa,
                    itself, was under a bit of a strain. On the US side, as I mentioned before, the
                    response was absolutely tremendous. It was just a coming together of somewhat
                    unique circumstances that haven't been repeated since. There were in the US at
                    that time substantial corn stocks and the Department of Agriculture, in
                    particular, had a lot of corn available through its Section 416 programs as well
                    as Title I of PL 480. In fact, most of the food, more than half, that was
                    provided by the US in response to the drought was Department of Agriculture
                    food, not AID food. It was close to a billion dollars worth. Hundreds of
                    thousands of tons of corn were provided.</p>
                <p>Another feature which I think was really innovative was that pretty much for the
                    first time AID approved some PL 480 Title II shipments to the region without
                    designating in advance where it would go. It was kept there as a swing stock,
                    allow us to see how things went in terms of the needs and how the individual
                    countries were doing in terms of the pledges that they were receiving for food
                    and other assistance from European countries and UN agencies. We actually had an
                    ability to respond even before the major appeal was out for food assistance,
                    because we had something like 45 thousand tons of corn that were literally on
                    the high seas as the emergency was beginning. We were able to use that in a
                    flexible way, and most of it ended up going to Malawi, which was at the end of
                    all the rail lines, the most distant point from any of the ports and the most
                    difficult place to get to. In that way we were able to head off some major
                    suffering and problems in Malawi.</p>

                <p>So, the internal regional cooperation on transportation and commercial purchases
                    among countries, cooperation between the frontline countries and South Africa,
                    which was somewhat without precedent, and then the generosity that was available
                    from the US and the flexibility in terms of moving things, etc., made it a very
                    successful relief effort. The next season the rains did come again and although
                    there wasn't a bumper crop by any means, the drought in effect was over and the
                    relief effort had been very successful in adverting any widespread disaster or
                    death.</p>
                <p>For the first few months Steve Brent and I shared the leadership responsibilities
                    for the task force. Steve handled most of the external relations issues and I
                    handled a lot of the information and program response questions. We shared the
                    overall direction of the task force. Steve then left, I think in September, and
                    went to South Africa on assignment and from that point on until I left the task
                    force in December, I was the director of the task force. But, the role that I
                    personally played was to define and oversee each of the areas that I mentioned
                    before. First was being the staff to the two bureaus and the three offices
                    involved in this, the Africa bureau, the Food for Peace office, and OFDA, for
                    issues related specifically to the drought. We didn't carry out implementation
                    responsibilities. We were there as kind of the catalyst, the coordinator, to
                    make sure that things were going on. We acted as the secretariat for the
                    meetings of the principals, documenting the agreements they took and following
                    up with the different offices to help trouble shoot any problems or to get
                    things done.</p>
                <p>We coordinated all the information on pledges, on deliveries, from other
                    countries and organizations as well as our own, so we could track the
                    performance of the response to a major appeal that had been organized for the
                    region in May of that year. My personal responsibility was to oversee the person
                    who was handling the information activities and make sure they were timely and
                    got to the right people and were up to date.</p>
                <p>And, then, third, I played more of an external information role, participating in
                    various meetings about the drought and US response to it, and was a spokesperson
                    for issues related to that. At some meetings Interaction organized, we were the
                    interlocutor with them; we served as staff in preparing some of the testimony
                    that both Lois and John gave on the Hill about the relief effort; and had some
                    meetings with staff of different committees on the Hill ourselves.</p>
                <p>Then, not unimportant, my role was to keep the task force staffed so that we
                    would have some people to carry out these functions. That actually turned out to
                    be one of the more difficult aspects of this whole thing because of the
                    situation I mentioned before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular lesson that stood out from that
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think the lesson is one that reinforced my earlier experiences and
                    that is, where there is commitment, where there is concern, on the part of the
                    countries where a natural disaster is occurring then an international response
                    will be much more successful in attracting resources and they will be much more
                    effectively used. When you contrast the drought experience in southern Africa
                    with similar relief efforts in other places of the world that maybe have been
                    the result of natural causes like drought, and more recently civil wars and
                    other kinds of things, the difference between the southern Africa drought and
                    some of those others is largely explained by the fact that you have in southern
                    Africa by and large countries with governments that took responsibility for
                    their countries, which cared for their populations and took pragmatic actions
                    that were designed to meet the needs in their countries. They did not play
                    politics with it, did not use food assistance as a tool in an ongoing political,
                    or in some cases, a civil war situation. Not that none of the countries in that
                    region are not corrupt, but in this case there was very little of attempts to
                    profit from the relief effort, not a Somoza in Nicaragua after the earthquake in
                    the late '70s situation. But there was a sincere concern and interest in
                    relieving the potential hardship and suffering of the people. I think that is
                    what really made it successful.</p>
                <p>I guess in another way it validated the organizational approach that we took,
                    which isn't always the approach that AID has taken with its task forces for
                    relief efforts. We very consciously played a role that was facilitative, was
                    catalytic, was information sharing. We did not take on a role as a SWAT team
                    that would serve as the channel of our resources, a special task force that took
                    responsibility away from the line offices that are in charge of that. Our role
                    was the opposite. We were the ones at the center, but it was just a small core,
                    and our job was really to help the other offices carry out their
                    responsibilities better. Through the lens of the urgency of the southern Africa
                    drought, we tried to make sure it got priority attention among all of the other
                    demands that these offices had to respond to. We tried to break through
                    bottlenecks and figure out what the problems were and that sort of thing. So,
                    our role was not an implementing role but was really to try to get others to do
                    their job. This didn't take responsibility away from other, and even though we
                    were a small group ourselves, we really had, in effect, the staff and resources
                    of all of those other offices to respond to the drought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Does that pretty much cover that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think that covers that. Two things were happening by the end of that
                    year, 1992. One is that, despite John Hicks' and my earlier discussions about
                    possible more permanent assignments in the Africa region, it didn't look like
                    anything was actually going to be opening anytime soon. There was an interest in
                    continuing the southern Africa drought task force, and in fact making it into
                    something of the core for a more permanent organizational fixture in the Africa
                    bureau to handle complex emergencies and droughts. One of the crises that was
                    coming on the scene very much at that time was the Somalia situation. As would
                    be obvious from the comments I just made on the success of the drought in
                    southern Africa, I didn't see a lot of those same characteristics in Somalia,
                    but instead a lot of bickering, a lot of foreign policy considerations coming
                    into play there that were more competitive and formed by different world views
                    than was the case in southern Africa. I enjoyed working on the drought for a
                    number of reasons, because of the constructive and positive attitude of a lot of
                    the agencies, and also because it was southern Africa, the region that I had
                    worked in and knew. But, I wasn't really interested in making that a major focus
                    of attention, particularly if it meant getting into some of the more complex
                    issues politically like Somalia.</p>
                <p>Assignment as deputy director of CDIE - 1992</p>
                <p>At the same time I had conversations with John Eriksson, who was the director of
                    CDIE, and Wendy Stickel, who had been the deputy there and was leaving for
                    another assignment. John was looking for a deputy. I decided that that would be
                    something that I would really like to do.</p>
                <p>I guess I should say at this point that, at the end of 1992, the last two and a
                    half years had been pretty much of a roller coaster for me. I had gone to the
                    War College for eight or nine months and had kind of a mixed experience there; I
                    had real difficulties getting back into the agency and into assignments,
                    particularly the Africa region, that I was interested in; I had spent nine
                    months in the Europe bureau which was very stressful and difficult, and then I
                    ended up going for seven months to the task force for the southern Africa
                    drought. I was beginning to feel that I was adrift, that there wasn't much of a
                    place for me in the agency anymore. The agency had changed a lot. I felt the
                    traditional development programs were being eclipsed by the new priorities in
                    Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Resources were declining. The
                    political priorities of Israel and Egypt and to some extent in Central America
                    were still very high. None of those things were what I really wanted to do.
                    Africa was still an attraction, but for whatever reason things weren't working
                    out for me to get back there and play a significant role in the Africa
                    bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>At that point it was clear to me that within three years or so I was facing the
                    expiration of my time in class in the senior foreign service. We, my family, had
                    made a decision that we wanted to stay in the Washington area. In 1992, I had
                    one son who was a junior in high school and the other one was in eighth grade,
                    and we wanted to stay here for the duration of their high school years and not
                    think about going overseas for some time. So, I guess I was looking for an
                    opportunity to do something that I really would enjoy, but with the view that it
                    would probably be my last assignment. I wasn't looking for something that would
                    necessarily be a step up the ladder in the conventional sense, not something
                    that would likely get me promoted. This was not an unhappy situation in some
                    respects, because I had felt a growing distance between myself and the agency
                    and the kinds of things that it stood for, and was thinking that a pre-mature
                    retirement would not be an altogether negative thing.</p>
                <p>So, when I talked to John and when the offer to be the deputy director of CDIE
                    was made, I really looked at it in a very positive way. I considered that I had
                    a significant period of time, two or three years, where I could try to get back
                    to some of the roles that I played in Ecuador, where I could become involved
                    with a substantive program and make a contribution to the agency. It was kind of
                    a step sideways or backward again, but it was something that I would enjoy doing
                    and something that would be a good place to spend my last few years in AID. And,
                    so, in December 1992, I moved over to CDIE as John's deputy.</p>
                <p>That started out to be everything that I had hoped it would be. CDIE was carrying
                    out an excellent series of activities, very much at the core of a lot of what
                    AID was beginning to grapple with in terms of the whole results orientation and
                    strategic planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to elaborate a bit more on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. CDIE had and has still three key roles or functions. The first of
                    those was the traditional central evaluation function. An office that conducted
                    evaluations, cross-cutting evaluations, of agency programs in a variety of
                    specific areas.</p>
                <p>The second was the development information function which included the AID
                    library, the repository of AID's institutional memory on its program experience.
                    This memory, I remain convinced, is one of the greatest assets of the agency and
                    is unlike anything that any other donor agency has. Within its research and
                    reference service, a core staff of researchers were able to work with that
                    information data base and provide tailored and specific responses to questions
                    that AID officers and others had about AID's experience and help them
                    incorporate them in their program design or implementation activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>The third area was a relatively recent one that began in the '90s, called
                    performance measurement or performance monitoring. In the late '80s or early
                    '90s, partly as an outgrowth of an attempt to try to get more information about
                    the results AID programs were having across the board—not just through anecdotes
                    or a small set of crosscutting evaluations, but more to sum up what results the
                    agency was having—CDIE helped to support, first on a pilot basis and then
                    institutionalizing this in Africa and Latin America, a process of program level
                    strategic planning, identification of objectives and results, and systems to
                    measure progress made toward those objectives over time. The key impetus for
                    this began in Africa in the mid '80s in the legislation that was approved for
                    the Africa region and created the Development Fund for Africa. The Development
                    Fund for Africa allowed the Africa bureau much greater degree of flexibility in
                    its programming. Up to that point, AID's programs were all funded through one of
                    five or six accounts. But the Development Fund for Africa gave the Africa bureau
                    the flexibility to make decisions on programming irrespective of those
                    functional accounts. In exchange for that, the legislation asked for more
                    reporting from AID on the results that it was accomplishing with those
                    resources. So, the Africa bureau first, in 1987-88, began to put in place this
                    more program level planning system of defining key objectives for its assistance
                    efforts and then indicators of performance at different levels. Building on that
                    experience, CDIE worked with the Latin America region, and to a lesser degree
                    with the Asia bureau, to try to extend that approach.</p>
                <p>Out of that, by the early '90s, by 1991 or 1992, emerged what was called the
                    PRISM system or the Program Performance Information for Strategic Management
                    system. It was a system for defining, at a program level, certain key strategic
                    objectives for AID's programs in a particular country, some intermediate
                    outcomes—initially called program outcomes—that were more specifically the
                    result of AID activities, and then a series of performance indicators at both
                    the strategic objective and the program outcome levels through which performance
                    towards meeting those objectives would be tracked.</p>
                <p>At the time, in the early '90s, this ran parallel to the project system. There
                    were still projects which had their own goals and purposes and outputs and all,
                    but the attempt was to try to rise above the individual project structure to
                    make more sense out of what we were really trying to accomplish, what were our
                    key goals in a particular country. CDIE was the central coordinating point for
                    this effort. We had a major institutional contract that provided technical
                    assistance to missions in conducting those planning exercises and in dealing
                    with performance measurement issues and eventually in helping us to report at an
                    agency level the information on results that was coming out of that system.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>When I first went to CDIE in December, 1992, we were putting together the first
                    annual report on program performance of the agency that drew from that PRISM
                    system. A draft was already in place. One of the first things I did was to work
                    with the people in the performance measurement office and try to improve or edit
                    the draft of that report, to try to make the most sense out of—and the most
                    easily read case that we could make for—the information that was coming out of
                    that system. My role in CDIE as the deputy director was mostly the internal
                    management of the office. One of the priorities I had throughout my time there
                    was to try to work to take the maximum advantage of synergies among the three
                    organizational divisions of CDIE, the evaluation, the development information
                    and the performance monitoring functions. I think the history there had been
                    pretty much that those operations were grouped under CDIE administratively but
                    each largely carried out its own thing, with some degree of information exchange
                    with the others, but did not exploit the kind of synergy that I thought
                    potentially existed.</p>
                <p>So, one of my principal personal challenges and tasks was to try to look for ways
                    that those divisions and functions could work together more closely. I realized
                    that, in terms of the organizational chart, it was only at my level that all of
                    them came together. As the deputy director, I was in a unique position to know
                    what was happening, for example in the development information area, and try to
                    pass that on to the performance measurement or evaluation offices and make that
                    input into what they were doing, and vice versa. I tried very consciously to
                    play a role of facilitator, the communicator and say, “Hey, you guys should get
                    together on this,” or to begin to look for opportunities for mutual
                    reinforcement between the different kinds of things.</p>
                <p>Actually, throughout my time in CDIE that was something that I did do and from
                    all reports, including by the people involved in CDIE, some of whom had been
                    there a number of years, we did give that more emphasis and were quite
                    successful in promoting that sense of one office, one center within CDIE and
                    looking for ways for people to reinforce each others work. I think that was a
                    success. There is a lot more that can be done in that area, there are always
                    centrifugal tendencies for people to go off and do their own thing, but I think
                    that was one area that did work out pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>The real frustrating part of this and, of course, the part that really upset my
                    vision of this a nice place to go for my remaining AID life where I could try to
                    make some progress on some very important things and make a contribution to the
                    agency, was the fact that a new administration came in just as I went over
                    there. I went to CDIE in December, 1992 and elections were in November, 1992 and
                    in January a new administration came in. It is really hard for me to express the
                    sense of frustration and, in some ways, dismay that, personally, after having
                    survived twelve years of Republican administrations and really wishing that AID
                    were focusing more on the poverty related development issues that certainly had
                    been a priority in the Carter administration, that when a new and like- minded
                    administration came in, that they would treat me and us generally as the enemy.
                    But, there was very definitely that edge to things. There was a feeling, I
                    think, among many people—I won't attribute this to Brian Atwood but to several
                    people under him—that the career people who had been in the agency for a long
                    period of time and through the twelve years of Republican administrations were
                    part of the problem, couldn't be trusted. It was like welcoming a liberation
                    army only to be accused of being collaborators with the regime that had been
                    overthrown.</p>
                <p>Much more specifically, and something that had serious ramifications for CDIE and
                    for me personally, one of the priorities the new administration had was to focus
                    a lot more on results. AID was under attack, was in a crisis period without
                    precedent in the history of the agency, not only from the congressional side but
                    from the think tanks and others. There were lots of reform and reorganization
                    proposals—combining AID with the State Department or just tearing it up and
                    throwing it away all together. There was a tremendous crunch on resources. It
                    was not a good environment for the leaders of the agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>But, this recalled my Haiti experience with the different styles of Jack Vaughn,
                    on the one hand, and John Bolton and Peter McPherson. This was, curiously, the
                    John Bolton/Peter McPherson approach of coming in and discrediting anything that
                    was happening already and saying to step aside, they had the solutions, and you
                    guys are part of the problem. This happened specifically with respect to the
                    whole PRISM and our performance monitoring experience. No one would say the
                    system that we had and the reporting that we were able to provide based on it
                    was perfect or met the needs entirely of the agency. Yet it was a start, and I
                    thought then and think still that at least 85 percent, if not more, of what the
                    new administration wanted out of a program performance results system we already
                    had and was there to be built on. It put the agency substantially ahead of most
                    of the rest of the US government when the Government Performance and Results Act
                    was passed in 1993. But, rather than be open to that or be open to learn about
                    that, or even to say, “Okay, you guys have done a decent job here but here is
                    what we want and let's see how we can build on what you've done to move this
                    system in the direction that we want,” recognizing that about 85 percent of what
                    they wanted was there already, the administration, in the person of Larry Byrne,
                    very much discredited everything that had been done. They said that PRISM was
                    not what they wanted done and was worthless. They made a number of attacks on
                    the system as well as on the people who were associated with it. I wasn't really
                    associated with it because I hadn't been there but a few months at the time so
                    it wasn't anything that I had any particular vested interest in. But we all got
                    painted with the same brush.</p>
                <p>In addition to that, as part of the discussions and process that Larry Byrne led
                    on the reorganization of the agency, which to some extent reflected this
                    programmatic emphasis on results, he basically proposed that CDIE be dismembered
                    and split up and done away with.</p>
                <p>My reaction to this probably can't be separated from the fact that I had gone to
                    CDIE to get out of the mainstream and to find a nice development-oriented
                    management role that I could have to spend my last three or so years in AID. So
                    when, in the summer of 1993, six months after I got to CDIE, the whole
                    organization came under attack and with that, implicitly, my ability to stay
                    there for a few years, I reacted very negatively and probably overly
                    defensively. Over that summer of 1993 we engaged in sort of bureaucratic
                    guerrilla warfare, I suppose, with various proposals and counter proposals and
                    responses to the reorganization proposals and that sort of thing. It was one of
                    those things that you win the battle but lose the war. In the end, through all
                    of the reorganization proposals and things like that, CDIE remained intact, but
                    we lost the war in two senses. One is that virtually all John and I did that
                    summer. and all of 1993 really, was to defend ourselves from attacks and try to
                    orchestrate a process that would result in the continuation of the Center for
                    Development Information and Evaluation. But, maybe even more fundamentally than
                    that is that we got ourselves very definitely on Mr. Byrne's wrong side. I don't
                    apologize for that at all. Now, from the perspective of being out of AID for a
                    while I can see that that wasn't necessarily a strategy designed to succeed, but
                    it was, I think, the morally right strategy, but then that can sometimes can get
                    you into trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The effect was that those battles, those skirmishes, never ended in all of the
                    time I was in CDIE, They continued until the time I left and maybe continue
                    still. They continued through the whole re-engineering process, which was led by
                    Larry. Again, I maintain that if you take a look at the systems that came out of
                    reengineering and compare them to what CDIE was doing and the programs that we
                    had in 1992-93, the parentage is very obvious. We played an active role in much
                    of the reengineering, but there was always this undertone of discrediting CDIE
                    and what we were doing. This competition between the re-engineering effort and
                    CDIE made that whole process one that was personally very unsatisfying and
                    stressful, but also one that I think from the agency's standpoint really was
                    suboptimal and did not really allow us to build on the progress that had been
                    made and to work that into a new system for the benefit of the agency. The
                    agency lost a lot in the skirmishes and battles and the bureaucratics and not
                    taking advantage of what we had done in a constructive way. I suppose we all
                    bore some responsibility for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The PRISM work continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The PRISM work continued and was folded into, has become the basis for,
                    the re-engineering. So in the end, PRISM wasn't dismantled. We spent a lot of
                    time talking about how to marry its country program focus with more of an agency
                    level framework where at the agency level you could say something about what AID
                    was doing on a number of key agency goals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any fundamental difference between the two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The biggest difference revolved around what could be labeled “top-down vs.
                    bottom-up”. What Larry and others wanted at the agency level was basically to
                    start with some key goals of AID as an agency and then to break those down into
                    the tactics that the missions would carry out in order to accomplish those goals
                    at the field level. The PRISM system had started from the opposite perspective.
                    It was an individual AID mission or country based strategy planning process.
                    While there were some unifying factors in terms of the kinds of things that AID
                    did, there was no attempt from the beginning to make the statement of objectives
                    or the indicators the different missions were using the same. So, when it became
                    time to add up what the agency was doing above the level of individual programs,
                    it was very difficult to do. What they were more interested in was saying this
                    is what AID is doing, not what AID in country X was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did PRISM provide some kind of programmatic framework so
                        the missions weren't free to do anything they wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, PRISM didn't, the agency's strategies and programs did. The various
                    initiatives that Ron Roskins and that administration....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PRISM fitted within that framework?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, but it was neutral with respect to any prescription saying here are
                    the areas within which AID will operate. It was a strategic planning and
                    information system that attempted to capture what missions were trying to do,
                    but didn't limit the menu from which they chose.</p>
                <p>The approach that was eventually constructed was one that drew from the
                    Strategies for Sustainable Development that the new administration wrote in
                    1993. From those strategies, what we came to call a “strategic framework” at the
                    agency level was put together that began to define in terms of goal statements
                    the areas which the strategies said AID should be doing. Those goal statements
                    were used then as a framework, and over a couple annual iterations, missions use
                    this framework to cast their own strategic objectives in a way that was
                    consistent with the general areas that were stressed in the strategies. Rather
                    than having a whole series of mandated performance indicators that would be the
                    same across all programs that were similar, we began to use the strategic
                    framework as a device by which to categorize programs that may have been using
                    different statements of goals or objectives and indicators, as a way to group
                    and to categorize and to aggregate these programs. This was not an arithmetic
                    summing up of indicators in each area, but it was a way of grouping for analysis
                    the kinds of programs that were underway and then looking more closely at these
                    programs and telling the story from that standpoint. So, it became a little more
                    subtle and not exactly an exact aggregation of the program experience in, say,
                    ten different countries, but it gave a device, a structure, for looking at those
                    ten programs and trying to say, “Okay, here is what those programs seem to be
                    accomplishing and there are some that are doing very well and some that are not
                    doing very well.” Then relating it to the agency program in that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>This was the result of several years of back and forth during which some of us,
                    and I will include myself in this, resisted fairly strongly the notion that
                    there should be a top-down system. We felt the development challenges, the
                    development situations in the countries where we worked defied coming up with
                    identical statements of goals and objectives, and identical performance
                    indicators in those countries. The countries had tremendously different levels
                    of development and each had indicated what would be appropriate or a target in
                    their situation, and certainly what would be appropriate in one country was
                    completely different from what would be the case in another country. So, that
                    battle played out over time, as to whether you really could come up with an
                    arithmetic aggregation and summing up of everything we were doing, or whether
                    what we were doing at the level of the 80, 90 or 100 countries in which we were
                    involved was something that was similar and allowed a certain degree of
                    aggregation and comparison, but was in its essence so different that it really
                    didn't allow for just adding up the results that were achieved in all of those
                    countries and coming to some meaningful statement about this is what AID
                    did.</p>
                <p>One of the areas that I think was reasonably well founded in the criticism of
                    CDIE that was made in those days was the evaluation work that we did. It took
                    too much time and was not relevant to what people in the agency were doing and
                    was not used in any meaningful way to improve programs. There had been in the
                    evaluation office a bit of a pendulum swing. There was a period, I guess, in the
                    '80s where the evaluation work was funded at a fairly modest level. Around 1990
                    a lot of the attention was given to evaluation by Ronald Roskins, the
                    administrator. In fact, one of the initiatives of that administration was
                    something called the Evaluation Initiative. That was done in reaction to what
                    was perceived to be a variety of shortcomings in the central evaluation
                    function. It described a new and reinvigorated evaluation function that would be
                    funded and staffed at a much more significant level. The evaluation initiative
                    incorporated the PRISM performance monitoring experience as well. But, in terms
                    of evaluation studies themselves, it said we really needed to do more of these
                    and needed to put more resources into them and the studies themselves need to be
                    rigorous, much more independent and credible.</p>
                <p>The response to that was a lot of money and a build up of staff, but also putting
                    into place a number of procedures the effect of which was to make the evaluation
                    studies a much longer process than probably had been the case up to then. There
                    was more emphasis on approvals at different stages, and the concept of external
                    reviews of evaluations, both in the design as well as various drafts, was
                    incorporated. The evaluation initiative focused a lot of attention on rigor,
                    independence, objectivity, the whole notion that the evaluator should be apart
                    from the organization so as not to be influenced, not to corrupt any findings
                    that a real objective examination would indicate.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I think those changes by themselves didn't necessarily translate into what
                    occurred, which was that many of the evaluation studies that were begun under
                    the initiative in 1991-92 still weren't finished two or three years later. But
                    there were two things that did occur and I think helped cause that effect. One
                    is that it took a year, really, for the staffing of the office to build up to
                    reflect the increased levels of the initiative. This is the same period we were
                    talking about before, 1991-92, when there was tremendous competition from the
                    new programs in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It was
                    the same issue that we had when we were working on the drought task force.
                    Resources were just getting very thin and it became a competition and a struggle
                    and a less than zero sum game. So, people who were taken to fill positions to
                    build CDIE came at the expense of others and that created some ill will and left
                    a bad taste in the mouths of the evaluation officers in the regional bureaus,
                    for example.</p>
                <p>The other thing is there wasn't the kind of teamwork that there might have been
                    in the implementation of the evaluation agenda. Instead, the evaluation office
                    built up to maybe 15 people, and it may be a slight exaggeration, but only a
                    slight one, to say that everybody had to have their own study, to do their own
                    thing. What happened was we started about fifteen different things, all of which
                    were interesting topics. But the resources weren't grouped to try to get any of
                    them done with any particular priority or urgency, so they all kind of took
                    their own course. As a result, for the first couple of years very little was
                    produced.</p>
                <p>The other process was that, again with some exceptions but not many, the agenda
                    was set largely by the evaluation office based on the kinds of things people in
                    the evaluation office thought were the topics that would, first, be important to
                    the agency, but also were of interest to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there an evaluation agenda produced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was an evaluation agenda produced and it was reviewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on discussions with the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was approved by the administrator and discussed in various iterations.
                    My sense is that the discussions were really more of a reaction to the ideas
                    that were put forward by the evaluation office and people saying, “Well, okay,”
                    rather than a process which attempted to elicit from managers throughout the
                    agency what were the areas concerning them, the questions that they had that
                    could be addressed through evaluations. It was much more a list that was put
                    together of interesting topics, and people who had very busy schedules reviewing
                    them and saying they had no problems with them, rather than suggesting topics
                    that they could really use and which responded to a priority that they had.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>So, you had three things at work. One is that there was a distancing between CDIE
                    and the rest of the agency because we were taking some of their people. There
                    was an agenda put together that I think was largely based on ideas that the
                    evaluation office had that were kind of endorsed but without much ownership from
                    the rest of the agency. And you had a process where everybody was doing their
                    own thing, so everything was taking a long time to do.</p>
                <p>Well, jump ahead two years and we were just beginning to come out, in 1993-94,
                    with some of the studies that were started in at the beginning of the evaluation
                    initiative. First of all, of course, there had been a change of administrations.
                    Secondly, I don't think there was much ownership for a lot of the studies in the
                    first place. And thirdly, even if there had been ownership two or three years
                    ago, there was not much involvement of people who had expressed some interest in
                    those topics in the process itself. So, what was happening was there wasn't much
                    constituency for the evaluation work that was being undertaken and there wasn't
                    a burning interest by people in the rest of the agency for the work that CDIE
                    was doing. CDIE became, in this environment of reorganizations and the internal
                    bureaucratics of things, an easy target.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the studies that were completed during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH:The one that is an exception to what I have said is one that was done on
                    AID's field missions and how they operate, the comparative advantages that they
                    offer. That was one of the first studies, more of a management study, that was
                    carried out in this period and actually got fairly wide attention.
                    Unfortunately, it was finished just at the end of the Bush administration and
                    therefore didn't get much use until two or three years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a study on micro enterprises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was a study on micro enterprises. There were several studies on the
                    environment. There were studies started on capital projects, financial policy
                    reform, child survival and population programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These weren't relevant to the agency's work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>SMITH: The population study and child survival study were areas of continuing
                    interest. The population study was never published because the quality of the
                    work that was done was not up to standard. The child survival one was published,
                    but it was done in a way that was consistent with the view of the evaluation
                    offices being independent and objective. In other words, it was not done in a
                    way that helped to build ownership or understanding or a constituency within the
                    health office of the Global (or Science and Technology, as it was called
                    earlier) bureau. So, even though 85 percent of the conclusions were positive in
                    terms of the experience that our child survival programs had, the ten or fifteen
                    percent of it which involved some constructive suggestions for changes or ways
                    the program could be improved were taken more as a threat and a criticism by the
                    health office. So they engaged in a long exercise to discredit the study and to
                    work against its dissemination and its broad application.</p>
                <p>The capital projects study was one that really wasn't that relevant to the kinds
                    of new policies that the Clinton administration, Atwood administration, was
                    emphasizing. There was one study of capital programs in Egypt that was done and
                    ran into tremendous problems there and was cut short and left a study with only
                    one case.</p>
                <p>There was an agribusiness evaluation that did go through a number of case studies
                    and was published. There were a couple of meetings and seminars held on it and
                    that was kind of it.</p>
                <p>There was an environment series which was in the design stage in early 1993 when
                    I was arrived in CDIE. Some of those reports are just now coming out. It
                    eventually got split into three pieces and in some of those pieces there was a
                    little more effort to involve people from the agency who were involved in those
                    kinds of things, but it just took forever.</p>
                <p>The more successful ones were in micro enterprise finance, and to some extent,
                    venture capital. They became successful, I am convinced, because over time we
                    changed our approach to the evaluation agenda to focus on things that people
                    really had a particular interest in. We shifted the scope of those studies to be
                    things that responded to questions that people had or were curious about. They
                    became more customer oriented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were less evaluation of a long history of activity
                        and more exploring of new fields?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>SMITH: No, they were both. The micro finance one looked at a dozen or so of the
                    world's most successful micro finance projects, not all of them AID financed,
                    and tried to distill from that experience what were the factors in their
                    success. The venture capital study looked largely at the experience of
                    enterprise funds and some of the earlier efforts in venture capital kinds of
                    programs, mostly in Latin America, but the focus was largely on enterprise funds
                    because those were a new program activity in Eastern Europe, and were being seen
                    as something that would be relevant in places like the West Bank, South Africa,
                    as well as the former Soviet Union. So, there was an interest in knowing what
                    the experience had been with the enterprise funds in Eastern Europe. There was a
                    constituency for that.</p>
                <p>Over a couple of years we did two or three things to respond to the situation
                    I've described. First of all, the original evaluation agenda was a rolling
                    agenda over three years, allowing a lot of things to be included. We cut back
                    the agenda basically to be the things that we would work on this year, making it
                    a one year agenda and more of a work plan. The second thing we did was to try to
                    get a lot more input from people in the formative stages of the evaluation
                    agenda. To say, “Here are some of the things that we have thought about, or are
                    underway. If you have some topics that are of greater interest to you, we have
                    the flexibility to take some of these things off and put some of your things on,
                    because we want to respond to the things that you are working on.” We also said
                    that this was not going to work if we had fifteen people working on fifteen
                    studies. What we needed to do was maybe choose three or four each year and put
                    four or five people on each of them and get them done, and then move on to the
                    next ones. In this way we would mass, or group, our resources to focus on things
                    and deliver them in a shorter period of time.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the time I was there, that is basically how we shifted to
                    become more plugged in to the kinds of questions that people had that could be
                    addressed through evaluations, and to complement the things that were coming out
                    of the performance monitoring system with evaluation studies. We also tried to
                    incorporate more of the work of the development information office by having the
                    research and reference service do some of the initial desk studies that would
                    help to form a baseline for the evaluations. We also explored ways to
                    communicate the findings of the evaluations, first more quickly, but also in
                    ways that were more conducive to people reading them and learning from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the questions I have about evaluations is doing
                        evaluations to meet an immediate requirement for current programs, and those
                        evaluations of longer term, historical impact studies that may not be of
                        immediate use but tell the history of what the agency does. Is there any
                        merit or recognition of the need for the latter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think there is. I think this is one area where the performance
                    monitoring and evaluation issues come together. Both functions, I think, have
                    two roles. One is to help improve programs and the other is to give a sense of
                    what results are coming from those programs. I think more retrospective
                    evaluation plays an important role in learning from the experience that AID has
                    had, or any agency has had. It also contributes to an ability to report
                    internally or to others what have been the results of the programs that have
                    been undertaken. So, I wouldn't limit the role of evaluations by any means to
                    topics that are of current interest.</p>
                <p>I think the challenges are two. One, particularly in an environment where
                    resources are limited, is to find a balance between things that people see a
                    ready market for applying in the current programs and those that are, if you
                    will, are one step back, retrospective, documenting for history, the nature and
                    accomplishments of the program. Particularly when there is a stress on
                    resources, the ones that have more immediate application will be in greater
                    demand or will make a greater case for resources. But, irrespective of what the
                    major object of conducting an evaluation is, whether it is for something that is
                    perceived as having an immediate application in the next generation of
                    activities or maybe even the same generation of activities, or whether it is
                    something for longer term learning or documentation of agency experiences, it is
                    very important that they be in a form and be communicated in a way that people
                    who have access to them will be able to learn from them. I think that is a key
                    challenge for people in busy organizations that don't usually have time even to
                    take care of all of the things that they feel they need to do for their own
                    daily tasks, let alone reflect on something that is not part of what they are
                    responsible for day-to-day. So, the challenge, I think, is to find media for
                    communicating the findings of the evaluations that will be conducive to the way
                    people learn and will allow them to internalize those lessons. But, I think
                    particularly in an environment where resources are thin—certainly in the
                    environment that existed in AID the last few years, and I'm sure this is true in
                    other organizations as well—where there is a real questioning of the value of
                    different allocations of resources, money as well as people, there is a real
                    need for the evaluation function and the performance monitoring function and the
                    development information function to be relevant to the needs of the agency and
                    to communicate its findings in a way that people will be able rapidly to
                    understand and to adapt to their situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that brings us to the development information piece
                        of your triangle here. How was that working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think it was working well and continues to work better. The development
                    information function was, of course, one of the targets of the reorganization
                    proposals from 1993. There was, I think, a very clear misunderstanding in some
                    people's minds of what the development information function was. Some people
                    thought that since it had information in the title it must be the same as
                    information resources management or IRM and that it had to do with computers and
                    those kinds of things and therefore should really be part of an IRM function in
                    the agency and part of the management structure that exists. I suppose there are
                    parts of it, if you want to look at it objectively, that could fit there. The
                    whole filing or documenting of the agency record could be a program or a
                    management function. But, the real important attribute of locating the
                    development information function with the central evaluation office and in the
                    policy bureau of the agency was to make it a resource that could be tapped by
                    people in policy development, in program development and program implementation,
                    not just simply part of the formal documenting of the agency's history in a more
                    management sense. So, I felt there was and is a major interrelationship between
                    that function and the other two functions of the office.</p>
                <p>I think that function has performed very well in the last ten years. It has moved
                    away from being a passive library type function into being a much more proactive
                    outreach device. It has served as an effective channel for evaluation lessons,
                    as well as other things, and a capacity was developed there to respond in a
                    tailored way to the questions and concerns that AID officers have overseas and
                    in Washington. There was a view, and maybe it will come to pass someday, I don't
                    know, that if all of this development information were just made available
                    through computer systems to the agency officers than you could do away with the
                    interactive research and reference service. People could do their own research
                    from their own computer desktops, or whatever. I think it is true that some
                    people will be able to do that. Some people are inclined and want to sort
                    through all the mass of information that is there from AID experience and the
                    experience of other organizations and from other sources. But I think there is a
                    significant group of AID officers who, at least for the foreseeable future, will
                    not feel comfortable doing that, will not have the time to do that for
                    themselves, and for whom it is a great service and a much more efficient service
                    to have a resource there they can query and say “here is the problem I am
                    facing” or “here is the task that I am looking at” and “what can you tell me
                    from the agency's experience that will help me in carrying out that task?” And,
                    that is the role that the development information function tried to play. I
                    think it has done that very well.</p>
                <p>There were a number of steps that were taken to integrate it more closely with
                    the performance monitoring and evaluation functions in CDIE. I think there
                    remain some that could be taken, but in general, I think it is a very valuable
                    service and is often the link for feeding the results from evaluations or
                    analyses of results through performance measurement systems back into the system
                    in a very tailored and specific kind of way.</p>

                        issues that you touched on relates to the interest in an agency in learning
                        from its experience. So often we confront people who don't want to know
                        about the past. How do we deal with an organization that doesn't seem to be
                        concerned about what its experience has been or as time goes on considers
                        that experience no longer relevant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It is a challenge for the evaluation office to know enough of the function
                    of the agency and what it is like to be in those more operational roles, to have
                    a sense of what that is being discovered from evaluations is relevant to those
                    people and to those roles. This is one of the arguments, I think, against
                    isolating the evaluation function. What is often done under the guise of
                    objectivity and independence removes people from the line management functions
                    in a way that gives them less and less insight into the kinds of information
                    that will be helpful to those people. So, I think it is important for the
                    managers of that function and for the people performing it to be in touch with
                    others in the agency. That is not at all to say that their recommendations
                    should be slanted towards sort of making apologies for poor experience or that
                    only the kinds of things that are of operational importance today should be
                    looked at. I believe it is possible to have an independent and objective view of
                    the performance of a program or a project or a whole function in the agency, yet
                    still be engaged with people in a way that gives one a sense of what their
                    priorities and needs are so that you can serve those needs with an independent
                    and objective and well done analysis that will be credible and useful to
                    them.</p>
                <p>The last little chapter, perhaps, on the CDIE experience that responds to this in
                    part. After John Eriksson retired at the beginning of 1995, Janet Ballentine was
                    asked to come back to CDIE as the director. She had been the director previously
                    for a couple of years in the late '80s. One of her major emphases was similar to
                    what had been one of her priorities in the late '80s and that was to get
                    underway a series of what were called “impact evaluations” that would be done
                    very quickly relative to the length it was taking for the more traditional work,
                    and also be presented in very short readable sort of New Yorker style format, a
                    style that people would find easy to read and short to fit the time schedule of
                    busy managers. So, throughout 1995 we made a major investment and dropped a
                    number of other things that we were doing on the evaluation side in order to put
                    resources into two impact evaluation series. One of them was in the democracy
                    area that focused on legislative strengthening programs in four or five
                    countries. The other was on energy conservation, a topic identified in a series
                    of discussions that we had. The legislative strengthening series was regarded as
                    a priority by the democracy office in the Global bureau and was viewed as
                    something that would be of use to them in programs they were planning for the
                    future. Likewise, energy conservation was viewed as a priority area that was
                    rising on the horizon for the environment and energy people and was a nice
                    complement to the work that we were just finishing in biodiversity and forestry
                    and sustainable agriculture in the environment sector. So two topics were chosen
                    as the focus of a series of impact evaluations and then a synthesis paper in
                    each area.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Janet, about mid year 1995, moved over to be the senior deputy assistant
                    administrator in the PPC bureau and I was then selected as the director of CDIE
                    to replace her, although at that point it was clear that I was leaving in May of
                    the next year. One of my principal functions, both while she was there and after
                    she left, was to try to get the impact evaluation series organized and conducted
                    and presented in a way that met her vision and the vision that Brian Atwood had
                    through her of what they might be. This, in some respects, was the toughest task
                    of all, because it involved a significant change in the mind set of the people
                    who had been staffing the evaluation office for a number of years and the whole
                    style of writing evaluation reports. And frankly, the way it was approached was
                    not a way that insured the ownership, or understanding, or necessarily anything
                    other than the tacit support of the evaluation staff. So I don't think they were
                    ever convinced that this was the way to go. They did it because someone told
                    them to do so, but somewhat grudgingly. As a result, the degree of teamwork and
                    cooperation that I would have liked to have seen, the degree of openness, of
                    experimentation and enthusiasm that I believe would have been necessary for it
                    to succeed fully, wasn't there.</p>
                <p>Some of the impact studies were produced and distributed and presented in a
                    different way, and that got a lot of positive attention. But I don't know that
                    it was ever really institutionalized or that the staff felt this was an
                    appropriate role for them. I thought that it certainly had the potential to
                    address some of the concerns and take even further some of the things that we
                    were already doing in terms of making evaluation studies more relevant, more
                    readable, more part of a learning experience. Janet kind of pushed us further in
                    that direction than we might have gone in her absence, but over all, despite the
                    fairly positive reviews we got from the individual pieces, I don't feel that
                    that was a particularly successful effort or one that is likely to meet with
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you measure success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, success in the sense that it is sustainable both from the standpoint
                    that the people who were performing the work were convinced that that was an
                    approach worthy of making an effort, and sustainable in the sense that once the
                    primary instigators of that, Janet in the first instance and me as the kind of
                    the lieutenant and agent for pursuing it, were gone it would continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it about that approach that ran against the grain
                        of the evaluation staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think the staff probably looked at the effort as being unscientific,
                    superficial, too quick and maybe as being too operational and not enough of a
                    one-step back perspective. Typically they were done in two or three week visits
                    to a country. The model, which was actually the model from the Doug Bennet days
                    in the late '70s, was to try to involve other AID officers in actually carrying
                    out the field work and writing up the evaluations so that the studies themselves
                    would be both more operationally oriented because mainstream agency employees
                    would participate in them, and also serve as a learning experience for those
                    people by virtue of their participation in it. I think that approach was one
                    that people who regarded themselves more as professional evaluators didn't buy
                    into. It became very difficult to actually manage that process, to get people
                    freed up and then also to get them to set aside time for preparing the reports
                    afterward. So, a lot of the burden for the logistical arrangements, as well as
                    the report writing, fell on the professional staff, and yet they felt their work
                    in some sense was being discredited or diminished because of the way these were
                    carried out. And frankly, and I think one could look at this in a more positive
                    way, but it is one of the reasons, I think, why there was some resistance from
                    the folks there. The style of writing was more of a journalistic style, more of
                    a conversational style, which was different, and people aren't often comfortable
                    changing the way they have done things for a long period of time and there was a
                    lot of pressure to do that. I think over time that it is possible that people
                    could be convinced that there is some value to that, but it is an uncomfortable
                    feeling to try to change and try to do something different. I think that
                    translated, as changed processes often do, into resistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you look at CDIE as a total effort, do you think it
                        makes a different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it does, but I think its potential to do so is much greater than
                    what it actually does. I think the development information side is maybe the
                    best in terms of realizing that potential. It has been the most customer
                    responsive function and has changed over the years to become more pro-active and
                    engaged and I think is doing an excellent service for the agency. Again, there
                    is further that it can go, but I think it is a very valuable service that is
                    pretty unique in the world of donor agencies.</p>
                <p>The performance monitoring side has also been very valuable and was essential, I
                    think, in helping to make the kind of progress that the agency made in the early
                    and mid '90s in strategic planning, performance measurement and sort of lifting
                    one's sights above the project level to focus more on a few key goals and
                    objectives. That wouldn't happen in the absence of CDIE. CDIE continues to play
                    a major role in digesting the results of those various plans and implementation
                    of programs and carrying out re-engineering, trying to make some broader
                    analyses of them and short term purposes as well as to document the record.
                    Again, I think there was an unfortunate period of a couple of years where there
                    was more battle, competition and struggle over that during which we lost a lot
                    of time and a lot of opportunity to make even further progress. But, I think
                    CDIE is still making a major contribution there.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>On the evaluation side, frankly, I am really not that sure. Anecdotally, in sort
                    of an ad hoc way, I think some of the work that is being done is useful. The
                    most useful work is the work where people were engaged throughout the process
                    with the potential customers or users of the information, where the evaluators,
                    and there were some, who took a more customer service view. They didn't
                    sacrifice their own principles or independence or objectivity, but they did it
                    in a way that was really grounded with a view to how people were going to use
                    the information that was the result of their analyses. I'm afraid that is
                    probably a minority of people. Probably my inability to make more progress in
                    the evaluation area is what I would regard as one of the major failings or lack
                    of successes in my career. I think the evaluation function lost an opportunity
                    when there was a period of a few years where we had no restraints, we had money
                    and people, and yet were not able to translate that into an effective evaluation
                    function that served the agency in a way that the agency regarded as
                    particularly useful. Certainly there are a number of people who made individual
                    contributions and certainly there are a number of things that have come out of
                    that have been useful. But I think, by and large, the product is likely to be
                    more publications that will adorn bookshelves rather than things that will
                    become incorporated into the mainstream of peoples' activities. I see that as a
                    major shortcoming. There are things that have been useful, but I think the gap
                    between reality and the potential in the evaluation function is much greater
                    than in the other two.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired from AID at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I retired in May, 1996 from AID from the position of director of
                    CDIE.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations on a career in international development</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's step back and take a look at your career. What would
                        you say without elaborating in great detail were some of the major lessons
                        of your own experience of what worked or didn't work? How would you
                        characterize what you got out of your career in terms of what would be
                        useful to people wanting to know about development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There are a couple of themes which I have touched upon throughout and to
                    sum up I would just return to. In terms of a long term development program, I
                    think that two things are extremely important. One is that, as a donor, we
                    respond to areas where there is some home grown ownership and commitment. We
                    should not come in with our solutions of how to solve problems, but first look
                    for counterparts who already share that vision or first concentrate on a process
                    of policy dialogue or studies or other kinds of getting-to-know you interactions
                    where that basic commitment or ownership of activities can be formed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think if the commitment is not there that by a
                        series of actions you can generate that commitment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Many times you can and where you can't you probably shouldn't be involved
                    trying to do the activities.</p>
                <p>I think, whether it is in Ecuador or other places, there have been experiences
                    with programs where there was not necessarily agreement with a particular world
                    view or policy view at the outset, but through a collegial process of learning,
                    understanding and discussion that was created. And that creates a far greater
                    source of strength and likelihood for sustainability than just coming in with
                    money and conditionality and those kinds of things.</p>
                <p>The other general theme is consistent with that and that is we should really view
                    our work as being in partnership with local people and organizations, not coming
                    in as an independent actor, and we should look for ways that we can partner and
                    create as equal a relationship as possible. It is not always possible because
                    AID is representing the United States government and, of course, the distance
                    between donors and recipients is often difficult to bridge. But, I think our
                    more successful efforts are those that reflect a partnership rather than an
                    uneven relationship between counterpart and donor and that can be formed in a
                    variety of different ways and I think this is extremely important to do.</p>
                <p>In a broader sense, again this is something I mentioned earlier, I still firmly
                    believe that there is a role for an organization that is part of the United
                    States government that takes a long term development perspective. Working with
                    people to help address problems and to solve poverty and inequity and other
                    development challenges is something that will be in the long term interest of
                    the United States. But, often it will run contrary to what others view as the
                    short term interests of the United States or at other times it may seem
                    irrelevant to those interests, but I think there is a role there to play that is
                    and that it will be very beneficial in the long term. If you look at some of the
                    experience in countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, where we had been engaged for
                    30 or 40 years by the time I was there, and look at the underlying support and
                    friendship from organizations and people that we touched, I think that clearly
                    created an environment in which people were much more responsive and receptive
                    to US ideas and interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the foreign assistance program over the
                        years you were associated with it made a difference? Did it have an impact?
                        Is the world a better place because of it or was it irrelevant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>SMITH: I definitely think that it had an impact and made the world a better
                    place. It was not irrelevant. There are places where I was, Haiti was one, where
                    the effects of what we were doing in the late '70s and early '80s when I was
                    there in many important respects have kind of disappeared, have been washed out
                    in the flood of events which have occurred in Haiti over the intervening time.
                    Some survived and some have continued to provide models for activities that are
                    presently going on. In terms of seriously helping to come to grips with the
                    problems of poverty and everything that is related to that in Haiti, I don't
                    know that we can really point to a particular contribution there. But, in other
                    places I think it is true and in general I think the AID program is having a
                    very substantial effect in several areas of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what sector do you think it has had its most
                        significant contribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In just about every area. I think probably the programs that have been
                    less successful have been the education activities which often are quite
                    complicated by local politics, but if you look at things like population and
                    child survival, clearly there has been an enormous contribution to the vast
                    progress that has been made in those areas throughout the world by AID programs.
                    If you look at agriculture there has been maybe a little spottier record, but I
                    think overall a very positive record. If you look more recently at some of the
                    micro enterprise programs, not all of the outstanding programs have been ones
                    that have been assisted by AID, but AID has been a player in those for 15 to 20
                    years and has been part of the learning process there and part of the whole
                    effort and I think has made some major progress both in alleviating poverty
                    through small and micro enterprise programs, and learning more about them and
                    involving a variety of other organizations in that experience. I think in
                    Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union the US has played a major
                    role through its assistance program. The success of those experiments is going
                    to hinge on a lot more than our assistance, but I think that, particularly in
                    Eastern Europe, our role has been very important in several key respects to help
                    ease that transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The environment, I think also in some areas. There have been some
                    activities in biological diversity where AID has been a player. I think that is
                    an area which the experience perhaps is a little too recent to really say.
                    First, because the major programs that have a conscious environmental objective
                    are relatively new, the oldest programs being less than a decade old. That in
                    and of itself is not too recent, but I think the kinds of impacts that are
                    sought from those programs when you are talking about biodiversity or other
                    large scale environmental impacts are the kinds of impacts that take a long time
                    to determine. Much of the success of the programs will probably be measured in
                    terms of bad things that were averted instead of good things done and that is
                    always more difficult to tell, sort of counterfactually.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize AID's role in these initiatives
                        in the program areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think AID has been a leader in the health and population area. I think
                    AID has been a leader within the small and micro enterprise area. I think AID,
                    not really so much in most of my career as earlier, was a leader in the
                    agriculture field. That sort of went out of favor in the '80s and the '90s,
                    although a little bit of it is coming back now. I think there were some
                    substantial institutional and technological impacts in agriculture in the '60s
                    and '70s. I think in the whole area of private sector, larger business, it is
                    hard to tell really what impact there has been. I think the resources that we
                    have had to devote to that area, while substantial in some cases, were pretty
                    much dwarfed by the resources of the private sector itself. In a number of areas
                    we have probably played an important role or contributing role to helping make
                    the policy and regulatory environment for business a little more positive and
                    that has had some positive impacts. I guess I would say that throughout the '80s
                    and early '90s, particularly in Latin America, but probably in Africa and in
                    other parts of the world as well, the focus that AID had on policy reform was
                    well placed and had some significant, positive benefits, again the kind of
                    benefits that would be more evident over the long term than in the short term.
                    But, I think that was a real key area that the agency focused on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made several comments about your problem with the
                        relationship between US foreign policy, security interests and development
                        interests. Would you say in general that the political security interests of
                        the US were helpful or hindered the development process that AID was trying
                        to pursue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I guess my conclusion on that is that that was a negative influence
                    overall. Certainly there were some places where they came together and could
                    have been reinforcing, but in general they were a hindrance in two ways. One is
                    that, in the competition for resources in a situation where the pie was getting
                    smaller, it was the political interests that won out, which meant that the more
                    traditional development programs in places where there wasn't an overriding
                    political interest shrunk disproportionately. So, there is a much more
                    concentration, I would say, now in the resources, management attention and
                    staffing, etc., in places that have a high political profile than in places that
                    don't, and those don't necessarily correspond to where the development
                    challenges are, where the poverty is or where our longer term interests
                    necessarily lie. The other way I think it hindered is in places like Central
                    America in the '80s where a lot of resources were available because of the
                    foreign policy interest and AID made good use of them in a number of places. But
                    when the chips were down and when there was a crunch or debate over the right
                    thing to do from the long term development standpoint or from the short term
                    foreign policy standpoint, the short term view usually won out and that made the
                    task a lot more difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn the question the other way around. Has
                        development assistance, the foreign assistance program, been effective in
                        supporting political security interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Again, it is not a black or white kind of situation, but I guess my
                    response to that would be, in general, no. Certainly in places like Central and
                    Eastern Europe I think the answer to that is much more likely to be yes. I think
                    that an argument can be made that in Latin America, Central America, our
                    approach there set back by years the eventual peace processes and prolonged
                    polarization and suffering in the region. I think there is no evidence that our
                    now close to 20 years of focus on drug related problems in South America has
                    achieved anything of a success. While a case can be made that the resources that
                    were initiated through the Camp David Accords in the Middle East have certainly
                    been a factor in keeping the peace process in that part of the world more or
                    less on track, my impression is that the AID program in Egypt is not one that
                    has in a major way forced Egypt to make progress on a number of fundamental
                    development issues. Despite the tremendous amount of money that has been there,
                    there are still some issues of radical fundamentalism in Egypt and those kinds
                    of things which are not being adequately addressed by the government or through
                    the AID program or otherwise. Look at Pakistan, Iran, Vietnam and the whole of
                    Indochina. These have been areas where by and large there has been political
                    pressure and resources thrown at problems and consequently the least likely to
                    succeed. It has been in places where resources were less available, where people
                    had to be more creative, had to build ownership, had to get more impact out of a
                    smaller number of resources that I think have tended to be the more successful
                    kinds of programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last area. How did you find AID as an agency to work
                        for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Increasingly bad. In the early years I was extremely pleased. Having grown
                    up in AID in a way, I guess I did not have an entirely positive view of the
                    agency from when I was high school age and in college, but I was pleasantly
                    surprised. It certainly had a lot of very positive attributes and treated me
                    very well, particularly in the early years, but actually really throughout my
                    career.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>One of the things that is really an attraction is that it is the kind of
                    organization which allows you to move and to change jobs and to be refreshed and
                    to take a variety of career paths over the course of time, but still be within
                    the same organization and have some of the same rules, and contacts and those
                    kinds of things. Frankly, AID was very flexible—I think probably too flexible,
                    really—in allowing people to do what they want to do. It is a very undisciplined
                    organization in that sense for the individual. Certainly I benefitted from this
                    a number of times by being allowed to do what I wanted to do somewhat
                    irrespective of what may have been in the best interest of the agency. I never
                    had any real sense, except maybe in the early years, that anyone was looking at
                    me in the assignment process and saying, “Well, here is what we know about him.
                    Or he is good at this because of the kind of experience he has had, so here is
                    the kind of assignment that will take advantage of that experience.” It was
                    pretty much all where I wanted to go, and what I wanted to do and the whole
                    personnel system seemed to have no sense at all where it was best to match
                    resources with the job. Now, that can be positive or negative.</p>
                <p>I think in the latter years it really became a much more frustrating place to
                    work and particularly the last six years in Washington. Washington has always
                    been a more difficult place to work than in the field, and my views may be
                    colored by that a little bit. It was much more internally focused with more
                    bickering and no consensus about what the agency was. To some extent, that is a
                    reflection of the broader environment in which AID operated. Brian Atwood
                    provided excellent leadership, but between Peter McPherson and Brian Atwood
                    there was a series of interregnums and administrators that were just devastating
                    to the agency in terms of lack of direction. And then when Brian came in with
                    the new Democratic administration, unbelievable damage was done by the attitude
                    that people took, and that just made it very difficult for career people to work
                    and contribute. Many of us were extremely positively disposed to the kind of
                    initiatives that the new administration was trying to take and yet were
                    marginalized and treated very poorly. That I think was unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any general last remarks you would like to
                        make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I don't know that there is anything more than what I have said. I
                    certainly had a good career, a good opportunity to work in a number of places
                    and feel like we made a contribution to things. I think that sums it up.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Not to end on a down beat but the question I would end with is whether it is
                    feasible or politically possible for the US government to really have an
                    effective development agency as part of its government/foreign policy structure.
                    I think the weight of view is running against that. I think all of the different
                    proposals that have been made about combining AID with State only go in the
                    opposite direction, making it more of a short term instrument of today's foreign
                    policy considerations. Today, from some consulting work I have done, I sense
                    that it is the initiatives of the Global bureau that seem to be more focused on
                    development, whereas the regional, geographic bureaus and their programs, PPC
                    and all of that are much more involved in the politics, politics of budgeting
                    and resource allocations. I think that is going in a direction which is very
                    antithetical to having an effective development program.</p>
