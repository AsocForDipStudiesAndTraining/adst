                <p>AMBASSADOR RICHARD K. FOX, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 8, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you could give me a brief
                        summary of your background before you entered the Department of State in
                        1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I would be happy to do that. I graduated from the University of Indiana,
                    majoring in journalism, in 1950. Then I acquired a graduate degree in social
                    psychology. My intentions in those days were to enter journalism, but I couldn't
                    find many opportunities in that field. I therefore took a job with the Urban
                    League in St. Louis. The Urban League was an organization involved in social
                    service work in the black community, trying to develop job opportunities and
                    providing job counseling.</p>
                <p>I spent three years with the Urban League in St. Louis, and did the same work for
                    another three years in St. Paul, Minnesota. After that, I took a position with
                    the Minnesota State government in 1956. I remained there for five years, before
                    coming to Washington in 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What interested you in State Department and its
                        functions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Somewhere along the line, I began to develop an interest in foreign affairs
                    and international issues. But I must confess that what really brought me to
                    Washington was an interest in the Food For Peace program. That program had been
                    announced at the outset of the Kennedy Administration and was to be headed by a
                    later unsuccessful Presidential candidate, George McGovern.</p>
                <p>I came to Washington with the intention of working in that program, but I was
                    unsuccessful in my quest. I then got in touch with Carl Rowen, a friend and had
                    just been appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. He encouraged
                    me to look into the Department. I began to set up appointments in the Department
                    and eventually met Herman Pollack, who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Personnel. We had a couple of long discussions and Herman Pollack offered me a
                    job as his Special Assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>It was an interesting opportunity. I wasn't sure what I could do. I didn't know
                    much about Foreign Service personnel operations. But he was willing to take a
                    chance and thought I might bring a different perspective to the position. We
                    agreed we would give it a try to see how it would work.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, just after I entered on duty, the Kennedy Administration
                    and Secretary Rusk developed a concern about minority representation,
                    particularly blacks, in the Foreign Service. So I found myself devoting part of
                    my time to this issue. That area of activity began to require an increasing
                    amount of time, until I was concentrating on this problem full time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now discussing the 1961-63 period. I wonder if you
                        could describe how you saw the opportunities in the Foreign Service for
                        minorities, particularly for blacks, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: To be frank, it was pretty appalling. Back in 1961, and I think my
                    recollection of the statistics is fairly accurate, the career service totaled
                    approximately 3,000-3,100 foreign service officers. Only 17 were black. Those
                    officers knew each other quite well because they were all traveling a fairly
                    closed assignment circuit. If one looked at their history, one would find that
                    they spent most of their career overseas, either in Marseille, in the Canary
                    Islands or in Haiti or in Liberia. There were, perhaps, in addition a couple of
                    posts in Africa. That was pretty much the circuit for them.</p>
                <p>The efforts to recruit blacks into the Foreign Service were just beginning and
                    were minuscule. The results were not very good. In 1961, there were less than
                    30-40 blacks taking the Foreign Service entrance examination. Only a couple
                    passed the written exam. I don't remember how many passed the oral examination.
                    The numbers increased slightly in 1962 and 1963, but it was obvious that if one
                    followed the standard method of recruitment as a means of increasing the number
                    of blacks in the Foreign Service, it was going to take an awful long time to
                    reach an adequate level of representation.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The Department decided that it wanted to do more than that. Secretary Rusk
                    convened a meeting of black leaders in August, 1961. It was a day-long
                    conference and this issue was the principal subject. From that conference came
                    nine recommendations to the department, two of which I still remember because
                    they were very important. One was that the Department should begin immediately
                    an intensive recruitment program to raise the representation in the Foreign
                    Service to an acceptable level by a number of different means. The other
                    recommendation, which was also important, was that there should be no compromise
                    with quality in the recruitment and selection of blacks. The person who pushed
                    this recommendation hardest was Dr. Kenneth Clark, the eminent New York
                    psychologist, who had conducted a number of studies in connection with the case
                    of Brown vs. Kansas which led to the Supreme Court decision on desegregation in
                    the public schools. He felt very strongly that there were an adequate number of
                    competent blacks available in American society if the Department would only
                    would look for them.</p>
                <p>After that August conference, my assignment was to implement the nine
                    recommendations over the period of the succeeding 12-18 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems in the Department that you had to
                        deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: There were several. One was an attitude in the Department- not particularly
                    overly racist. It was an attitude of unconcern. I think that by and large, the
                    members of the career service did not give this issue much attention. It didn't
                    seem to matter to them very much. No one had really ever called it to their
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This attitude was probably fairly wide-spread in the
                        ruling ranks of the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: That is probably true. Within the senior levels of the bureaucracy, there
                    wasn't any great concern. Keep in mind that in those days, the interest in the
                    Foreign Service was pretty much limited to the graduates of the Eastern
                    universities and particularly those schools in the Northeast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And pretty much limited to males.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FOX: Right. Mainly male. As a matter of fact, the Foreign Service in those days
                    was considered to be pretty much “waspish”. The Department was beginning to
                    express some concern about the concentration of recruits from the eastern
                    educational institutions, but not much had been done about it. The other reason
                    for the under-representation of blacks was probably due to the fact that black
                    people had little knowledge of the Foreign Service. Most black students at the
                    college level had never seen a Foreign Service officer and had no idea of what
                    the diplomatic service was all about. Therefore, at that particular juncture in
                    their life, the Foreign Service did not appear to be an option to be
                    considered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about working within the Department to deal
                        with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: We held a number of discussions with officials at the Assistant Secretary
                    level, during which the findings and conclusions of the August, 1961 conference
                    were discussed. The Secretary made it quite clear that he intended to take some
                    positive steps to change the pattern of recruitment and representation within
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>We also initiated some activities with groups outside the Department,
                    particularly with Presidents of black educational institutions that had strong
                    curricula in the social sciences and in the fields of studies which were
                    emphasized in the written examination. It was a slow and arduous process. We
                    were trying on one hand to change the perception of the Foreign Service held by
                    many outsiders while on the other, trying to sensitize the insiders to the need
                    for increasing not only the numbers of minority officers in the Service, but to
                    also make it a less male-oriented organization which represented largely the
                    Eastern establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably at the time this problem of representation was
                        also faced by other organizations. For example, I am sure that at the
                        University of Nebraska not many thought of the Foreign Service as a
                        potential career. It must have been sometimes very hard to get the word
                        around that there was a career for others besides Eastern university
                        graduates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: You are quite right. If you looked at a list of the ten universities that
                    produced the largest number of successful candidates for the Foreign Service in
                    those days, it would have included Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton, and
                    Georgetown. You didn't find the University of Texas or Alabama or Michigan or
                    Nebraska, which are now well represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were trying to shake an institution which was very
                        comfortable with the way it was going. It was working and assumed that “if
                        it ain't broke, don't fix it”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: That was the attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across any real road-blocks outside the
                        inertia? Were there any people or bureaus who refused to go along with the
                        analysis and the solutions, not necessarily for racist reasons, but for one
                        reason or another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: We did run across road-blocks for reasons that were somewhat difficult to
                    ascertain. The Foreign Service was always interested in protecting itself from
                    invasions from the outside. Therefore, it looked upon any effort to infuse a
                    large number of people, some above the entrance level, as a potential threat to
                    the Service because it interfered with the promotion and assignment process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Service had already gone through a traumatic
                        experience four or five years earlier with the Wriston program, which
                        amalgamated the Civil Service positions into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: That's right. In 1961, the Foreign Service was still recovering from that
                    experience and was not ready to face that problem again. I think also that there
                    were certain geographic areas that were less inclined to be open-minded about
                    this than others because they thought they dealt with governments that would not
                    be receptive to the idea of blacks and other minorities serving in positions
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't this same view was also being applied to
                        women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example, you couldn't send a woman to an Arab country.
                        At least that was the general perception.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: That was the feeling. It went beyond the Arab countries. There weren't many
                    women going to Latin America; they weren't going to the Far East. The only place
                    women were assigned in those days was to Africa. There weren't even many women
                    serving in European posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, you were involved in this effort from 1961 to
                        1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Right. I essentially began this work in 1962, after the August 1961
                    conference. I spent full time on this matter starting some time in 1962. The
                    Office of Equal Employment Opportunity was created in 1963 and I became its
                    first director. That is when we formally established a program in the Department
                    to broaden recruitment into the career service.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We also developed several other ideas. For example, we tried to bring minorities
                    into the Service through the Foreign Service Reserve Corps, which was an
                    appointment authority which was available to the Secretary. We developed a third
                    program which was called the Foreign Affairs Scholars program which was very
                    innovative. This program was in response to our findings that while there were a
                    number of well-trained and attractive black students in the predominantly black
                    institutions, they were having difficulty in preparing for the Foreign Service
                    entrance examination because these institutions had not stressed as much as
                    other institutions liberal arts, the humanities and particularly international
                    affairs. Therefore, the Committee of Presidents that I mentioned earlier, with
                    whom I was working, recommended that we find ways to broaden and deepen the
                    offerings in the humanities and social sciences in a number of black
                    institutions. Dr. Kenneth Clark and I were working closely together. We decided
                    that we would put together a proposal for the Ford Foundation, in which we would
                    seek a grant of $ 11 million for these black institutions. These funds were to
                    be used to strengthen the curriculum at these institutions.</p>
                <p>We went to New York to present the proposal and received a very interesting
                    reaction from the Ford Foundation. They indicated that they had already begun to
                    work with the black higher educational institutions and preferred to follow
                    their own plans which were not responsive to the needs that Clark and I
                    outlined. But the Ford people went on to say that if our objectives were to
                    increase the number of blacks in the Foreign Service, there should be a quicker
                    and more effective way than the long range plan that the Ford Foundation was
                    developing. Ford indicated that they would entertain another proposal from
                    us.</p>
                <p>Clark and I went back to the drawing board and drafted another proposal for a
                    program to be called the Foreign Affairs Scholars program. This was to be a four
                    year program in which forty students were to be identified every year at the end
                    of their junior year. They would come to Washington for an internship during the
                    summer between their junior and senior years to serve in one of the three
                    foreign affairs agencies (State, AID or USIA).</p>
                <p>We had the cooperation of the top management of all three agencies in identifying
                    a proper organizational location of the interns. That internship period in
                    Washington was to be supplemented by academic studies. We would have seminars on
                    Saturdays, all day long. We were trying to provide both a work experience during
                    the week and a view of how the foreign policy process worked on Saturdays. We
                    had outstanding lecturers who volunteered for the Saturday seminars. At the end
                    of the summer, the students would return to their institutions for their senior
                    year, with the understanding that they would take the Foreign Service entrance
                    examination. If they passed it, they would then move on to the oral
                    interview.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We also agreed that we would finance a year of graduate study for 25 of the 40
                    students selected for the internships each year. Those twenty-five were expected
                    to take the examination at least twice if not a third time. We hoped that the
                    combination of the summer internships supplemented by the Saturday seminars and
                    the year of graduate study would produce a number of successful candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: It didn't produce very many candidates, for understandable reasons. To most
                    of the young people that we in effect enticed into this program, we literally
                    said “This is something you should do”. They had not made any commitment to the
                    Foreign Service and many were already headed into other career paths. Many took
                    the examination; not many passed it. Most went on to do other things. There were
                    a few exceptions. George Moose, our Ambassador to Senegal, for example, came in
                    under this program; Aurelia Brazeal, who is the Minister-Counselor for Economic
                    Affairs in Tokyo now, came into the Department under this program. There were
                    several others: Ruth Davis, who is the Consul General in Barcelona. There were
                    certainly some successes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The written exam is a tricky thing anyway. I speak from
                        considerable experience have both written questions for the written and
                        having administered the oral exam program for over a year. I am not sure
                        what it proves. It proves that somebody has read a lot. It is a hurdle and
                        that is all it is. The people who test high on the exam are no more likely
                        to be more successful than those who score very low or indeed than those who
                        don't pass at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: As a matter of fact, the examination was analyzed by Kenneth Clark, and he
                    found that there was very little correlation between success on the written
                    examination and success in the Foreign Service. That was probably corroborated
                    by a study that was done several years later which led to some change in the
                    examination. But back to the Foreign Affairs Scholars Program—let me make one
                    concluding remark. While it was true that not many came into the Foreign
                    Service, most of them went on to do other things and were quite successful. We
                    had a reunion of former Scholars a few months ago which about thirty-five or
                    forty attended. It was surprising to see how eminently successful most of those
                    people were. There were a half-dozen who entered the law, three are judges with
                    one ready to accede to the highest court of Maryland. One is an outstanding
                    conductor who was a student of Russian history at Harvard. We were attracted to
                    him because of his interest in Russian studies but his avocation was music. When
                    he obtained his undergraduate degree, he had to decide whether to pursue Russian
                    studies or music. He opted for music and went to Julliard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing something for the greater benefit of the US
                        This is of course one of the great problems for programs of this kind;
                        namely to find an absolute, specific way of getting people into the Foreign
                        Service. You left the program in 1965. How did you feel about it? What had
                        been accomplished by the time you left EEO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I felt that I had perhaps done as much as I could do. I had worked hard on
                    this master for about three years and had exhausted all the ideas that I had. I
                    left in place the Foreign Affairs Scholars Program, which was funded by Ford at
                    the level of 600 thousand dollars over four years. That was a substantial amount
                    in those days. It appeared to have promise produce a number of successful
                    candidates for the Foreign Service. I had also recruited roughly 30-35 people
                    into the Department through the Foreign Service Reserve officer corps. While
                    many came in at the junior or middle-grade level, they were candidates for
                    Foreign Service officer positions. A number in fact did convert.</p>
                <p>So I left feeling that I had put in place a number of mechanisms that would
                    produce some results and I was very happy to turnover the reins of the program
                    at that point to Eddie Williams, who was my successor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to Madrid first as Deputy Administrative
                        Officer and later promoted to Counselor for Administration. What did those
                        jobs entail in the period of 1965-1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I had, of course, been selling the Foreign Service. I had been talking about
                    the Foreign Service as a career for black people for three years plus. Now it
                    was time for me to begin to move into the Foreign Service and to accept my
                    responsibilities in this area and to prove that it was a viable career option. I
                    went to Madrid obviously quite interested and hoping to learn a lot and to make
                    some contributions as well, based on my earlier experiences both in and outside
                    the Department. I found out very quickly that the administrative area is one of
                    the most difficult ones to work in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is certainly the most technical. You can't play it by

                </p>
                <p>FOX: It is very much result oriented. You produce or else you have a lot of
                    unhappy people around you. Part of it of course has to do with your
                    responsibilities for comfortable housing, an adequately staffed Chancery which
                    is appropriately maintained. But there are a lot of other problems too:
                    personnel problems, the difficulties of obtaining sufficient financial resources
                    to operate the Mission, and working with the foreign nationals which is not
                    always an easy task.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two quite different Ambassadors. First, you had
                        Anger Biddle Duke who although technically was considered as a non-career
                        ambassador but had been around for a long time. And then you had Robert
                        Wagner. What was the difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: They were certainly very different in personality, in style and in their
                    approach to problems. You were right about Angie Duke. He had been around for a
                    while. He had been Chief-of-Protocol in the Kennedy Administration before going
                    to Madrid. I think he also had had a previous Ambassadorial appointment. He was
                    certainly no stranger to the Foreign Service. He fitted in very well. He spoke
                    Spanish; he had a great interest in Spanish culture and was well liked and
                    highly regarded by the Spanish hierarchy. He did very well. I was with him for
                    three years. He had a strong staff.</p>
                <p>We had a number of interesting problems during this period. The US Air Force lost
                    a nuclear weapon off the coast of Spain. All this started with an air-tanker
                    that was refueling one of the SAC bombers. There was a crash. The SAC aircraft
                    was carrying three or four nuclear weapons several of which landed on shore, but
                    one of which was lost at sea. We stated that we would take every step possible
                    to recover the bomb and did in fact recover it after some time. The concern of
                    the Spanish government and certainly of the Spanish people was that the water at
                    this beach, which was in the south and a great tourist attraction, had been
                    contaminated by the nuclear device. The American government decided we needed to
                    convince the Spanish that this was not the case. We came up with the idea that
                    the American Ambassador would go swimming in the waters as proof that there was
                    no threat of any kind. So he and the Spanish Minister of Tourism, Fraga on a
                    chilly day in April went swimming in those waters while a host of us stood off
                    on the beach urging them on and recording the event with cameras. It was quite
                    an event and captured considerable attention. It also proved the point very
                    quickly that there was no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Spanish government from an administrative
                        point of view? Did you have many problems with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: No, we didn't have a lot of problems with them. The Spanish government had
                    the same kind of bureaucracy with its attendant slowness that you find in a lot
                    of other governments. I suppose we may be guilty on the same score in the United
                    States. I didn't have any great problems with them. They were obviously quite
                    friendly to Americans. We had adequate consultations with them and things worked
                    pretty well.</p>
                <p>We had the problem of the American military presence that we had to contend with
                    at the Torrejon airbase outside of Madrid. We also had a base at Zaragoza, and
                    at Moron and a big submarine base at Rota.With all that American military
                    personnel in the country, there was concern about their activities and their
                    comportment and what happened in the event of any problems between the American
                    military and the Spanish civilian authorities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular problems working in the
                        Embassy during the five years you were there? With the staff? Or the
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Robert Wagner was a very interesting man and entirely different from Angie
                    Duke. Duke was a very sophisticated, socially active man who represented the
                    United States very well. He and his wife, Robin, were very attractive people.
                    Robert Wagner came to Madrid after a long stint as Mayor of New York City. He
                    probably had traveled overseas before, but certainly this role of Ambassador was
                    something entirely new. He arrived unsure of what he was supposed to do and how
                    he was to do it.</p>
                <p>Wagner was a very intelligent man who listened well and he very quickly discerned
                    that the people around him were there to help him, not to hurt him. He listened
                    to their advice and performed very well. The Spaniards liked him because he was
                    a politician and they loved politics. They were particularly interested in New
                    York politics and Bob Wagner could sit and regale you for hours with stories
                    about New York politics. He also had the advantage that as Mayor of New York he
                    had met and greeted a number of Spanish figures upon their arrival in New York.
                    So there was a group of people in Madrid that he had met at one time or other
                    during their visits to the United States.</p>
                <p>But he had a very short tenure in Madrid. He was there for only one year and was
                    replaced in the summer of 1969 by Robert Hill, under whom I also served. You
                    might remember that President Johnson left the White House in early 1969 after
                    Nixon was elected as President in 1968. Robert Hill was President Nixon's
                    appointee to Spain.</p>
                <p>Mr. Hill arrived in early 1969 after having served as Ambassador in Mexico and
                    somewhere in Central America. He was an entirely different personality from his
                    predecessors. So I had the experience of working with three Ambassadors in five
                    years, which keeps alert.</p>

                        first as Executive Director of the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs.
                        You were in that job until 1973 when you became the Deputy Assistant
                        Secretary in that Bureau until 1974. What did these positions involve?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FOX: I had hoped that after the years in Madrid, to be assigned to the War
                    College. That was in the offing and I was looking forward to it very much. One
                    day, out of the blue, while I was still in Madrid, I got a letter from Fred
                    Irving who was in the Bureau telling me that they had requested my assignment to
                    the Bureau and that my assignment to the War College could come later. The
                    reason for this was that they wanted me to become the Executive Director in
                    light of the job I had done in Madrid. I had established my bone-fides in the
                    administrative field as a pretty good manager. The Bureau had an active program
                    with a budget of $37-38 million which was a line item appropriation the State
                    Department budget and a staff of close to 300 people. It was therefore a
                    relatively large operation. I was asked to join the Bureau and decided after
                    getting some information about it that it was probably a pretty good job. I must
                    say that it was one of most enjoyable assignments I had. The Assistant secretary
                    in 1970 was John Richardson who had come from outside the Department, but was
                    very creative and innovative. He had a very clear idea of what educational and
                    cultural exchanges ought to be achieving. No one else in the Department from the
                    Secretary on down really cared very much about the educational exchange program,
                    leaving the Bureau pretty much on its own to develop the program and to try to
                    strengthen it.</p>
                <p>We spent four years working on the program. It was a large Bureau, but it was the
                    only activity in the Department that had a relatively large domestic
                    constituency. That made it both an interesting and different experience for me.
                    We worked very closely with the academic community because we had the Fulbright
                    program in our jurisdiction; we had the International Visitors program which
                    brought foreign visitors to the United States and spread them throughout the
                    country. This program also had support groups in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this Bureau in the Department of State and not
                        USIA, which would appear to be more natural? And where it is now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: The Bureau was there because when the legislation was passed in 1961 it
                    placed the Bureau in the Department or more accurately, placed the programs in
                    the Department. It had always been in the Department, not USIA, but it was
                    obviously not the best arrangement. There were a number of people in the
                    Department and in Congress who felt that it was more appropriately placed there
                    than in USIA. They were determined to keep it in the Department. The people in
                    USIA on the other hand were somewhat chagrined about this arrangement. The
                    programs were assigned to the Department in Washington, while overseas the
                    exchange programs—the Fulbright program—and the international visitors program
                    were really carried out by the USIA posts. It was a jerry-built arrangement and
                    it worked only because the people in Washington—in the Department and in USIA—
                    saw to it that it worked very well. It obviously meant that we had a very close
                    working relationship with the USIA staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't a “dog in a manger” attitude on the USIA

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>FOX: There was some of that. I think they were somewhat resentful that the
                    programs had been assigned to the Department. On the other hand, it offered some
                    very good assignments to USIA officers when they were back in Washington. These
                    officers would be assigned to these programs in State. This arrangement also
                    provided State officers an opportunity to develop and manage programs and
                    budgets. That opportunity was not available in any other assignment in the
                    Department. We used that fact as part of our recruitment pitch to get FSOs to
                    accept assignment to the Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you see as your main tasks in your particular
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: First of all, we had a budget to develop and to defend in Congress before
                    John Rooney and Frank Bow. If you recall John Rooney of Brooklyn, he was a
                    shrewd and savvy legislator and you couldn't put anything over on him. You had
                    to go up there with your facts and you had to know more about the programs than
                    he knew. He had sources that were amazing. Every year, in our appearance before
                    him, we never knew what to expect, what Rooney would be concerned about, what he
                    would take issue with. Beyond that, it was a complicated budget. We had “excess
                    foreign currency” which was available for the programs and we had the
                    appropriated funds. We had to decide how we would allocate these availabilities
                    based on what we assumed to be the priorities among countries for each
                    geographical areas. It had been conventional wisdom from the beginning of the
                    program that the largest allocations would be made to Western Europe because
                    those were the countries that were closest to us in political and strategic
                    terms. But yet John Richardson and some of us felt that we should begin to look
                    at the developing countries to see what linkages and connections we could build
                    with them through the use of the Fulbright and international visitors exchange
                    programs. We began to change the allocations to reflect that interest and to try
                    to strengthen the relationships with the newly developing countries. We were
                    also concerned with some of the newly industrialized countries, such as Japan,
                    to see what kind of linkages and inter-cultural connections we could make with
                    them long before the American public became conscious of the fact that Japan was
                    going to develop into an economic and technological giant.</p>
                <p>We spent a lot of time thinking about what the programs could be doing to
                    strengthen inter-cultural and international understandings and
                    communications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have battles of Europe vs. Africa vs other places
                        in the financial resources allocation process? I would think that European
                        Bureau would question some of your thinking on the grounds that we would be
                        losing our ties with France, for example, by transferring some of the money
                        to Africa.</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FOX: We had some inter-bureau contests; that is, to the extent that we could get
                    the geographic bureaus to express an interest in the exchange programs.
                    Interestingly enough, in those days, EUR was not as interested in this activity
                    as was NEA and AF and EA. They were the ones that were beginning to see the
                    potential of these programs for support of political objectives over the long
                    run. They were the ones who wanted larger allocations of funds made to the posts
                    in their regions. To that extent, we did have some bureaucratic squabbles, but
                    none were really serious.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other areas of work in this period that you

                </p>
                <p>FOX: There were a couple of other things that we did in those days that might be
                    of interest. There were a number of fledgling organizations that were developing
                    during this period—the “sister cities” program, the “Friends of the Americas”,
                    “The People to People”—. These were the early volunteer programs that were being
                    supported largely by public funds and volunteers. The directors of these
                    programs came to the Department and to the Bureau requesting support and
                    endorsement. The Bureau wisely decided that these were activities that could
                    have great benefit to the American government and people over a longer period of
                    time. We gave them support, we gave some financial assistance. We drew them into
                    a network of organizations involved in educational exchanges that kept them in
                    touch with us and we with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a major effort made to insure that they didn't
                        go completely in their own way without some close coordination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Yes. Not necessarily coordination, but simply assurance that they had the
                    best information available to them as they tried to develop their overseas
                    connections. We kept them informed and were always willing to consult with them
                    when they needed some information about what reception they could expect in any
                    particular country. It was a very interesting job. I enjoyed working in the
                    Bureau very much. After three years there as Executive Director, I was asked to
                    move up to Deputy Assistant Secretary in charge of the country programs. Since I
                    had been involved in the financial resource allocation process for three years,
                    I knew the country programs quite well. I spent a year as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary before being asked to take an assignment in personnel. That was the
                    next stage in my career.</p>

                        it cause a problem for you and the CU operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I don't recall that Vietnam affected the exchange programs in any
                    substantial way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Personnel, what was your assignment and
                        with whom were you working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I had been in the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs for four
                    years. I had expected to be in the job of Deputy Assistant Secretary for another
                    year, but Nathaniel Davis, who was the Director General of the Foreign Service
                    then called me one day and asked me to have lunch with him. The result of that
                    was that he wanted me to take the job as the Deputy Director of Personnel for
                    Counseling and Assignments. Personnel operations was an activity of which I had
                    some knowledge, but I didn't know the inner workings of the personnel system. I
                    thought about the offer for a little while and asked Davis why I should take
                    this job. He said that it was a job that needed to be performed and secondly, he
                    said that he had in mind some changes in the personnel operations in the
                    Department and was trying to assemble a team of people who could help him to
                    effect those changes. He said that he thought I could help. With that kind of
                    invitation, it was pretty hard to turn the Director General down. Nat Davis had
                    a powerful personality. He kept after me until I decided that I would take the
                    assignment. I transferred from CU in the summer of 1974.</p>
                <p>I found the personnel job perhaps the most difficult one I have had in my life.
                    First of all, the personnel operations of the Department are very complex and
                    almost unmanageable. This was particularly true then because the geographic
                    bureaus controlled the assignment process. They decided who they wanted and who
                    they didn't want. They held on to the people they wanted and would turn those
                    that didn't live up to their standards over to the personnel system to be
                    reassigned. Making assignment in those days was a real bartering process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOX: Right. What you saw above the surface wasn't always the actual story. That
                    were a lot of deals that had been made between people in the Bureau and those
                    coming back from overseas assignments that we in Personnel knew nothing about.
                    We were sitting there proposing what we considered to be a series of rational
                    assignments for people returning from overseas only to find that none of these
                    conformed in any way with what the Bureaus expected or intended to have happen.
                    The Bureaus were in control in those days, so that when they refused an
                    assignment we had to start the process all over again. That was my introduction
                    to the personnel operations of the Department and I found it one of the most
                    frustrating experiences I could possibly have had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a lot telephone calls from senior officers
                        around the Secretary, for example, giving you instructions on how to handle
                        individual cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>FOX: No, there was not so much of that as there was the bargaining among the
                    Bureaus themselves and with us. It was a matter of the Assistant Secretary
                    calling the Director General requesting the assignment of certain officers to
                    positions in his jurisdiction. The Assistant Secretary would state that the
                    officers were known to him or to his Bureaus officials, that they had been
                    assigned overseas in certain positions which qualified them for the onward
                    assignments. This would happen after my office had already proposed assignments
                    to the Bureau of other people and after negotiations had already taken place
                    about our proposals. If the Bureau officials couldn't stare me down, they would
                    return to their Bureaus and report that Personnel had been uncooperative. Then
                    the Assistant Secretary was asked to call the Director General. The D.G. was of
                    course interested in supporting his staff's recommendations, but he realized
                    that if the dispute were to be appealed to one of the Under Secretaries or to
                    the Secretary that more often than not we would lose.</p>
                <p>That was one of the activities in which I was involved. I also was deeply
                    involved in the assignment of senior personnel, proposing DCM candidates and
                    participating in the preparation of slates of career officers for Ambassadorial
                    assignments. I spent a lot of time reading files. I think I read the file of
                    every Foreign Service officer in Classes 1,2 and 3 within a three-four months
                    period. That was not an easy feat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing that people who are not familiar with the system
                        might miss is that although the Foreign Service has a fair promotion system
                        — I say that based on personal experience having served on selection boards—
                        the position to which one is assigned—which is a frequent occurrence in a
                        system that requires movement every three-four years, particularly at the
                        senior levels—is absolutely crucial to promotion opportunities. Therefore,
                        in many cases, an assignment is a matter of life and death and an effort
                        will be made by all involved to make sure that their friends or the “right
                        “person, as they see it, will be given the “right” assignment. This provides
                        far greater pressure than in probably any other negotiation conducted by the
                        State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Right. You characterized it correctly. Assignments were viewed then and now
                    as the stepping stone to promotions. If you got the “right” assignment then it
                    was believed, and probably correctly so, that you would get the next promotion.
                    Foreign Service officers pay a lot of attention to the kind of assignments they
                    are going to receive and they consult widely with lots of people about their
                    careers and the positions they should be seeking. There is a lot of trading with
                    one officer willing to help another now on the assumption that the latter may be
                    in a position to help the former in the foreseeable future with his onward
                    assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served a stint in personnel and I dined out on that
                        experience for years. I can't think of any other major organization where an
                        assignment in personnel, which is generally a fairly routine task in most
                        other institutions, is highly prized and many “bright stars” have obtained
                        assignments to personnel because this is an important element to have in
                        their career—to know how the system works and to develop contacts within
                        that system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: That is a very valid observation. I would also add that officers sought jobs
                    in Personnel in order to help with onward assignments for a number of people who
                    might subsequently might of assistance to them. As I completed my first year as
                    Deputy Personnel Director, Nat Davis was reassigned to Assistant Secretary for
                    Africa Affairs. Carol Laise was appointed as Director General—the first woman to
                    be so honored—. One of the things we discussed as she was breaking into the job
                    was a way to change the personnel assignment process in the Department.
                    Specifically, what we had in mind was the centralization of the authority for
                    the assignment process in the Office of Personnel. We thought that her arrival
                    was the propitious time for forwarding a memorandum to the Secretary. You may
                    recall that about this time, Secretary Kissinger had become concerned about the
                    concentration of assignments of particular officers to a single geographical
                    area. He felt that there was too much of this in the Foreign Service and he
                    proposed something which was called “global outlook program” (GLOP). So
                    Personnel had already begun back in 1974 to try to wean people away from their
                    primary geographical area and to assign them to a second geographic area. We
                    thought that this effort, coupled with the GLOP notion and the attempt to
                    improve the utilization of the Department's personnel resources, gave us the
                    best opportunity to propose to the Secretary that the whole personnel assignment
                    process should be centralized in the Office of Personnel. With the Director
                    General's blessing and strong support, that proposal went forward.</p>
                <p>To our great surprise, the Secretary agreed to it. We later found out that his
                    agreement was only part of the picture. The rest came when we tried to get the
                    geographic bureaus not only to agree but also to implement the proposal. You
                    haven't experienced difficult negotiations in the Department until you get
                    involved in trying to get geographic bureaus to give up powers that they
                    consider vital to their own interests. It was a very, very difficult period of
                    negotiations that took place. As a matter of fact, I spent another year in the
                    Office of Personnel from 1975 to 1976 trying to implement the new personnel
                    operations; i.e. the centralization. I must have worked 15-16 hours each work
                    day and Saturdays as well because we had to be able to present a convincing
                    justification to the bureaus for each assignment made which would over-ride any
                    of the ideas they had about the acceptability of people already in the
                    Bureau.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOX: Nobody wanted to leave EUR, of whom I am aware. On the other hand, you had
                    those who had served in Africa, slogging their way through those small posts,
                    feeling that they had served in that region long enough and wishing to see
                    another part of the world. Same was true for the Latin-Americanists. So this was
                    a difficult period.</p>
                <p>There were some other interesting developments at that time. The economic “cone”
                    was beginning to be perceived as a very important functional activity in the
                    Department. The economic training course at FSI had been running for sometime
                    and a number of officers had been through it. That was essentially an
                    introduction to the fundamentals of economics. It was sufficient to qualify you
                    for an assignment as an economic officer, but you could not be considered to be
                    a qualified economic officer until you had several tours after that. There were
                    competitions between “cones” at that time. Political officers were beginning to
                    see that the route to fast promotions wasn't necessarily in the political
                    “cone”. Opportunities were better and brighter if you were an economic officer.
                    That generated a number of attempts to transit from one “cone” to another. In
                    addition, there were a number of very interesting opportunities developing in
                    the Middle East at that point. There were small posts with a number of DCM
                    positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example, there was the Persian Gulf posts—Abu Dhabi,
                        Bahrain, Qatar, etc—which were opening up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Right. Those were interesting assignments then. The assignments were largely
                    going to the economic officers because of the economic issues which were
                    predominant in that area. The political officers were being left out of these
                    opportunities. That was one of the reasons for the attempt to change from the
                    political to the economic “cone”. But all these issues were converging at the
                    same time: the Secretary”s interest in having officers acquire knowledge in a
                    second geographic area, centralization of the personnel authority, the concern
                    about the “cone” designations and the attempts to move from one to another, and
                    then the breaking of the lock that the geographic bureaus had on the assignment
                    process. I went into the job with little gray hair and two years later emerged
                    as an old man.</p>

                <p>FOX: I don't really know. I wasn't in Personnel at time. I had been told in 1974
                    when I was still in CU that I was the Department's candidate for the post in
                    Barbados. My name had actually gone to the White House. Unfortunately, the White
                    House had a political appointee in mind. By 1974, I had been a Class 1 Officer
                    for several years and presumably I was being considered for appointment to
                    Ambassadorial assignment. I think it would have been just a matter of time
                    before I would come up for consideration again. After the job in Personnel and
                    the Senior Seminar, I was on a couple of lists.</p>

                        1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Back in 1977, the Carter administration had indicated that it wanted to
                    strengthen our relationships with the Caribbean, and particularly with the
                    Eastern Caribbean. We had come through a period of time in the latter part of
                    the Kissinger era and during the Ford administration when it was felt that we
                    had tended to over-look the countries in the Eastern Caribbean. We had not
                    really supported them and yet they were our closest neighbors. They supplied a
                    large number of immigrants to the United States—I am referring primarily to
                    Jamaica and Trinidad and Barbados—. I had done a paper when I was in Personnel
                    pointing this out and suggesting that we had made a mistake in assigning
                    non-career people to the Ambassadorial positions in that area when ideally we
                    should have career officers there who could recognize the importance of the
                    relationship between the Caribbean and the United States. That may have surfaced
                    at some point and may have led to me being considered for one of those jobs.</p>
                <p>Back to your question concerning our interests in Trinidad. The Carter
                    administration had announced at its beginning, the “Caribbean Initiative”. The
                    idea was to try to strengthen our relationships with those countries through
                    some direct support and through multilateral assistance as well. They needed
                    help because in 1973 the oil prices had sky-rocketed and all of these countries
                    were facing very serious debt problems. They needed some means of servicing
                    their debt as well as some funds for internal economic development. The
                    Secretary had gone down to the Caribbean in early 1977, had visited each country
                    and had stopped in Jamaica for a conference at which he agreed that he would
                    propose an Caribbean initiative which would have the United States attempt to
                    persuade a number of Western European governments to form a consortium of
                    donors, that would make funds available to these countries for debt servicing
                    and internal economic development. Trinidad was the only country in the
                    Caribbean that did not need this kind of assistance because it was an oil
                    producing nation. Trinidad had profited from the increase in oil prices. Our
                    interests therefore in Trinidad in those days was to get it to agree to be a
                    donor. I went there with instructions to try to move Trinidad in that direction
                    to the extent possible and to do all we could to keep it supportive of the
                    Caribbean initiative.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had some problems because one of the countries that had been identified as a
                    major donor was Venezuela. The relationship between Venezuela and Trinidad
                    historically has been very poor. Eric Williams who was then Prime Minister in
                    Trinidad had always looked on Venezuela as an extremely racist country. He was
                    very critical of Venezuela. One of reasons for this attitude was that the
                    Venezuelans would allow Trinidadians to enter Venezuela but they could not
                    become citizens, even if they married Venezuelan nationals. He thought that this
                    was typical of a racist government and so when we began to talk about donor
                    countries and mentioned Venezuela among them, Mr. Williams was offended by this
                    idea. I had to keep the Trinidadian government aware of our interests in
                    proceeding with the initiative and to persuade them that Venezuela would not be
                    the prime mover. The United States would be chief sponsor of the proposal and we
                    hoped that the British and the Canadians and the German and the Dutch
                    governments would provide assistance. We had however to approach others in the
                    area who had enormous of amounts of assets to contribute.</p>
                <p>We also had some US investment In Trinidad which were to protect. We had a
                    navigational facility, the OMEGA station, was extremely important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the government of Eric
                        Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: It was extremely difficult. Eric Williams was a recluse and as a matter of
                    fact, he was characterized as being manic-depressive. He had periods when he was
                    very visible and socially active, but then there were long periods when he would
                    seclude himself in his residence and would only be available to his Cabinet. He
                    was a very difficult man to deal with. He developed the idea that he as Prime
                    Minister would not be available to any foreign Ambassadors. We would have to
                    work through his Foreign Minister. However, I did see him on a couple of
                    occasions when he was interested in discussing an issue with me. When I had
                    instructions to get in touch with the Prime Minister, he was never
                    available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your main dealings were therefore with the Ministry of
                        Foreign Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FOX: Main, but not solely. Trinidad had in addition to their oil production large
                    amounts of natural gas— a by-product. In those days, we were concerned about
                    having an adequate supply of natural gas. The Trinidadian government decided
                    that they had a sufficient supply of natural gas to export it and the United
                    States was the obvious market. They began discussions with us about developing a
                    facility for gas liquefaction. They also began negotiations in the US about
                    sales. They quickly found out that liquefaction is an extremely expensive
                    venture because you not only had to be build a plant in Trinidad, but also had
                    to have tankers for transportation and then you had to deliquify it in the
                    United States off-shore and pipe it to terminals on the mainland. The brunt of
                    those costs would have to borne by the Trinidadian government. In addition, they
                    had competition from natural gas from Canada as well as from Alaska and it
                    appeared that the US would have an adequate supply.</p>
                <p>So I had long discussions with the Minister of Petroleum about this proposal. We
                    also discussed with the Trinidadians their foreign reserves which at that time
                    amounted to two-two and half billion dollars. They wanted to start a very
                    ambitious development program, at the center of which would stand an iron and
                    steel mill. When the people in Washington heard that Trinidad was considering
                    building an iron and steel mill, it caused a great deal of concern because our
                    steel industry was in the throes of a down-turn at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was period also which lasted till today during which
                        steel was in surplus—it is one of those products that looks wonderful and
                        employs a lot of people, but the product is going begging.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: They had done a very quick survey and they found that there was a shortage
                    of construction wire rods in south-east US They considered that situation as an
                    ideal market. They had talked to a number of wholesalers who had indicated a
                    willingness to handle the product. But they had not done an adequate survey of
                    the market and had not really looked very carefully at the potential costs and
                    at the long-range market before committing themselves to this plan. They came to
                    Washington to talk to the Export-Import Bank about credits and loan guarantees
                    in order to build this plant. They got a commitment from Ex-Imp that it would
                    support the plant; subsequently, the Bank backed down. This generated another
                    long series of discussions about the US government reneging on its promises.</p>

                <p>FOX: Yes. Technical in the sense that I had to learn quite a bit about the oil
                    and gas industry, which was relatively new to me. I had a very good economic
                    officer and had good support from Washington.</p>

                        separate entities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I treated it as a whole, but the government did not. The government treated
                    Tobago as a separate entity. The government had very strong ideas about their
                    own counties. Tobago was separated by about forty miles of water—beautiful
                    island—but poorly developed, very inadequately developed. There were several
                    hotels. It was largely a tourist area for the people of Trinidad. Had the
                    government decided to go into tourism, it could have been another Jamaica, it
                    could have been another Virgin Islands, it had beautiful beaches, with shallow
                    waters and a sand-bar that goes about fifty yards off-shore. A lot could have
                    been done with natural resources, but Mr. Williams did not want all these
                    people, particularly Americans, turning his country into a tourist haven. He
                    therefore refused to consider any tourism development in Tobago.</p>
                <p>The government in Trinidad felt that the people of Tobagowere always critical of
                    the central government and were not very supportive. So they didn't treat them
                    very well. This generated internal political disputes that occurred
                    frequently.</p>

                        with American tourists or businessmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: No. I had no problems with either. The number of American tourists was not
                    great. The travel between the US and Trinidad is usually the
                    reverse—Trinidadians going to the United States. Therefore the tourist problems
                    were minimal. US investment was not large at the time I was there. The largest
                    US firm was Amoco and they enjoyed very good relations with the Government of
                    Trinidad because they were extracting oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Amoco have its own international relations experts to

                </p>
                <p>FOX: They had that office in Chicago which was available to all of their overseas
                    operations. In addition, the Trinidadian Government was cordial to the American
                    oil firms. They had their own network and their contacts within the government.
                    That system operated very effectively. They didn't need any assistance from the
                    American Embassy.</p>

                    pleasantly surprised by the quality of the staff. We didn't have a lot of
                    economic activity with the Government of Trinidad. Yet we had a solid and
                    competent economic officer. Political problems were minimal and we had a very
                    good staff to handle that area. I thought we were quite well off.</p>

                        Assistant Secretary for American Republics Affairs (ARA). What was his
                        operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I did deal with Terry because he came to Trinidad once for a visit to the
                    Caribbean. He had a deep interest in the Caribbean because he was born there—in
                    the Virgin Islands. He had a personal interest in the Caribbean affairs. His
                    operating style was to give the Chiefs of Mission as much support as they
                    needed. There was not great interference out of his office with what we were
                    doing. Yet we knew if we needed to get to him on a particular issue or to get
                    some support either within the Department or outside, we could. I did spend
                    quite a bit of time with him, discussing one specific issue: the tariff on rum
                    produced in the West Indies. We spent some time trying to develop a strategy for
                    attacking that problem.The issue was that the tariff on rum produced on the West
                    Indies was considerably higher than on rum produced in Puerto Rico. The reason
                    for it was that the funds that were derived from the tariff on West Indian rum
                    was used for a federal payment to Puerto Rico. So the West Indians always
                    complained about the difficulties they were encountering to win their share of
                    the market, in light of the high comparative cost their rum. That was a problem
                    which I was aware of when I went to Trinidad. I began to try to solve it, but
                    after looking in to it for some months—talking to people on the Hill— it became
                    apparent that because of the federal payment, there was little inclination to
                    change the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Trinidad-Tobago, you went were assigned to the
                        Inspection Corps as the deputy Inspector General. How was that as an
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I felt quite good about it. The Inspection staff had always enjoyed a high
                    reputation in the Department. It had its ups and downs in recent years, but when
                    I went to it, the whole inspection, auditing and use of resources process had
                    become extremely important. I spent almost four years in that office. It was one
                    of the more enjoyable assignments that I had in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal concerns that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FOX: I was the senior Deputy and therefore worked pretty much across the Board.
                    My main responsibility was over-seeing the inspection process—the inspection of
                    foreign service posts to see how the conduct of foreign relations was being
                    handled. As such, I had to supervise a number of senior inspectors who were
                    heading the various teams that were working throughout the world. In addition,
                    we were beginning to increase the size of our audit staff which was at that time
                    something entirely new and different for the Department's Inspector General's
                    office. We had not gotten into auditing to any large extent up to this time. The
                    passage of the I.G. Act of 1976 placed a much heavier responsibility on all
                    government agencies to look into waste, fraud and mismanagement. Consequently,
                    we were told to increase the size of the audit staff and to combine it with the
                    Inspection process. We were in effect restructuring and creating a new kind of
                    inspection procedure for the Department of State, which took some effort. The
                    posts had to make adjustments in their preparations for and views of
                    inspections. I would add one thing: one of the fundamental tenets that we kept
                    in the conversion process was to try to maintain the practice of never pulling
                    any surprises on the posts. We were interested in a constructive approach to the
                    issues of waste, fraud and mismanagement and not so much in acting as
                    policemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on your Foreign Service career, what gave you
                        the greatest satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: Probably two things: one was early in my career when I was able to, with the
                    help of some others—Herman Pollack in particular—persuade the Ford Foundation to
                    give a grant of $ 600,000 to a group of black colleges so that they could work
                    with the Department on a Foreign Affairs Scholar program, which I described
                    earlier. It was unprecedented to have a government program designed primarily to
                    increase minority representation in the Foreign Service financed by a private
                    non-profit philanthropic organization. It was an extremely ambitious effort and
                    it created a precedent and pattern for others to duplicate.The other high point
                    was my selection as Chief of Mission. That is the ultimate ambition of most of
                    us in the Foreign Service and I was delighted to reach that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If a young black came to you today and asked you whether
                        you would recommend the Foreign Service as a career, how would you counsel
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FOX: I would be most encouraging because as I say repeatedly to young black
                    people, we have a responsibility not only to be interested in and involved in
                    domestic issues in this country, but also its international policies. We can't
                    sit here and complain about US policy in Africa or in Central America or
                    elsewhere, unless we are willing to become involved in it. And not just as
                    observers. We must be participants. That means that some of us are going to have
                    to make sacrifices to enter government service—if sacrifice, particularly
                    financial, is in fact what is required—. Nevertheless they are going to have to
                    make that decision. Some few are going to have to point their careers in the
                    government's direction because that is the only way we are going to have any
                    real impact on the way our government acts and operates in the international
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What response do you get to this view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOX: I get a response that is supportive of the concept, but it is very difficult
                    for young people who are being wooed and pursued by some of our large
                    corporations to think of government service because of the difference in
                    financial rewards between the two groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, I want to thank you very much for your contribution.
                        It will be a valuable addition to our collection.</hi>
